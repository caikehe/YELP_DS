Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.

But none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.

I did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.pricey for what you get (average cut, average color), the place is cramped otherwise nicely decorated but the mold smell from the basement sometimes gets horrendous. Wish they would clean this up, the owner doesn't seem to care.The manager was very nice. The pool was nice and deserted as well as the hot tub. The room was fine but NOTHING fancy.
The 3 people at the front desk ignored us when we first came in. They were on the phone, but couldn't even give us a nod of acknowledgement. After waiting 10 minutes I tried to check in and I told them we had registered online and we were cashing in our Best Western points. Immediately the man checking us in got a strange look on his face and without saying anything he turned and walked into a closed door behind the desk. I was left feeling confused. When he came back he started to ask us a question and the very rude blonde check in girl interrupted him to say, you can't use those points to pay for a room, that has to be done ahead of time ONLINE. We had just driven 5 hours with 2 wild boys in the car to find out we couldn't stay there? That was what my brain was thinking. I was just really confused and surprised at to why she would get so abrupt and defensive and not even ask us any questions. Oh and she was still on the phone. The timid looking check in guy said the manager would be over to talk to us. He still had not said a word about whether or not we could use our points. I tried to ask him, and he seemed to have absolutely ZERO knowledge of how that worked. Maybe he was in training. My husband travels for work and stays at Best Westerns all of the time. He has never had a problem like this. The manager was extremely nice and we gave him our account/approval number from registering online. He was younger than both of the people at checkout and much more helpful and professional. He got us registered within 10 minutes. I just thought someone should know about this incident. I work with people and would NEVER be so rude to customers as the front desk. They never even smiled and we did not get anywhere until the manager came out. We will not be staying there again.My girlfriend and I recently ate here, but it wasn't anything I would recommend. At least, not to anyone I liked...


The Expectation:  Her Dad wanted to take the two of us out for dinner, and his wife had suggested 'The Old Spaghetti Factory'. I had never been to the place before, but I know a few of my family have went there on separate occasions with nothing but good things to say. So, I figured we'd try it, I'd say I was even eager to do so.


The Wait:  We arrived for dinner, roughly about 6pm on a weeknight. We were told by the hostess that it would be about "ten or fifteen minutes" to seat our table of four. At first, I thought that was a little weird, seing it didn't appear ridiculously busy from the lobby or by the amount of cars parked outside, and it wasn't like we were an abnormally large group. But it was cool, they had what seemed like several waiting rooms with different types of chairs and sofas to sit on, and some cool, old "stuff" to look at.

...Twenty minutes later.
It seemed like there were at least three different, larger groups of people that came in after us, and were seated before us. I wasn't really sure how that worked, but, just as I was just about to approach the hostess podium to inquire about our wait, the hostess called our party's name and began to walk us to our table.


The Service:  Our hostess sat us at a four top table, located in one of the corners of the main dinning room. She apologized for the wait, noting that the area we' were sitting in was supposed to be closed, but they were making room in order to seat us, she also mentioned that our waitress should be by in a minute or so. It didn't take long for our waitress to come by to tell us she'd be right with us, but then it took forever for her to return and take our drink order.

One of the least pleasant particulars of the evening was our waitress being super short with us at every encounter. It was like we had done something wrong by sitting in her section. By the time she returned with our drinks, I think we all knew exactly what we were ordering; which seemed to somehow catch her off guard, as if she was stressed to take our order.


The Meal:  I had the Chicken Marsala which came with Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter, and my girlfriend had the Spinach & Cheese Ravioli. Both entrees included bread for the table, and the choice of soup or salad. I had a Caesar (upgraded at an additional cost.) and she had a side salad with vinaigrette.

The salads were alright, iceberg lettuce, which was 'meh' and the Caesar came with tomatoes, which I scoffed at, just a little. My entree wasn't horrible, although, it did seem like a pretty measly serving for the price. It tasted just mediocre, - I could've swore the tomatoes/sauce on the Raviolis was canned, whatever it was, it was pretty bitter. 

I'm usually not one to complain about the waiting staff allowing you to enjoy your meal in peace, but that was not the case in this instance. The waitress rarely came by the table to check on us, at all. She came by and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, (laughable,) if there was anything more she could get for us, or if we needed to-go boxes, while taking our dishes away. She left us, again, for an eternity. Returning with our check and some small boxes.


The Outcome:  I tried to keep the group positive while we sat, as others around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. But without another, much improved dinning experience, I would probably go elsewhere. Honestly, I don't love/hate/mind Olive Garden, but this place wasn't even that good.

I walked my girlfriend back to our car with a disappointed stomach, and a sad little to-go box, both half-full of mediocre food. - Maybe we can go somewhere good on Friday night...I guess that the organization overall is good, but wonder why one of the most needy populations in all of our communities is dismissed by this organization.  I am referring to kids who are in foster or kin placements through CPS.  I know we have tried multiple times to get children hooked up with a big brother or sister only to be told that CPS kids are too transient with their case managers and placements so they wont work with them.  Who cares if the case manager changes, if the kid is in a placement that wants to have them stay there for years or even adopt them.  Case mangers and social workers at schools and hospitals change but they will set those kids up with Bigs.  I don't understand why this company wont work with Arizona CPS kids.  

Kids who have been removed from their parents are more at need of a positive mentor than any other population, yet are pushed aside by VBB-BS.  And when you ask for a reason why all you get is the "they are transient" story. And I guess the kid with the single parent who cant keep a job is stable?

They appear to me to be an example of "get the good PR", and forget the rest.Being from Southern California, the "scene" is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable.This was a sadness pile on a failure plate.   I have had worse but never in a place so widely considered a treasure by the Yelping community.  From recent reviews it looks like this place is a shell of its former glory and that's sad, because the potential is there. From my experience tonight, the rumors may be true.I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich...was not that great. The chicken meat lacked any flavor. And the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy. Plus, no sides and no kid options!! Just FYI...What happened to you?

This place, specifically this Macayo's, used to be so good when I was a kid. I came back here last weekend and I was so disappointed. Everything about this place just seemed way sloppier than how it used to be.

Essentially, Macayo's is one of the staple eateries of Phoenix. It's like a bastard cousin of Garcia's (RIP). It's the typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing too spicy but plenty of taste and it's heavy too. It's true though what the reviews have described it as: a Mexican TGI Friday's or Denny's.

It's so sad to see Macayo's in the state. It's like that girl you used to think was cute when you were in junior high... but then you bumped into her a few days ago at the grocery store and she looks worn out in every sense of the word after surviving through four kids and three divorces. C'mon, Macayo's! Take care of yourself!Oh, AJ's. If you didn't exist less than 3 blocks from my apartment, I would never go to you. Although you have high-class pretensions, and several amicable sommeliers, your employees are aware that you are a ripoff.

Case in point: I go to AJ's on St. Paddy's day, 2010, looking for some corned beef. 1 corned beef steak remains. About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10. I mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter, and I quote: "Hahahahahahahaha!!!" -- Nothing else. No joke. They know they're overpriced. They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.

Furthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.

Avoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.I'm thinking that the normal staff was off yesterday. 

I went to Cherry Blossom with very high hopes thanks all the positive yelp reports and was very disappointed. This onetime experience won't stop me from coming back to give the Cafe another chance...as I think I might have been transported to a parallel universe for this meal. 

First off... cute little place, there is no doubt that this is not a chain. The interior of the restaurant is simple and looks more like your dining at an authentic Asian bistro in Vancouver rather then in a central Phoenix strip mall. Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked. 

I ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a "bonus" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I'll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate... 

so when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff. 

When my "shrimp" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste... 

My friend's pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...

The strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.Overrated! Service was terrible and food was below average. Tables were dirty and server refused to get cucumbers from the sushi bar, even we offered to pay for them. I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/I'm done with the antiquated Turkish bazaar style of sales "technique" car dealerships provide. In this day and age we shouldn't have to spend multiple hours going back and forth just to make a purchase. Sitting in empty offices while the salesperson disappears to "talk to my manager" - don't BS me, I've seen Fargo, I know what you are really doing.

Everyone uses the internet to research the type of car they want, you can look up the MPG, the cargo room, the legroom. You know what colours are available and what trims. You can even look at the dealer website and see what inventory is in stock, complete with accessories and MSRP* (The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment. See your dealer for details)

So I had gone onto the GMC website, found the exact model of vehicle I wanted to buy with the exact specifications that fit my need and my budget. I got a generic email from John, the Coulter Internet Manager telling me he's my man. There were two models listed in stock, so I sent an email to him with the VINs of the cars I was interested in, together with the make model and mileage of my trade-in. I never heard anything back.

So a couple of days later I walk into Coulter. This is not your typical dealership with hundreds of cars on the lot, there are maybe 6 cars out front and a couple more in the showroom. Imagine the scene - I walk into the showroom which has car salesmen all hanging around each others desks, chewing the fat and yucking it up. They scatter like cockroaches when I walk in. An older gentleman approaches me, 

You looking for parts?
No, I want to buy a car
Well if you are looking for parts, it's down that way
No, I want to buy a car
Oh, come this way

That's how I met Dean. Dean has a PhD. I know this because it's on his business card AND on the door plate to his office. Don't ask for Dean if you are in a rush, because he moves like molasses. Up we go in an elevator, through a door to a second floor garage. We are looking for the car I am interested in. Dean is half listening to me. I tell him that I have the exact car I need to see. I tell him that according to your website you have two in stock, one silver and one white. Let's find either of them. He doesn't know where they are. We look in the garage; we look out on the lot. We go back down the elevator to his office. I give him the VINs, he disappears, comes back and off we go to try and find either of the two cars. After much searching and much shuffling we find one of them, out on a parking lot, behind the service area, mixed in with private cars and one with the whole side missing. Yep, you guessed it, Dean doesn't have the keys.

When he finally returns with the keys, he reluctantly takes me on a test drive. No you can't drive it out of the lot, we have security. Where is this security when we were looking for the car? Maybe they can instigate a search for the white one I was really interested in. We then go on the most pedestrian test drive ever. No freeway exposure, just literally around the block. I'm driving a V6 I want to let it go, see what it can do, but nope.

So the car drives well, the MSRP is right. All that is needed now is to work out how much they are going to give me for my trade-in. As a good internet user I have researched the Kelly Blue Book value of my car. The KBB trade-in value is low, I expect that. They offer a range based on the condition of the car, from a low number if the car is ready for the scrapheap, to a high number if it is in pristine condition. I figure I'm somewhere in the middle. But it is what it is and with the range in hand we begin the negotiations. Cue Dean's exit again, this time with my car keys.

At first he can't get the VIN entered into his computer, so he figures he wrote it down wrong, then he takes his iPhone and snaps a photo of it, that doesn't work. He asks me if I have my insurance card and he reads the VIN off that. Finally, he gets the computer to accept the number. Lots of button pushing ensues, then he curses the printer, then he prints something, then he's off again.

When Dean finally returns, he has a price for me. $2,000 less than the low price on my range! Are you kidding me? At least he doesn't try to spin me a line about the age of the car or the condition. Just this is the price, take it or leave it. I say I'll leave it. This is a critical time in the car sales negotiation process, I waited half a second and then it came.

"What can we do to get you in a new car today?"

I said you can stop insulting me with that price and offer something within the KBB range. Ok, he says, "Let me go talk to my manager". So Dean makes his final departure. When he returns he shakes my hand and says we are getting nowhere, just wasting each other's time and goodbye.

So here I am, three hours later no further forward in the car buying process than I was before. 

Sigh. I wish Amazon sold carsLet me just say that, despite what you may have been lead to believe, I am not that cool. I still think Alanis Morissette is cool. I still wear black and pink sometimes. That is how uncool I am. I am not cool, and will probably never be cool, by the exacting standards of Buffalo Exchange. 

I know this. I knew this. But I cleaned out my closet and ended up with a stack of mostly designer duds that no longer made me feel fancy... it was time for me to brave the arctic wilderness of shirts with pearl snap buttons and dresses with cowboy boots that is Buffalo Exchange.

I see that some reviewers are a little insecure about their coolness. "They didn't take my stuff! I hate them!", or, "I didn't have enough body mods to be considered an indie badass! Eff those heartless hipster drones!" 

Listen, dudes. Who really cares what some icy jerk at Buffalo Exchange thinks about you, or thinks about your clothes? I already know that I am not cool enough for Buffalo Exchange. That is why I was stolid and unsurprised to receive little more than a dismissive grunt from any of the buyers/sales staff working there today. Actually, one of them did call me "honey" at one point. I liked that. 

While the gentleman at the "buy" counter was perusing my stuff, I wandered around and saw a lot of cute things, some outrageously priced and others, very reasonable. I saw a few shirts that I've purchased at Last Chance over the last 6 months hanging on the racks there, for triple what I bought them for. I also saw some cute designer shoes, jeans, and dresses at prices that are truly a steal and a half. Really cute accessories, too. I had to use major restraint in that department. 

They took, like, 3 items out of the multitude of junk that I hauled over there. I wasn't itchin' for a fix or trying to pay a bill or needing to buy baby formula or whatever other reason there is that people might complain about the amount they're receiving for their clothes. I took my sweet $16.50 in trade, and peaced. 

Was anybody nice to me? Not really. Did that make me feel bad? Nope! Avoid Buffalo Exchange if you have a fragile ego, and if inscrutable, potentially unfriendly facial expressions bother you. If you're just there for the deals, and couldn't care less about the trappings, you will probably spend $20 on something cute and go home and feel a little bit cooler.I found my uncle's Fossil watch in a box of old pictures on Christmas Eve. He died 9 years ago so it was a very sentimental find.  I wanted to get it resized, shined, and it needed a new battery as well.  I called ahead and asked if they did watched repair which they said they did. While they did replace the battery they maladjusted the watchband and as a result the watch would not latch.  This was very disappointing since it now fit worse than before. The young man who had been helping me admitted to not knowing what he was doing and that they did not have a watchmaker on staff and was kind enough not to charge me for the battery.  He meant well so the experience wasn't a total bust. However, better to say you don't know how to fix something than try and fail at the expense of the customer's time.All UPS stores aren't created equally (they may have the same look 'n' feel, but they're individually owned). I've stopped in here a couple of times -- on one occasion the employee didn't seem to know how to work the copy machine, and on another occasion I discovered that this location doesn't do passport photos. On all occasions, this particular store has had an unkempt, cluttered appearance which seems unprofessional. The last time I was in here (which will be the last) I noticed the mailbox fees on the wall. Why someone would rent a mailbox at a UPS store instead of the much less expensive post office-option is beyond me. I also never got the impression of "I'm happy to see you, customer! How can I help you??"

My advice is to avoid this store. If you need UPS services, visit the UPS store on the SEC of Camelback & 32nd St.I travel thru-out the country and stay at many hotels but I was not impressed with the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix. The staff is welcoming and pleasant but the hotel itself is not up to the standards of what a Ritz-Carlton should be. The rooms are outdated and the gym / pool area are small. To be honest, I've stayed at Hilton Garden Inn's that were better. I'll be staying somewhere else the next time I'm in Phoenix.Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened. The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business. This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber. I don't plan on going back there again.I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.

This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I"m sure the view would have been nice.

In summary.... 
Average age: 65 
Food quality: sub par 
Decor: antique 
Bill with discount: $110 
Recommend? NOThe last time we ate at Houston's, we waited 90 minutes for a table. They had quoted 45. We complained. They told us "just five to ten more minutes"  a few times. I was super hungry and expected something to be comped. Anything. I guess they didn't feel the same.

And let's not kid ourselves - the food is just okay. I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice. Dining here makes you feel like you have money, even though it's not very expensive. Or maybe that's just me.The location is pretty much the only reason I stick with this place-it's right around the corner from my house...
the is always a couple broken machines and the place is smelly (not like typical gym smell because I'm a practical person, I realize people sweat...I'm talking needs to be cleaned smell) and couldn't be paid enough to use the locker room.
Additionally, there have been a lot of reports lately about cars being broken into and theft. However, the staff is very nice and I get the workout I need so I'll be sticking with it for a while.T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it.  The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.  
I saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction.
The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure.
With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.  
We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that "some" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??  
So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him.
I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one.It seems to me that many Phoenicians have a "jaded" (pun INTENDED) view of what real, authentic Chinese food looks and tastes like, and those people are the ones who said this was the best Chinese food they've ever had. 

I'm sorry, but I was NOT that impressed with the food here. I came here last night with a group of 6 people and we did the whole "family style" thing. A couple people ordered potstickers and said they were really good (and at least the waitress warned them that they would take 15 minutes to make) but others were not that impressed with the wonton soup. 

My dish was actually pretty good (Ginger Chicken), but a couple of the other plates looked a little sketch (I mean, the Walnut Shrimp was literally a plate with shrimp, then a huge serving of broccoli and then a pile of walnuts....IT WASN'T EVEN MIXED IN!!) I was also disappointed with the "fried rice" they served with the meal, which was just fried with some soy sauce (no eggs, no veggies). The Mu Shu was ok, but I actually prefer the one at P.F. Chang's. 

All in all, it wasn't horrible, but as the 2 Star rating indicates, I've DEFINITELY HAD BETTER!! 

Almost three stars for great service, though!!!I have not been here in awhile, so I thought since I am in the area I will pick up a lunch togo.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special (chicken, rice, and an egg roll).  I bought it back to the office, it smelled good and the togo box was stuff with food.  I wished it tasted as good as it smelled.  The sauce was kind of bland.  I was so bummed.  I guess I need to find another chinese take out place.Good prices but bad service.   I shopped and found a nice set for a good price.  I went home measured and ordered online in the morning on a Thursday.  Later on Thursday early evening I had not received a call.  I called the store and confirmed they received the order.   I had requested a Saturday morning delivery online.   The rep told me that usually they have a 4 day window for deliveries but he would do me a "favor" and schedule it for Saturday.   Are you JOKING?  The competitors all have next day delivery.   I had to be nice since I wanted the Sat. Delivery so I thanked him.  On Saturday morning I had not received a call.   I called and they said the store does not call, the customer has to call for a delivery time.  Oy!   HELLO, the customer should not have to work so hard!   The delivery was delayed past the 430 time and you guessed it they NEVER called.   I threatened to cancel the order and it was at my home 15 minutes later.   I will NEVER go back.  They lost another customer.We were invited here with some friends and the food and drinks and service were alright.They were not terrible, but not worth going back for. Just very cheesy and greasy and I am sure a fat and calorie bomb!The prices are ridiculous here...$55 for a used bookcase that you can buy new at Ikea for $30?

  I came in looking for a decent used suitcase.  They want $30 for a nasty old thing that might have cost that much when it was new.  I can not understand why they would price donated items so high.  People that shop here want a bargain and will just go and purchase something new if there isn't much difference in price.   Sad for the charities this store supports.I was tempted to go with a one star on this one, but I finished SOME of my dinner.  We ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful. The delivery driver was super nice, but it was all downhill from there. We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken and vegetable chow mein. The egg rolls were fine, nothing exciting. Good crispy wrapper, not over-fried, with a flavorful inside. According to my BF the hot and sour soup was great. However, the entrees were really terrible. The General Tso had no spiciness at all and the sauce was very gelatinous. It was almost more like a hot and sour sauce, with almost a ketchup-y aftertaste. The breading was soft and mushy (which I guess is to be expected for delivery) but the chicken inside was super yucky. WAY overcooked, rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken. I ate about three small bites and gave up. It was probably the worst GTC I ever had. And I've eaten a lot of bad General Tso's Chicken. The chow mein was edible but not what I would call good. It was almost flavorless. The veggies were ok and had more flavor than the noodles, but overall it was little more than something to chew and swallow, not really enjoy.  I definitely wouldn't try this place again. I guess the quest for decent Chinese food delivery continues.Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!

The chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!

Miguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!Not sure if 2 stars is fair or not, so here's my story.

We rent 2 small (5X5) units from them and have for years now. Over the last few years they have changed managers several times. They have also upgraded their automated access a few times.

We've been locked out before for non-payment (they system automatically does this) but it was never urgent. Today it was, They have pay at the gate so it cost me $79.00 to get in, they were closed so I either waited or paid.

It's important to note that we have never had a late or missed payment since we've been doing business with them. When I go in there they always fix the problem right away. 

The facility is always clean and well maintained. If it wasn't for their automated system locking us out all the time I would probably have given them 4-5 stars. The billing/lockout problem has gotten worse over the years but the property itself has improved. I guess the bottom line is it doesn't matter how nice it is on the inside, it's useless if you can't get in.

Update 12-14-09
They were very apologetic and will  be refunding me the money. The regional director even sent me an email. Great customer service, tech department needs work. Now that the regional director is involved maybe it will get fixed.Meh.  There's so much better food and service out there in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  We tried this place again, only to be disappointed by the small portions and very poor service.  Our third time here was not a charm!Ok if you are looking for a quick fix of sushi / sashimi, but nothing to go out of your way for. Pleasant staff but a little ho-hum , some strange patrons !

If you want a good sushi bar go to Yasu on E.Cactus .I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there.The tortillas are worth 4 stars, but I think the rest is overrated. The machaca always struck me as bland.  Same with the tamales.  I'd much rather go up the street to Ranch Market/Tradiciones.

And the hours are frustrating. Closed Sundays and shuts down too early the rest of the week.  The Cactus location is open later, but the food is no better and the dining room is depressing.I don't get it!

I've heard a lot of about this place so I had to try.  At first glance this place gave you one of those uh-huh moments.  Yep, sketchy and a little ghetto I thought.  However, I risked my life for a burrito before!  I ordered the taco platter and my sister had the enchiladas.  I had to get some hot sauce out of the ketchup dispenser, which didn't look too clean, but I took my chances.  I would like to stress "hot" since it seemed like it was just "sauce".  I can't say too much about the taco since it felt like sustenance.  My sister's enchiladas weren't too bad.  Coming from the barrios of LA I definitely had better Mexican food.  

The place itself is pretty simple. Basic tables and chairs nothing to wow and pop anybody, but I gather they weren't trying to.  Needless to say I've had better.... much better and I don't think I want to risk my life for this.  -  Enjoy!This airport really sucks.  The layout for one is ridiculous.  I felt like we spent most of our two hour layover walking from one terminal to the next just to grab a quick meal.  The saving grace was Paradise Cafe.  It was the only high quality and decently priced place to get a meal that both my child and I would like.  If you're traveling alone I'm sure you can find other places but having a kid really limits the choices!  Also they have a complete lack of power outlets!  Most airports these days have a long row of nice leather chairs with outlets in the arm, but PHX is lacking this.  You just have to hope you can get a seat by one of the columns with an outlet in it, but then you get the death stare from ten other people when you plug in!Not a fan of the airport being 10 miles away from car rental... Easy to get around but plan extra time for the shuttle ride.i first checked out the website before going here, and the website gave me the impression this place was something waayy different from what it actually is. Total let down, i was expecting to ride some good rides, when actually this place is for kids.. i mean little kids. Only two rides you can consider adult friendly, and still were not all that impressive. the one big roller coaster is alright, but really short and the "Flyer' is probably their best attraction. Would i go back?? prob not unless i took kids..if you have kids they would love it though.I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING it's the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drive-thru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover you've got the wrong items, things you didn't order, wrapped to label what you asked for. 
Granted, at the end of the day, it's all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery.I don't understand how this rates so high.
 As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more.Came here today to get a full-set put on. When I sat down, I requested more rounded tips, rather than square. When he went to file them, I reminded him again to please make them slightly rounder. He seemed irritated with me and shook his head like there was something wrong with me. A few moments later, after studying my nails for a minute or two, I was asked "why do you keep looking at them!?" So, I was honest and replied, "Because I think I would like them a little shorter." Again, I recieved a nasty look and a shaking of the head. He mumbled something and continued on with my nails. I was so uncomfortable! Last time I checked, I was the one paying for the service...I've never had an issue before in getting what I ask for. And mind you, I was the only person in the entire salon. I wasn't taking up any other customer's time! Really unfriendly service.

I had a pedicure after, which was short but fine. She did a nice job. However, I would not come back to this place again.BEWARE THE FISH MINT!!!!

This was a new experience for me.
I've been to oh-so-many pho places all over the country, and not one of them used this traditional (but disgusting) herb called FISH MINT.

Spring rolls - basic - can't go wrong?  oh but it could...

Everyone kept tasting this fish taste and we thought maybe the shrimp had gone bad (we are in AZ, folks).

Then my friend's salad came out.  FISHY.

Then my bun.

I put all the leafy greens in there liberally (I do love my greens), and then I got this big mouthful of... ROTTEN FISH.

BLECH!!!!

I literally spit it out and almost gagged.

Finally I called the waiter over cuz I was bankin' on a free meal (what with the vegetables being left out with rotten fish, or something), and he just laughed and said,
"Oh!  That's diep ca!  It's very good for you.  Some people don't like it... Next time we'll leave it out."

and that was that.

Ick.

Who likes the taste of rotten fish?  I actually like the taste of fish sauce, so it's not like I'm a total nay-sayer on all things fishy... but DAMN... that $h!t tasted NASTY.

I had to google it, cuz I thought he was just making it up.  But there really is an herb called FISH MINT.

BEWARE!!!

The Pho is safe.  Apparently they don't serve it with pho.In short: A monument to crappy-ness.  Decent food muddled by horrible service, becoming a bit overpriced as well.

Well what can I say about best hong kong?  Rather than going on a tirade of negativity, I'll list the good things about it.  The food is decent, half the time...... well that's it, I guess.  Now the tirade: When you go sit there, it doesn't inspire you to eat.  Looks dirty everywhere, it may not be actually dirty but you just feels creeped out.  The staff is rude from owner/hostess up front, any one of the non english speaking waiters, and the bussers.  To get something extra like rice or water is like taking a kidney from them.  Food is sometimes good on not so oily but it's hit or miss really.  Only reason I go there is for the duck, it's probably one of the better dishes anywhere.  I don't bother dining in anymore, just get my duck and vamoose. It used to be pretty affordable, but over time the prices have gone up a lot.  When I started coming here the whole duck was 12$ now half a duck is 10$. 

Although I have never been chased by the staff, two of my friends were chased out to the parking lot demanding 15% or more on the tips.  There service is probably deserves a -15%, it's that bad.  I'm really surprised by the general disregard for customers.  Another funny thing is that the staff understands english pretty well but if you have a complaint then they pretend like they are hearing english for the first time.  It's pretty funny to see.  Don't go here if you can help it.I am in full agreement with others about the equipment condition. Though I get a good workout because of the variety, there are MANY repair issues as evident in all the "broken signs" that seem to stay on the machines forever. Even machines that work could use maintenance. I had been a member 10 years ago and will say that when I came back 5 months ago because of my daughters request, it was a deja vu.....NOTHING has changed. 

As for cleanliness, the place could use a really good cleaning especially the bathrooms. There are many customers at this location so I cannot imagine the repair/cleanliness issue is to blame on financial reasons.  This is obviously a poorly managed location and I have written to corporate 2 months ago with no reply.Dont waste your time, or money. This place is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is great, especially for large parties. They are very accommodating for something like that. However the food is not that great, I would recommend Olive Garden over Bucca any day.I've had good experiences at this Fletchers in the past, but the last few times I've been there have been frustrating.  

They do not have a good system for oil changes - I have waited all day for an oil change more than once.  I have had conflicting information from different employees on scheduling appointments, and when I politely informed one of them, they acted like I was lying.  I agree with another post that sometimes it feels like they are working against you.  As a person myself employed in customer service I have to wonder how being against your customer can ever work for you.

On a positive note, they had the cheapest battery in the area (after checking several other stores, we ended up coming back there).  But my past few negative experiences there have overshadowed the positive ones.

All in all, after they were frustrating on the phone this morning (the oil change run around), I decided to pay a little extra and try Big O' Tires on Crimson.  Customer service was great and it was done over lunch.  I even used a coupon from their website.1677 W. Chandler Blvd.
Chandler, AZ 85224

After arriving home from working the night shift I heard a hissing sound in my garage. Closer investigation revealed a foreign object in one of my car's tires. Drove to the Discount Tire on Chandler Blvd. It was 7:00AM and they don't open until 8:00AM. I parked in front of one of the bay doors just before the tire went flat. At exactly 8:00AM the store opened and several minutes later I was approached by a sales associate. I explained my situation and asked that the tire be repaired. After removing a 6 inch bolt from my tire I was informed that the tire could not be repaired "because of previous improper repairs" made on the tire. (???) The tires were approaching the end of their life so I decided to purchase two new tires. The installation went smoothly. I inquired about the TPMS system (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) being reset and was assured that it had been taken care of. I drove home and everything seemed fine. A few days later a TPMS alarm light began illuminating on my dashboard indicating a problem with one of my tires. The display confirmed that there was no pressure reading from one of my tires. I manually checked all four tire pressures and narrowed the problem to one of the new tires. All four tires were properly inflated but one of the new ones was not sending it's signal to the Unit. Since I had been charged $20.00 for "TPMS rebuild kits" by Discount Tire I returned to the store. A technician brought out his little analyzer and made the light on my dash go out. All four tires were now sending their pressures to my display and the all was well with the world......for about a day and a half. Same problem; different "new" tire. Returned to the store after a few days and repeated the process, with a different technician. When I made the comment about being charged for the TPMS rebuild kits he told me that $20.00 charge was "obligatory"  with all new tire sales. He also suggested that I return my vehicle to the Dealer and inquire about have the system looked at if it was still under warranty.
Long store short.....the dash light came on a few days later and the problem persists.
I'm going to have the Dealer look into it at my next oil change. As for Discount Tire; they lost my future business due to their lack of concern for my problem, (a problem THEY initiated), lack of persistence in fixing it and an apparently bogus $20.00 charge for an "obligatory" TPMS rebuild kit.Stop in on a whim to pick up some pizzas. Got a specialty pizza and some honey hot wings. We even ended up getting a large cheese pizza for $2 since it was a mistake by the cook..so we walked away with a lot of food but were not that impressed. The wings were a huge disappointment for my lova' ( he is a wing man) and they did nothing for him. The pizza was good and settled our rumbling stomach pains but didn't eat leftovers and leftover pizza is one of my favs..for me to pass on it was a sad morning when i usually would have went for that cold pizza which of course, is breakfast of champions.

Wompwomp


p.s it is big inside..good for kids to be loud and run around..tvs and all that..but the food was just meh...The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that.

They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row.I reviewed this Ulta a few weeks ago and I visited again to give it another shot. 

I came in for a sale on NYX baked powder eyeshadows, which were about 40% off. Awesome....IF ONLY THEY HAD THE ITEMS IN STOCK. 

There are about 20 different shadows and I was only able to purchase 10 because all of the others were out of stock and/or damaged.

Next I went on to the NYX liquid liner. ALL OUT OF STOCK.

Maybelline eyeliner, OUT OF STOCK. Maybelline shadow combos, OUT OF STOCK. Almay shadow pallettes, OUT OF STOCK. Everything I came for!?

I asked the assistants walking around if they could check for stock and they said it was "stocked this morning"....even though there is no product. Then another assistant came up and said it hadn't been stocked but she wasn't willing to go look for me :(

How can this Ulta operate when everything is kept out of stock all the time?! This is extremely frustrating! 

I made my purchases, also purchased a large and heavy lighted mirror, which the cashier conveniently placed on top of my shadows in one bag. Seriously? I just got my bag home and 4 of them are cracked/powder is completely out of the socket. 

I am extremely frustrated. I've spent $520 there in the past two months and it is obviously unappreciated. I will stick with MAC from now on.Went once and never again! awful service and food mediocre.Store is clean, greeters are always nice and pleasant, but when it comes to the dressing room, it's terrible! It's always as if I have to beg to try on clothes. The attendant is almost never there, and when they are, they're in the corner not paying attention to customers walking in and out. Rep had her phone bulging in her back pocket, which is tacky in my opinion. There were about 5 people working out on the floor and one on the register. So while I had to witness one representative ring up all these guys clothes and then spend 10 minutes taking off the security tags I just dropped my clothes and walked away.I stopped in here to feed my enchilada-style burrito craving, something that should only be done at a small, hole-in-wall place serving Sonoran style food. Espo's fit the bill on that account, and it has gotten some good reviews recently so I decided to try it out after shopping at nearby Chandler mall.

Right off the bat, I noticed the place was kind of dirty. I wasn't expecting anything immaculate, but I've seen nicer Filiberto's. The tile floor badly needs a mopping.

My veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot. It was mostly a disappointment after that. First off, no sour cream or guacamole came with it which is my expectation for enchilada style. The red sauce was tasty with a very nice kick to it. I still added lots of salsa too which I also enjoyed. But there was way too much of the average tortilla, and the filling was a major letdown. Was I wrong to expect that a veggie burrito would contain veggies? Shredded iceberg doesn't count! The beans were too liquidy, and the rice had little flavor.

This place did nothing for me, but luckily there's plenty of other burritos in the sea.Not going to lie, was not super impressed.  

Used a yelp deal for breakfast, the lady who took our order then walked back and made the food.  

Feel like I could have made the food better at my house.  

Probably won't be coming back any time soon.  

Obnoxiously playing spongebob on the tv extremely loud, even though there were no kids there.$16 per adult is way overpriced. My wife and I went here for the "Chili and Pumpkin Festival." Just calling something a "festival" doesn't make it a festival. How is it a festival? There were very few pumpkins to choose from to take home and after paying $32 to get in, why am I paying another $10 for a pumpkin? Not to mention the $5 snow cone. It's price gouging galore at this place! Unless you like children's rides I don't see how this place is worth $32 for a couple, when you aren't likely to stay more than a couple of hours here.

On the positive side, it was a beautiful day and there were many nice photo opportunities to be had at the corn fields. I just don't see the justification in the amount of money they are charging. Perhaps if you had kids and you took them there for a half day it might be more reasonable. I did notice that the place was lousy with kids and teens. Not good for couples, however, other than picking up a pumpkin for Halloween (which you can do many places) and some nice photo ops.Unimpressed with the lack of attention and follow through of the employee in the guitar accessory area. Wasted over an hour of my time only to find out they didn't have the part in stock. I suggest you try Milano's Music in downtown Mesa instead - better selection and MUCH better service.First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. 

I went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. 

She tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.

They need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.Ive been going to Randy's for years, ever since they were at the old place which is now a Safeway.   Needless to say I've had just about everything on their menu. Randy's used to be a reasonably priced restraunt with great food, but it has slowly turned into an over priced restraunt with smaller and smaller portions.  Breakfast is still a pretty good buy, but lunch and dinner are simply not.  I just came from Randy's and had the buffalo chicken salad like I have so many other times.  The salad was $8 and looked like an oversized side salad.  I have noticed this very same thing on many of there other meals.  I ve probably have had my last dinner at Randy's tonight but I may make another breakfast trip.  To end on a good note the servers are usually the best!Service was lacking!! Took forever for her to take our order. 
But the worst part was seeing the waitress behind the counter and lift her dress and pull her shorts down. There is a bathroom for this!! Then to not go and wash her hands GROSSThis is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.Sometimes Active body has great things but nothing you can not find in other stores, In addition to poor customer service they are rude. Who needs that aggrivation.Went to the melting pot for my husband and I's wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. The service was good the food was tasty, but now I remember why we don't go very often ..because it is so darn expensive and you cook your own food!! It was nice to have the photo of us that they took as a memento, however that was the extent of the anniversary goodies. (They have an anniversary package that they make you pay extra for which we did not get). The restaurant was also super dark inside. Probably won't be going back anytime soon since our bill was well over $100.. Yikes..We found this little cafe by chance and actually had to come back to that side of town in order to check it out.  Service was quick and efficient and friendly until we told the young lady that the potatoe pancakes were not to our liking.  She offered mashed potatoes, telling the cook that she "had some unhappy campers and they need something else".  I had the marlin special which was great but the risotto was just nasty...mushy and not the taste I had expected.  My partner had the pot roast, which was very tender and good but we found that things were very salty.  We started with the trio plate that had hummus which was quite spicy and a great salsa and tomato-based tabbuoli.  We have to share that the worst part of our dining experience was watching and listening to the constant bing of the microwave oven, which is right there for all to see in the little serving window.  Really???  Why are you nuking things before serving?  We watched a pasta dish get zapped for several minutes, taken out, stirred, and slapped back in for another minute or so.As Chart House locations go, this one is hit & miss.  I've definitely had much better luck at the West coast spots such as Malibu, Redondo Beach and Lake Tahoe (on the Nevada side).  Anyway, the Prime Rib is usually outstanding at any Chart house, along with the bread, salads & desserts -- I'm going with two stars for the Scottsdale restaurant because of the service not being what it should compared to the others.  You usually can't go wrong for nice night out if you pick Chart House but in my experience, it seems the Scottsdale one can be 'hot or cold'.Excellent food. Poor service tonight as it's during Barrett Jackson auto show and place is slammed.This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels.I used to love this place. No more...

The pico de gallo used to win awards, but now it's bland. The guac is a version of the creamy goop you get in a bag from the super market... No thank you.

I'm a huge fan of pork flautas, but this came out as a gigantic thing that looked as if it were wrapped in some weird pastry batter. Didn't taste much better.

Looking for Mexican in Fountain Hills? Try something else.Slow service and way over priced. They didn't even use air freshener either. I will not be returning. It's unfortunate because the location is very convenient.I haven't been to Gameworks in about 5-6 years.  I remember the one in Michigan being a lot different.  I thought it was a pity when they closed but I think I see why after my visit here.  

Holy expensive!  I bought the deal on Groupon.  I thought a little over half off was a good deal!  $20 for a full day of games. (This is based on what we could play with the groupon) If I would have known that the place consisted of a high majority of extremely similar fighting games and racing games I would have probably passed.  Quite a few of the games either were broken or did not work at all.

The restaurant has good food. My better half was a little upset paid $9 for only 4 chicken fingers, but they were tasty nonetheless. 

I'm not impressed, they have nothing there that would convince me to go again.This place sucks.

Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.

It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.

First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.

We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.

The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? 

The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. 

So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.The employees were all very welcoming and acknowledging. The downside was communication amongst employees was awful! 

I had issues with an immediate entrance door not reading my room card, but it could open the door to the next level, although miniscule it was a huge inconvenience. I contacted engineering 3 times with no rersponse until the 3rd time when their was a card left in my room stating "the problem with: your AC has been resolved." There was nothing wrong with my AC!

Secondly, the woman answering the room calls was short and rude with a bad attitude.

And finally, I left a book in the room, I had to call 3 times to get a response whether housekeeping found the book. Once they did a young man called and wrote my information to send me the book. Two days later, I receive a phone call for shipping department asking me if they had the book, are you kidding me?!Went to this place for dinner after reading the reviews. Not what I am looking for as far as Chinese food is concerned for my taste.  Portions were decent but lacked taste.  Will not return as there are better places out there for me.Kohl's is like any other department store really.. the deals are great and the store is usually kept up. The only reason this review is receiving two stars is the lack of customer service I have received the past experience. 

I was there with my mom a week before Black Friday and found some boots that I liked, my mom as well liked the same pair. I grabbed size and was trying to find hers however they were not stocked so we locate a employee and my mom says "Excuse me, could you help me out?" Couple minutes go by the lady either A. didn't hear us B. ignored us or C. didn't understand what my mom was saying (complicated question i know) So again, my mom nicely asks the same employee, "Do you mind assisting me?" and the lady grunts and her! Yes, GRUNTS. I was taken back and tried myself. As I'm holding the boot showing it to her I said "Excuse me, I would like to find this boot in a size six, there are none on the floor" She looks up at me and waddles off to the display section, as she turns I say, "Ma'am the display is in my hand, the number you need is here." She keeps walking.... So i just wait for her to come back. She comes back and says "No size six:" I responded, "I understand that, what i'm asking is if you can check in back". So she goes and checks in back.. "No six".. Okay fine. My mom and I thank her and go over to the kiosk... Get all the way down the the check out section and tried to apply a coupon and the machine freezes so of course we find another employee to assist us and our luck again, a cranky old woman lets out a big sigh after we asked for help and says "I don't know how to work these things".... WHAT- you have a machine in your store you can't even function? AT ALL? So she stands there and pouts and watches myself figure the stupid machine and says "Yeah these break all the time".... WHAT... At this point steam is pushing out of my ears... IF your employees can't help your customers why are they there? Why hire old hags that get overwhelmed by doing their JOB? Mind boggling to me... needless to say we got the boots with the assistance of no one and went on our merry way.I consider just going to a different cox store. I know that their customer service on the phone is excellent. But whenever it comes time for me to pay the Cox bill, their bill paying machine is ALWAYS down. 

The seriously need another location in the north valley, because I'm always waiting atleast 20m to pay a bill. I go to United Beauty Supply two doors down while I wait. 

The staff can also be rude. I've had great experiences and horrible experiences. They're not really informative about anything. If you ask a question, they ask a counter question. Example: Yesterday I went to pay a bill, and I said, "Can you put me on the list, there are atleast 25 people here, I'm just going to run next door for a second." "Are you leaving?" STOP. ANSWERING. QUESTIONS. WITH QUESTIONS! He didn't give me an estimate after that. And it was honestly a 20m wait. There were people lined up outside of the store, that's how crowded it was, no joke!Ive seen better stocked Walmart in my time.... Ive been to this location a lot do to location and it seems as if i want something there always out of it.... anywhere from food to car parts... pretty annoying... staff is friendly though.... also there's no tire and lube place here but that's all rightOk, the first thing I am going to say is something positive...because I have been told to find the positive things in life...I focus too much on the negative.

Their cornbread was friggin amazing.

Whew, now I got that out of the way.  Now I can go on with my happy self and tell you why this place is lucky it is getting 2 stars  (and really it is only because my cousin had something nice to say also)

The story goes...I never experienced such horrible customer service in my life.  My cousin was in town from Michigan and loves the show "Drive-in's, Diners, and Dives" (is that the right order?)  and heard about this place so we just had to go.  (My grandparents mentions Bill Johnson's Big Apple, but I said I would just go home if they were going to go there.)  So Aaron and I ordered our entrees with a salad, and my grandfather order his entree with chili.  (Grandma doesn't eat much...)  Aaron also ordered fried dill pickles for an appetizer.  (Note: My grandma and I wanted a baked potato that on the menu said that are availabe after 5pm but the waitress said they wouldn't be ready until 5:30pm)  Aaron and I got our salads...and Aaron asked about the pickles..."Oh, they are cooking them now."  Ok...so then my grandpa asked for his chili, which should have came out with our salads, and the waitress replied "Listen, I have other tables that have orders also.".  Wow....I even replied, "Are you serious?" 

So besides that, I found the decor a little nauseating (how many pink pigs do I need to see and why are they seriously playing "Babe" on the TV?  Like I want to eat pork now)  The food was so so...cousin said that his ribs were cooked just right, but the sauce was too sweet to his liking.  Grandparents thought that their sandwiches were too big.  I thought that my mashed potatoes had a funky flavor too them.

So with the review of the ribs and their awesome cornbread (which I ordered a 2nd helping of) I give it 2 stars.  

Where oh where can I find some awesome barbeque????I've eaten here before, and it's never been great, but NEVER has it been this bad. 

The first thing I want to mention, is that I have very little tolerance for heat. As in, their regular salsa that comes with the chips is on the 'just-a-bit-to-warm' side.

Started the night with mini-chimis. These were OK texture wise, but a small dip into the sour cream obliterated all pretense of flavor.

My Grande Margarita arrived sans alcohol. I didn't order a virgin, but there was either no alcohol in it or so little that there was no sign of buzz on a 6 hour empty stomach.

I ordered the Carne Asada, which normally comes with salsa and hatch chilies. I asked for them to hold the hatch, however a few bites into it - when it finally came out -  the intense heat hit me. I rolled back the cheese on top to see a healthy serving of hatch underneath. Yeah, no. Half my virgin Grande Margarita later and the heat finally started to subside. To boot, the steak had been boiled and over cooked. When we informed the waiter, he was very apologetic and removed it from the bill.

My partner ordered the white sands chimichunga with a side of hatch. (yeah he's a heat nut) Since it's fried and smothered with sauce, it was fairly obvious that it had been sitting awhile given it's sogginess, lack of temp and the beginnings of film on the cheese.

My son's grilled cheese and fries were hot. (painfully hot actually)

The waiter was nice but food was poor and service was very slow, which is why I'm listing at 2 stars.

If you MUST have Arribas, spend the gas and head to the one in Scottsdale.I stayed at this Hotel on 10/8.  We checked in about 3am, after almost falling asleep at the wheel.  I was advised the cost of the room was $69 + taxes, but when we went to check out they had added on an additional $32. not advising me of the charges.  It wasnt until I looked at my bank statement did I see the charges.  While we slept someone broke into our truck and stole a very expensive printer and the clerk refused to look at the camera to see who it might of been that stole it.  I called the owner Mr Shamsher Singh and  he advised me I had signed for the extra charges one being the charge for having pets in the room. And also told me he wasnt responsible for the theift. At check in I was never advised of the charges nor was I asked if I had pets.  I feel its the responsiblity of the check in clerk to advise the customer of the charges before they sign the papers.We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.Paid $100 bucks for a one night stay.  The full sized beds were TINY.  Two grown people most definitely do NOT sleep or fit comfortably!!  Breakfast was decent. They offer waffles, cereal, juices & milk, some fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels or bread for toasting.   The pool was nice as well as the pool area itself.  The location is pretty centralized to a ton of restaurants, sports complex, and shopping.Have been going to the place since it opened in the 90's.  Over the past few years the service has really taken a dive at this location. 

It seems to me that this bad service is not the fault of the wait staff, but more the fault of whoever is managing this place.  The wait staff is always running around frantically trying to tend to all of their tables. It is apparent that the place is chronically understaffed or whatever workflow they have is not effective. 

If you do have the patience to through the process of getting the waiter's attention, and ordering drinks, and waiting for bread that is almost always "in the oven", waiting to order desert, and waiting for the check, the food isn't that bad.Not good at all  I got a grilled chicken burrito the chicken was so much fat I will not go backI've been to many Ulta's and this one was by far the worst I've ever been to. The place was so unorganized they didn't have many products that I was looking for and when I asked one of the employees she told me they had been out for a month and wasn't able to tell me when they would be getting new shipment in. The employee didn't seem to know where anything was either . They mostly were all chit chatting instead of helping customers. I definitely won't be going back to this Ulta.Attended the 15th anniversary and had a mixed experience.  How can you knock 15 cent beer, pizza and wings?  I can't, especially when the beer is pretty damned good.  Now the bad news...the service.  I was standing in line at the beer stand near the sports book.  I didn't mind waiting because they were fairly busy due to the cheap prices.  As I got to the front, I was second in line.  The guy behind me asked the guy pouring the beer a question and to my surprise the server asked him what he wanted and helped him.  The lady in front of me turned and said "I guess we wasted our time standing in line."  The other server, a blond lady finally helped us.  When it was my turn, I ordered 4 beers.  She told me that she could only give me 2.  That would be fine except that 2 out of the 3 people in front of me were served 3 each by her.  I only remember that because I was trying to figure out how to carry 4 and was watching how they carried their 3.  If the rule is 2 per customer, fine, but don't arbitrarily enforce the rules.  It made me feel discriminated against and irritated me the rest of the night.  I hadn't been in there for years but was enjoying my night.  In an instant, it turned and now I won't be back over something that could have been avoided.Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling.
Left that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated.
Wanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pmAs far as Chipotle overall goes, 2 of these stars go simply towards that.  Taste of food +1, service overall -1 (yes, it's that bad).  If this wasn't the closest one to my house I would definitely stop going.

They have screwed up my order more times than gotten it right -- and this is from ordering online, where they have a physical piece of paper directing them what to put into it.  Several times I've ordered online and come to the restaurant at the pick-up time given on the site and come to find out they haven't even MADE my order yet.  Not terrible since it's fresh but why bother putting a pick-up time?  They weren't even busy either.

I think this location just has a lot of lazy employees.  Food quality is still good in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants, but perhaps speaking slowly and clearly would be ideal when placing an order.

If ordering online, it's a mixed bag.  Sorry.First of all I love Chipotle. Eat there several times a week. This location however disappoints me. They are slow and rushed to make every order.

Today takes the cake. I should have paid attention to how they put my bowl in the bag because sideways equals a soaked bag  and car seat when I finally got home. The Las Vegas Boulevard location is way better.Where do I start. Well first off the receptionist at the front did not want to be there. She never gave me eye contact. In fact she continued to gossip with the people around her while blindly handing me things to fill out. Very cold. Next when I was finally called to the back, the lady was getting irritated at the fact I wanted to see the difference between 1 & 2. I mean common! Rude and cold again. I waited for the doctor to come in, he told me my prescription and when I asked how it was that my left eye was worse than my right when I could clearly see better out of me left he jumped around the question and left. It seemed as though he just wanted me out. At the checkout area, the woman spent the majority of the time on the phone with a friend and every time she looked up she remarked "she use to work here." I'm sitting there thinking to myself this is unbelievable. She's on the phone having a conversation while I'm waiting to be checked out. The staff was very unprofessional. The only good thing about the place was on lady who ran after me to give me a pair of contacts. She was more help in answering my questions than the doctor or any of the others in the back. She is the only reason they get 2 stars and not one.What a let down. This place looked promising when we arrived at 2am and there was still a wait.. 

Shrimp spring rolls: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9sd-x39edTuwg0Fvz3hZhw&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
Decent. The rice paper was fresh and super soft.. Dipping sauce was made with the right amount of peanut butter/hoisin sauce. Nothing amazing, but it was good.

Vermicelli with charbroiled chicken and egg rolls: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nzg_OREoJBP_6vMKY156AQ&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
I'm going to be honest.. This was probably one of the worst vermicelli dishes I've ever had (and I've had this dish at many restaurants). The chicken lacked flavor.. It didn't have that Vietnamese "charbroiled" taste. And more importantly, the fish sauce was bland!! It didn't taste right.. almost as if it was watered down or they didn't make it correctly. I ate 1/4th of the bowl and ended up wasting the rest of it.

My friends ordered the pho and porridge, and they also left more than half of their food because it just wasn't good. Maybe because we're spoiled with Viet food from Garden Grove? Who knows. Oh, and service here does not exist.. Typical for an Asian restaurant I guess. 

Note: The Yelp hours are wrong! They're open 24 hours.Food: 3 stars, service: 2 stars, price: 3 stars.

The food was decent. Compared to our izakaya & yakitori experiences, this was a disappointment. We tried most of recommended dishes: breaded calamari, breaded octopus, yellowtail tar tar, breaded quail eggs, braised pork belly, Kim Chi fried rice, beef tongue & chicken skewers, and miso black cod. We attempted to try their honey toast.
There were no real "wows" in our meal. The best dishes were the cod, tar tar, and Kim chi fried rice.

As for the service, I was very unhappy since the beginning. We mentioned to the host that we were in a hurry and trying to get our friends to the airport. He insisted it will only be a 10 wait minute. Well we waited 20min. Once seated, our dishes were dirty. Even though there were 4 of us, only 3 plates, bowls, waters were served. Then lastly, we ordered the "recommended" dessert, honey toast. But after 10 minutes, we were starting to think they forgot and upon inquiring, we realized that they didn't even put in the order and it was going to take another 10-15 minutes to finish. I'm sorry but did we say we were in a hurry. 

I like the idea of late dining options here, but I will definitely not be returning due to the poor service and mediocre dishes.Ate here the other weekend with family.  The atmosphere was nice.  Felt like oldtime Vegas and our server was good.  So, one star for that.
And one star for the Apple martini... the best part of my meal!
I ordered the veal parmesan and it was dry and a dinner salad that was swimming in dressing.  My bf order the ravioli and it was fried (what the heck?).   For the cost of this meal, I would rather have gone to the roulette wheel and bet all on green 0.The small restaurant was cute, the service was good not great the $5.00 breakfast was ok and the reason it was okay is because it hash brown were the pre packaged, pre cooked type (McDonald's hash-browns) yet our wait time was inexcusable because all that had to be cooked were the eggs. (You need to know that we were the only customers at the time that we ordered).  

The music at night sounded great, this is a place I will visit again because the hotel was great and the price was great.Ok, this store has a great selection of products.....however, the service here sucks, which is why I gave it 2 Stars.  I would have given it 1 Star but the selection of products bumped it up to 2 Stars.

Was shopping with my son for a pair of shoes and had to ask for assistance.  There were 3 people working within 10 feet of us and none of them came up to ask us if we needed any help.  Meanwhile, my son was trying on shoe after shoe.....he tried over 10 pairs of shoes and still no help from anyone.

We finally found a pair he liked and went to pay for it.  It was about 30 minutes until closing and there was a line of about 20 people and 4 cashiers.  When we got to the front of the line, I could hear one of the cashiers say really loud to another...."Damn, where the hell did all this customers come from?!  Don't they have better things to do?".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.

That comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!  Ungrateful.....she doesn't understand the value of a customer.

Based on her comments & the lack of customer service from the 3 lazy people who was near us and didn't offer help.....I've determined that it's not a one-off situation, but a regular problem with this store.  Clearly they don't know how to service customers.

I wish my son would have found something he wanted at the Adidas store....they were very friendly and helpful.

Will I return?  ~with a frustrated voice~ Only because there aren't more options for Nike Outlet Stores.....just the one on the South End of the Strip, which is inconvenient for me.First off let me state, I really wanted to give this place more stars, but try as I might, I just can't. 

The servings were plentiful, they skimp on nothing. The dishes were spicy, but not hot, just the way I like it. 

I'm thinking the cook had an off day. I'm hoping the cook had an off day. 

The place is really, really quiet. It almost feels deserted. And the fans cause this strobe affect that makes it difficult to focus, let alone read the menu. The server was very nice and friendly. Unfortunately he wasn't very well-versed with the ingredients and we spent time going back and forth from the table to the kitchen and back. It has a large, distracting TV as well. 

The Fried Spring Rolls we got were over cooked and appeared dark and tasted slightly burnt. The filling inside was overcooked and slightly greasy as well. Not off to a great start here. At least the weren't served at a scorching 250 Degrees like most places.

The Hung Ley we go with pork ( a nod to Dan on the suggestion ). It was not what I was expecting in a good sorta way and overly strong in a bad sorta way. I liked the deep, smokey flavors. But they came on a bit strong as the pork was a bit dry. But the sauce was complex in an earthy way that wasn't like mushrooms. We went a three and it was just right.

The Kang Pa ( Jungle Curry ) which was our mutually agreed upon favorite dish. Bright. Lemony. Spicy. The curry was delicious and accentuated the sharp crispness of the peppers, green beans, and other veggies very nicely. We are going to try this cold, as we think it could work well just as well. We got our spoons crossed. We went a three and it tasted like it was spiced twice as much. Careful, this is a naturally spicy dish to begin with.

Drunken Noodles do not do well if they are slightly burnt. This dish suffered all way round because of this. It tasted as if it could have been so much better if it just wasn't slightly burnt. This was ordered at a four.. But this time it could have used a six, at least.

So, true to my curmudgeonly ways, I have to lay it out and sock it to 'em. Not my favorite Thai place by far. I may give another chance here because I taste promise, but two is all you get.I came here a week ago and bought a banana cream pie. When I got home and cut up the pie, I discovered that it was a lemon pie disguised as a banana pie!  I came back today to buy a real banana pie and also let the manager know what happened. He did nothing about it. I'm annoyed and done with this place. There are too many good places with great customer service to be putting up with this bull. Had he apologized, I wouldn't be ranting like this. But to tell me they look a lot alike and expect me to accept that? No thanks. See ya, Marie! This replacement I purchased better be the real deal.Olive Garden "jumped the shark" years ago.  They are a drain on the income of the company that owns them because they can't justify the prices they charge, thus less people are going in year after year.  The food is bland and overpriced, example, $13.00 for spaghetti and meatballs, $16 for lasagna????  Your food better be damn good at those prices, and Olive Garden is not even close.  There are so many restaurants that have better food and lower prices in Vegas that it's just a matter of time before Olive Garden is no more....one caveat:   the servers are really good, they try their best to do everything right, I can't fault them for the company's food and pricing problems.**Review only on the Horchatta***

Came here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station. 

We went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.

My horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good.I have to start off by saying this restaurant is visually very appealing, but when the food arrives it's like finding out Santa is not real- every time. Seriously, the salsa was so watered down I bet a baby could drink it out of a bottle and not flinch. Super Mex, I want to love you. Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried:
Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish.
Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa!
Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies
Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex
Overall, what is a Mexican restaurant without a decent salsa and guacamole? Simply not a fan, amigo.Talk about bait and switch. Ads said prime rib dinner $9.99, steak and lobster dinner $11.99, steak and sea food dinner $13.99, etc. So we show up ask for the prime rib dinner, no prime rib dinner here, it's at the buffet... Strike one.  Ok steak and lobster dinner $11.99 ... It's not available until 8pm. Strike two.  Ok, steak and sea food dinner $13.99 ...  We'll that's part of the early bird special.. It's 6 pm - strike three -your out!  No early bird, no late bird, no prime rib. We end up having the queen cut prime rib and the chef's special, orange roughy. This included a soup/salad and bread.  Overall the prime rib was ok a bit over cooked. The roughy was good, although the orange flavor was a bit much after awhile. Bottom line: food was ok but the price was a bit much for what we received. Hoping for the special and getting an overprice meal doesn't give you a good taste in the overall experience.We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on.  We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit.

Drinks:  The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come.  This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this.  


Food:  We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as "dip-py" as I was expecting -- I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes.  I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints.  My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy/crispy, but more soggy.  Very disappointing.

Overall Service: Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow -- timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow.  Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster.  The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great.  My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas.

We would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars.  The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off-strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.I used to love this place a lot. They're a bit on the expensive side, but the pizza was great. Not NY pizza great, but great for what it was. I picked up a pie on Tuesday (6/2/09) and it was devoid of flavor. Not the first time this happened. What makes a pizza place great in my opinion is consistency. I've dined in a few times and the staff seemed annoyed and came off as rude.
I'm officially done with Northside Nathans.We have brought our previous dog there and we had a good experience, the vet that took care of him was thorough of what was going on with our dog. The next pet we brought there didnt seem like she cared. When it came to talk about the bill she seemed more interested in that. When they called us that our dog will be discharged that day, the vet wasnt even there to talk about his aftercare on how we should take care of him at home. Anyway, we took him home and the next morning he passed. We have paid alot of money to them but they have not gave good treatment to our boy. I felt that the vet who so-called took care of our pet, took advantage of us.This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst. 

The service tends to be on the rude side these days. 

They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8. 

There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee. 

There is no such thing as half n half here. 

It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you. 

It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready. 

There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs. 

Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient? 

The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.  

These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10.Today is the final straw. First I would like to add, I love working out and finding a decent, convenient location to work out at is a plus in my book. That is the only reason why I go to this location. Furthermore, I would like to say, that the staff not all, but mostly, is very fucking rude. The reason why I say (that actually two people), is rude, is because I shouldn't have to put a lot of energy into actually acknowledging my presence. "Such as saying hello". 

 I'm not the type of person that really feeds into negative people's energy normally but when you're having a bad day and someone is working in customer service, the last thing you expect is bad customer service in a customer service field. 

 One in particular, this "girl", not a grown woman, always has an attitude.  A few months ago, I actually engaged into making a conversation with her. Just so I knew, that maybe it wasn't me that she always had an attitude with or thinking it it was something that I did to her. And even then, she acted like she had an attitude, like she didn't want to be bothered. Her excuse was as I was being cordial with her, "are you having a bad day" and in response "I'm just a little tired". So I said to myself, okay just let it roll off. 

  But then everyday after that the same cold nonresponsive attitude. She doesn't even say hello at all she looks the other way or looks down. Then I started noticing some others that she worked with acting the same way. (As if they had a little click against me.) 

  Like I said before I'm a very laid-back, and I just kind of keep to myself. So I don't understand what's going on at this location. So if anybody experiences the same thing, please let me know. I don't like taking things personal but it's a shame that I have to go to a different location where people actually have common decency and respect for each other at a different location. 

I gave this two stars because, a person can really make or break the environment with their attitude and energy. The place can be in immaculate shape and clean and all that. Which this place isn't always clean and decent and I pretty much ignore it. But the energy here, always weighs me down at this place. Then you start noticing when people, like to shit literally, in the showers and other things that isn't wiped down properly, etc.

So there you go. My epic review and all truth. Good luck to all.It's actually very hard to review this hospital fairly with one rating because one aspect of the visit was HORRIBLE and the other aspect of the visit was the total opposite. I am basing my star rating on my ER experience because I'm guessing that is more of what people would check reviews for.

The ER situation is atrocious. I've been in the hospital a LOT in my lifetime (unfortunately). I've lived in several states, experienced ERs in both private and public hospitals and I have NEVER had a wait as long as I did here. There was zero privacy for triage, there were absolutely not enough seats in the waiting areas and they had people who had been seen brought back out to continue waiting (I'm assuming for test results?) in the waiting room - some in hospital gowns, others in wheelchairs... who wants to be sitting half naked in a freezing waiting room??? I was in the waiting room for over three hours. At NO point in that time did anyone make an attempt to come out and perhaps look at disinfecting/cleaning after patients who had come and gone. I was not in with any time of infectious or contagious disease but there were people coughing, both adults and children vomiting into plastic bags all over the waiting room... who wants to sit in those seats after that?? The whole process is frustrating. You stand around waiting for someone to take your name. Then you wait to see triage. Then you wait SOME MORE to see someone in registration. Then - you guessed it - more waiting to see a doctor finally. 

Once I DID finally get into the actual ER, I was kept overnight and every single nurse and doctor I interacted with other than one was extremely kind and caring. The one nurse who was the exception seemed to hate his life - I could hear him complaining about the staff, the hospital, all of it, from my room. But everyone else was truly a blessing who made a horrible situation for me much more comfortable and I felt they really did care. 

Overall the medical staff at the hospital was fantastic. But if I ever had to go to the ER again, I highly doubt I would return here.Are you serious?  Hooters sold enough hot wings to open a Hotel/ Casino/ Hooters?  Well, they hired enough *ahem* talent  to pawn off their mediocre wings across the country.  Gotta admit though that they have some hot waitresses here.  Food still sucks.  Might as well enjoy the view while I choke down the food.So, a Hooter's in Las Vegas would be really over the top, right?  The Nexus of Sin meets The Strip Mall Equivalent, should be antimatter versus matter in a no-hold's-barred test of tits, right?

Boring, incompetent staff, stupid wait for a seat at the bar... but A-plus on tolerance and good-humor.  They dealt with a real winner at one end of the bar who, in Jersey, gets thrown out with a smack upside the head.  It's nice to see people being nice to stupid animals.

The burger was good, actually not a bad place for cheaper eating options but I'd be inclined to skip it, and it ranks low against other incarnations of the franchise.

-CBad #1 Check-in.  had no idea how to enter our reservations in computer,  so we could get our vouchers for free breakfast and so we never got it.   #2 Dirty halls and unmaintained guest rooms. #3 Different drink prices thru same hotel all run by hooters. #4 No free internet. #5 One pool is ice cold. #6 Does not follow up on complaints. #7 No one wins at slot machines. #8 Ghetto towels for pool so you don't steal them. #9. Parking garage is just filthy. #10.  There is no manager it just runs itself!

Good #1 Security.  #2 Price of room when on special. # 3 Good music outside at the one heated pool. #4 Lots of Hooter girls #5 Onion restaurant specials and service  Note: Will probably never go back. Worth the extra money to go elsewhere.As mentioned before, the girls who work here are overwhelmed.slow service, drinks kinda crappy.food was ok and tables are run down and shoddy.Tasty pizza, but hardly supreme.

We ordered a 12 inch thick crust double bacon cheeseburger pizza, and paid about $15. The crust was thick, soft and tasty, but the sauce seemed to be straight tomato paste with no seasonings aside from an excessive amount of oregano. They were stingy on the meat, to the point that we had to hunt for the bacon and even the hamburger seemed overwhelmed by the flavors of oregano and pickles (yes, they put pickles on their cheeseburger pizza).

I enjoyed the food, but there are a lot of pizza places in Madison, and you can get better food for less at most of them.Great location and staff, average to below average rooms. I think it was clean?Walk-in humidor was well-stocked though I did not detect the familiar "closeness" that a humidor's humidifier creates. A broad selection of top brands was available. Prices ranged from about $5 a stick (for low-end brands) to about $18/stick for top of the line stuff. The median price range was about $7 to $10. The staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful. I would probably only resort to this shop on a "plan B" basis.There is only one reason to bother coming to Chin's: the cream cheese puffs.

If you get anything else, you're wasting your money. I'm not saying this because "It's not authentic Asian!"--I'm saying this because the flavors are generally bland, the food is generally overcooked (or has been every time I've been here), and the food tastes real bland and repetitive after the third bite.

Otherwise, as others have mentioned, you can get better American-Chinese elsewhere and for cheaper. But if you want the real-deal kind of Asian food, Fugu is the one. Normally, I wouldn't suggest going to other places, but Chin's is such a rip-off compared to other places.

However, I will say this: Chin's has a very neat ambiance and the setting itself is much nicer than any of the other Asian food places on or near State St.Based on the food alone, this place would be 4 stars based on what we had today.
We were in town over the weekend, and breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  My boyfriend googled and this place popped up on the Madison Better Breakfast Bureau (what a fantastic idea, by the way) -  so based on the ratings on that site and yelp, I was SUPER excited to eat there.
So why such a low rating?  I really hated the set up.  It was this morning (Sunday) so I knew it was going to be crowded.  I thought it would be like a normal restaurant where you go, wait an excruciating amount of time for a table, and then sit down and have some time to look over the menu, decide what to get, and order.  No. That is not how it works... I felt very rushed the entire time I was there.  I felt as though I had 25 seconds to look at the menu.  Order, get a number and sit at a table and wait for the food.
The coffee is self serve (which is not the part that is the problem) but is  in such an inconveniently located place directly next the to the cash register that it is super crowded, you can't get refills because the crazy line is ALWAYS in front of it.  And I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $2.25 for a "bottomless" cup of coffee, that means I want a refill.  And I was under the impression the term "bottomless" stems from a waitress coming over and refilling your cup before you see the bottom... Anyway - no way to get refills of your coffee... Moving on - 
I was also sitting at a table directly near the coffee station, and where the food comes up from the kitchen (and also located directly next to the seats where people who have already ordered and are waiting for tables are sitting).  My chair was bumped no less than 30 times by people walking back and forth (staff and customers alike).  
Now - about the people waiting for tables - I am eating my breakfast.  I do NOT want you staring down at me because you have already ordered and are waiting for your food.  It makes me feel uncomfortable, and made me eat faster, and not really enjoy my meal.   That is not their fault, but rather the fault of the set up of the restaurant.  Perhaps you should not have people order food before they definitely have a table.  
Overall, it was just very odd.  I would definitely not return based on the set up..  The food was great (Ham and Gruyere Omelet for me, Chorizo scrambler for boyfriend).Was looking forward to celebrating a new job with dinner here.
The food was great but the service was awful. We waited over ten minutes just for our waiter to come to the table. He didn't introduce himself or offer anything (drink/menu specials, etc) but he did make an excuse that it was really busy (on a Tuesday with four empty tables around us). He took our orders and said he'd be back with bread. He took another ten minutes to bring bread and drinks. When we were done eating, he came by to see if we needed a box. When he brought back the check, he left it on the table and ignored us for 20 minutes. We tried flagging him, telling him we were ready  and I finally had to stand up to stop him from ignoring our table again. We watched and listened as he talked to the elderly couple behind us, offering up the specials and explaining dishes to them. He literally ignored our attempts to stop him and several times turned and walked away! 
Really disappointing.I learned about Bluephies from a food blog I frequent that is written by a Madison resident. She gave it such good reviews, and after looking at their website I was sold!

I came here on a double date with my boyfriend and another couple and we were seated right away. Service was a little slow, but we were having a great time so it didn't matter. I ordered a black bean burger and was super excited to try the specialty tater tots. I paid an extra fee to get them and they arrive and there is....4 freaking tots on a plate?! I could have had fries for no extra charge, but 4 FLIPPING tots are going to cost extra?! I was incredibly disappointed. 

Dessert saved the meal for me. My boyfriend and I ordered choc chip cookie dough egg rolls and the other couple had cheesecake and both were divine!

I would for sure come back for dessert, but dinner was way too expensive to leave me wanting so much more.It's a standard Super 8 two star. Clean enough, nothing fancy, and some funny smells here and there. Sirens outside throughout the night. The night clerk said a few things that didn't make sense and were confusing. The thin door to the next room let me hear the dude coughing all night. These are all pretty standard for this type of hotel, but all together I'd probably consider staying somewhere else if I had to stay another night.This location is ok, I have been going to this location for a few years and I loved the pizza so much; however, the quality of the pizza has changed drastically, the dough it's so bland, you can't even taste the tomato sauce and in general the pizza it's very soggy, I don't know what happened. Their salad bar could be so good if the manager would put attention to what their employees are doing, I have seen many times when they refill the veggies just by putting them on top, they don't even bother in flipping out the container and put at least the new veggies at the bottom and the old ones on top. Somebody can get sick easily by this poor food management. I used to go to this location twice a week and now maybe once every three months and just because deep in my heart I have the hope somebody noticed what is happening there, but I really doubt it. Besides, the walls are so dirty all the time, my God I can't believe parents bring their children to this place. If you stop by, at least check the place carefully so that u can judge if it is a safe place to eat with your children.Minimal bagel selection on a Sunday morning was disappointing.Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing. The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too. Save your money and drive 5 minutes to the mineral point location.I was not thrilled with this gym.  At the Fitchburg location, there is plenty of equipment, and the little TVs are a treat.  It is clean.  My biggest complaint is the trainers, who spent more time chatting with me than helping me develop a routine I'd actually do.  At first I was really excited about the group classes, but then I realized the instructors don't make corrections, which is not only disappointing, but can be dangerous.  I'd recommend taking full advantage of the 14 day trial period, as the fees end up being quite costly if you aren't going to use the gym.HOLY CRAP!!!
OK, now before I get into a pissing match with anyone I just have to say this, the place is ridiculously expensive. 
I don't get why you have to spend almost $200 on 1 pair of jeans? I mean come on!! I guess I would expect this from a store like this, but it's mostly all graphic t-shirts and pants..I do like the style..but I mean everything in there is graphic-ified. haha.
I did purchase a purse from there that I still wear today, but they are cheaply made. The lining of the purse tore open for some odd reason, I'm not ruff with my pruses and don't keep knives in there..all the time.. ;)~
I do know they have a sale rack in the back that is unmarked which I found odd..basically you have to read the tag to find out how much your paying..it's always a good hunt! 
I'd say go in, look around, but don't waste your money on their clothes. Or purses. You can find better quality. ;)~Used to go here for sushi all the time. Good food, decent prices. We stopped going because the wait staff was always very rude to us... we were good, frequent customers, so I don't know what was up. We go to Takara now... just down the street and they're awesome.It was fine for the area when you're in town for work and need a place close to the hotel/mall. However, I would not recommend.Ordered chicken wings (small) & a Garden salad, took them over an hr & 10 minutes to deliver. Then when the delivery guy carelessly handed me the food, it almost fell to the floor & he expected a tip. The food was ok, not worth the wait. Would not recommend this place.I stayed here for Phoenix Comicon 2013.  You expect a bit of noise during an event of that kind, but the level of noise I could hear in my room from the open atrium was astounding. 

The hotel and rooms look like they're in need of renovation.  

Internet access/WiFi was prohibitively expensive.  I got free Internet last month at Motel 6 !    

The only + was the proximity to the convention center.Stayed here for a night for a convention. For that the location couldn't be better. The bed was comfortable too. That's why I gave a second star. I reserved two nights but left a day early to spend Father's Day with my newborn son and they refused to refund the second day even though I checked out before 10am. They have no parking and will not validate so guests pay $12 per day. If you take the little $5 Aquafina bottle in the room, walk to a 7-11 later and buy one for $1 and replace it in the room before checkout. Don't even bother with the pool or hot tub here. There is no free Wi-Fi. That will cost you another $10 per day or $15 if you want premium. Was glad to check out. Not what I expected from Hyatt. Nothing against the nice ladies at the desk, but I was much more welcome when I got home! :)I have read a few reviews here and some rate this place pretty high despite their feedback on this place.  This place is probably one of the only Irish hell holes in Phoenix that resemble those nasty pubs from the ghettos back east.  Dark inside with unfriendly asshole bartenders, and the waitresses seem to run like chickens with there heads cut off when ever your in for lunch or a concert night at the dodge.

The food is definitely not a love maker, I can only imagine the old cookers and fryers that produce a less than average fish and chips and stale Fries.. UUURGGHH
 
Only reason they get two stars? There are cool bike guys that will shuttle  you to the dodge for a concert.

Stay Classy!Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. 

First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. "Oh it is the best soul food", "They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere.." are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are "cool" or trendy. 

Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.I like the six pool tables in the back of the room. You probably won't have to wait if you wanna play! Yes, the jukebox is legit as well...it's got a lot of the more underground, independent rock and rap. And the sound system does every track justice. 

Drink prices are meh...for a grimy place with more rugged patrons, I'm used to seeing a bit lower. Draft beer selection is less appealing than I'm used to in this neck of the woods. Having one unique brew just doesn't cut it these days! 

Another weird thing about the layout is that there's not really a place to sit besides the bar or next to the billiards. A lack of tables to socialize with your friends tells me it might not be THE best place for groups, since you'll all just stand around awkwardly. Maybe it deserves another chance during peak hours. Maybe I'm just missing something really cool about this place. For now, it doesn't seem to do anything better than other bars in the area, and that really lowers the return factor for me.California has much better vermicelli. The fish oil had no flavor. The grilled pork wasn't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good.Stopped in here for a 2-Piece Meal for lunch today & specified FOR HERE when the cashier gal asked me.  Soon, a guy appeared from the back with my meal packaged TO GO.  I nicely reminded him that it was for here, & he shoved a tray at me with a big serving of attitude!     :-O

Went to wash my hands & there were no paper towels in the bathroom, & not even one of those air blowers!     :-O

CHURCH'S CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THIS!!     :-((Mcdonalds is obviously the most generic hamburger place. It is also the most succesfull despite being one of the worst. Outside of the beloved french fries, what does good ole Mcds have going for it? Carls Jr beat their $1 drink with one for 69 cents. The new wings are horrible. Yes they are bigger then the kind you get elsewhere, but not the right kind of spicy and too expensive. The "special sauce" always brings down the burgers which arent that good to begin with. Now that Mcdonalds is planning on eliminating the dollar menu and replacing it with a $5 menu, maybe its time to try the Sonic up the street.The last three times I've been here, the service has been horrible. The wait staff is slow and not very friendly. We were done with our appetizer before anyone even came to get our food order. I ordered my steak medium well and it came out medium rare and cold. It took me 15 minutes to get the attention of the bartender (sat up at the bar) and then another 15 to bring my re - grilled steak back, meanwhile my date had finished his steak (which was also undercooked but he didn't say anything). The manager brought the steak back, offering no apology. After we left we realized we didn't get offered the bread selection that comes with the meal, let alone any kind of bread. The time before that, our "reservation" was over an hour late in being seated on a random Tuesday night, but at least we were given a bottle of wine for the table of 10.   Won't be back any time soon!This review is kind of late at being posted.  I have a handful of friends that come here often so come near years eve this is exactly where they wanted to go.  They always have the best stories about all the fun they had when they came here so I jumped on that bandwagon to go there for new years eve.  Specially when I found out that there was no door fee, or maybe it was no door fee before a certain time.  Either way I didn't pay to get in there.

The place was shockingly huge, I didn't realize how big it would be, how many pool tables and other games there would be.  I loved that there was plenty of space where you wouldn't have to wait around forever for a table.

But bummer, the place was also dead.  We sat around there for well over an hour waiting for it to pick up and when it didn't we opted to just go back to my friends house for new years night.  Maybe it was busy after we left, I wouldn't know because it was pretty dead the one time I went there.

Didn't really seem like my kind of place but I know 6 other people that love it here so I'm just one of the few that wasn't into it.I was going to give this place three stars and then realized there really isn't any reason to.  While it is cheap ($6 the night we went, with free nachos and soda), in this case you get what you pay for.

The rink surface was nice, but the roller skates were crappy, and the back of the place smelled like urine.  There is also no air-conditioning, just fans.

If you really want to go skating and are looking for an adventure, give it a shot.  If you're looking for a classy date spot, keep looking.Went here for dinner last night. Won't be back for quite awhile. Our server was a young female who knew nothing about the menu or customer service! I ordered the prime rib , medium and it came well done. Cold potato, the cheese wouldn't even melt. Husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done. Yuck! We ordered Chili instead of salad, when it didn't come out we asked the waitress and she said she brings it out with the meal... Usually it's brought out when the salads are brought out, so she went and got them. Seconds late here came our dinner with more chili...she asked of we wanted it, we told her no, then she went to the table behind us and asked if they wanted it. She told them not to tell anyone she did that and then came back and took the chili from our table and gave it to them.  Needless to say our food was not up to par, not was our service or experience!Came here after work to get my car repaired.

I told the mechanic my driver side axle was broken. he told me the axle was fine and said he could do a diagnostic for 50 bucks, but that would come off the cost of the axle.

he drove around for 15 minutes and with the help of another mechanic.. diagnosed that it was, in fact, my axle. Quoted me 300 for a Nissan Murano axle. I told him brakes plus did it for 200 (read my review on brakes plus for my experience after this one), he didn't believe me,  saying that he had the best prices in town and he would match Brakes Plus. We called up Brakes Plus on speaker- and they quoted me 200. he was angry, lied and said he couldn't do it for 200 any more. He wanted the diagnostic money, but I told him they had incorrectly told me it wasn't my axle when I walked in, so he shouldn't charge me up front. He was cool with that, so I drove off.The return policy here is ridiculous. I bought a blower/vacuum for $89.99, I got it home and a couple weeks later attempted to use it. Hats off and high fives to you men that work these machines like pros. I couldn't seem to get the leaves to blow in a pile, I just blew them all over the place. I saved my receipt, and next time I went to Lowe's I tried to return it. No go. The policy states you can't return power equipment after 30 days. Even if it is in perfect condition (manual original packaging ect.) and you have the receipt. So now I am stuck with a blower/vacuum I spent over 90 bucks on and can't use. And the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending. I wanted to smash her in the face with the box. At least then I'd get some bang for the 90 bucks. Lucky for her I completed my anger management classes...The service part person was rude and had a bad attitude.  We will go to the Internet for parts next time rather than making the drive. The two stars was for the nice selection of things in the store.They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up nowFood wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here.This is a review of the golf course...

Do not know what has happened to this historic course, but the condition was horrible....AND this is high season (course conditions are at their best due to great weather).  The grass on the sixth green was spotty at best - the course filled in the dead grass with sand??  Not contusive to an 'ok' putting surface.  The sand bunkers were packed in so much that it was basically hitting off dirt.  Bunker shots had to be played as chip shots off hardpan.  

Sad to see this course in this poor condition!  I enjoy the layout, the people and challenge, but the condition has declined over the years.  I hope the owners are able to put some money into the course to bring it back to its hay-day.  As of today, I suggest you seek other courses at comparable prices (i.e. Bear Creek, Ken McDonald, Dobson Ranch, Oakwood).They charged me $165 per night, the room was not clean, but the it was quiet and next to a golf course. However the staff specially one lady at reception was absolutely incompetent, she messed up even getting us a ride to chandler airport and we ended up paying $20 for a ride that should have been free, beside putting up with the aggravated driver. 

Be cautious of the staff since they really are not trained and do not know what they are doing. the breakfast is also horriblePossibly closer to 1.

My family has eaten here for as long as they've been in business.  Mostly I really like the place.  I can remember having macha and eggs and coming no where close to finishing it.

But I'm afraid those days have passed.

The last two times we've been there have been exercises in mediocrity.  

We order biscuits and gravy with bacon and 2 eggs (over easy, not over medium, not over hard. OVER EASY DO I REALLY NEED TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO IT???!!!

Ok the good news.  For me, as long as you don't burn it, you cant screw up bacon.

Biscuits and gravy.  Well first it's not a biscuit.  It a cake like device.  This is not to say it's bad, rather it's to say it's not a biscuit in the traditional sense.  Gravy comes out cool to warm....but never hot.

Ok onto the egg.  I want it over easy.  That means if any of the yolk is hard, it is not over easy.  This shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp.  I when you flip the egg onto the plate and you see hardness in the yolk, don't sent it out unless someone asked for a n over medium egg.   I ASKED FOR OVER EASY THIS IS NOT HARD TO DO!!! WHY DO YOU INSIST ON SENDING ME AN OVERCOOKED EGG??  I GAVE YOU AN EASY TASK I WANTED TO CHALLENGE YOU I WOULD HAVE ORDERED MY EGGS SCRAMBLED BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE SCREWED IT UP OUT OF HAND.  BUT NO I ASKED FOR OVER EASY...COOK THE WHtIE ON THE FIRST SIDE, FLIP THE EGG 20-30 SECONDS IT'S DONE.  WAS THAT HARD??? THEN WHY AM I SENDING MY EGGS BACK????  ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!The food was pretty good, but the service is horrible, and VERY VERY VERY VERY SLOW!!!!!!!I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry.I went here because I had a discount coupon from one of those daily special type sites. Everyone there was pleasant, the decor was nice. That being said, my brows were shaped very square and pointy, not really a normal shape, and to top it off the wax er left me with a long red abrasion on one of my eyes that lasted for over a week. I won't be going back.I am a big fan of Eggs Benedict and when I saw the pictures online (not how it looks in person anymore)  and read the menu I thought I had found a new favorite.  Not the case. The muffin was soggy (even though I asked it to be more toasted) They changed out the ham for prosciutto which made it way to salty.  There was very little Hollandaise sauce.  My server didn't really seem to care about my experience either.  On the bright side the monkey pancake was awesome. 

Maybe next time I will just focus on the pancakes, french toast, or eggs and hope to have a better experience.  The monkey pancake was good enough to get me to come back and try the bananas foster french toast.Really?

$5.95 for a one scoop sundae?  Yes!

Me: Excuse me, this should have whipped cream and a cherry.

Them:  Sorry, our whipped cream machine is broken.  Would you like a cherry?

Me (thought):  1. Tell me up front.   2.  Send someone to the store to buy Rediwhip!

$5.95?  Really?  Are we in Los Angeles at these prices?I started doing Bikram yoga in 2004, but I have never been one of those fanatics who goes everyday, or even every other day.  I prefer once, maybe twice a week, & this is mainly due to the cost of classes & my very busy (often spontaneous) lifestyle.  I would also like to add that Bikram yoga is not my only form of exercise, however it is my favorite.  So with all of this being said, I am a firm believer that when someone buys a package, whether it be 5 classes, 10 classes, or 25 classes, the paying customer should be able to choose when they use their classes.  This studio places a 6 week expiration date on their 10 class package, which is ridiculous.  All it is is a way for the studio to make more money.  People should be able to practice yoga when they choose & on their own schedules.  Not everyone's lives revolve around going to yoga everyday.  If yours does, good for you; if yours doesn't, this probably isn't the studio for you.

On another note, this studio is very nice & very clean, & most of the instructors are fabulous.not for picky eaters! im one, ill admit.

everybody seems to love this place but i cant figure out why. we went with another couple who raved about it. i wasnt impressed with the menu -- it was certainly interesting and different, but nothing amazing.

it was okay, but i probably wont go back unless a group is going and i dont have a choice. i dont what all the fuss is about.I went here for lunch disregarding the not so great reviews. When you first get there it's pretty abandoned looking, but once walking inside I was surprised by how many people were there. I thought, "GREAT! the reviews are wrong."

I ordered a las vegas roll and a teriyaki salmon. When I opened my box that help my roll...I was disapointed. The roll was very pale which normally indicates that it wasn't cooked long enough. I still gave it a try, and I could tase the doughy batter. Once I peeled off the outside of the roll I was left with cream cheese, salmon, and rice. The rice wasn't very good either...After about the third "piece" I gave up after my stomach started to hurt. I would not recommend this roll, I would much rather go to RA and spend about the same amount of money on their sushi. 

I haven't eaten the salmon, but from what I was seeing that and the chicken are very popular...Here's hoping when I'm feeling better, they will get an updated review.This place has seen better days. Wildly inconsistent service and food quality. Stick with the lettuce wraps and chicken soup as only viable options. Kid city.ummmm...ummm...There is a Captain Morgan statue in the back. 

That is about all I got! Drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much.A Rogers Park girl finds herself in Scottsdale AZ and where does she go?  Don & Charlies of course!  Wow, how exciting to walk into a place that models itself after places I grew up with.  The ambiance is second to none - the Chicago sports memorabilia is worth millions.  Totally what I had hoped.

Sadly, we caught Don & Charlies at the worst possible time ever.  Our reservation apparently happened just moments after the ASU football team showed up.  It was by far the worst service I have experienced in a long time.  One of my kids fell asleep waiting for his mac and cheese.  And I couldn't get a drink to save my life.  We sent back two of seven meals - and we are not the fussy food type. 

I would give this restaurant a single star (because I am a sucker for Chicago memorabilia), but, I give it a second star because the manager was amazing - taking care of us even better than I could have hoped.  He was obviously embarrassed and apologetic.

I will try it again and hope the other reviewers got it right.   But, couldn't justify more than a couple of stars for tonight's dinner (I didn't eat).We were headed out of town and looking to get a great dinner before hitting the road. Grimaldi's and Bandera both had an hour wait so we decided to stop into RA. They had no wait (now I know why). Their sushi was mediocre.. at best, and quite pricey. It didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked, and the flavors didn't seem to stand out as much as they should have. The miso soup was my favorite part of the meal. I will not be back to this location. I like the one in Vegas for happy hour, but I'll pass on the food.We have been back in the Scottsdale area for the last month and have probably visited  Rancho Pinot three or four times with generally good results. Our last visit however left quite a bit to be desired. Things got off ok with our server until we ordered a cocktail and appetizer prior to placing our dinner order. We mentioned that we would need just a little time to select our dinner order. Well, that was the kiss of death. Our server disappeared from the face of the earth never to be seen for several decades. We subsequently ordered dinner and it was just fine but the evening was somewhat ruined by dreadfully poor service and lack of customer attention.

As their menu states, "should you have a problem please mention it to us before yelp".
Well we did but our waiter's response was "couldn't get to you as I was too busy getting drinks for other tables" . Brilliant.Beautiful rooms and views. Room service is awful. The tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt I had to send it back. The room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve, such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.This would be our 3rd time visiting Cove Trattoria.  The first 2 were exceptional.  Both times we went on a Friday night, so one would expect it to be busy - it was not.  Service was fine, food was great.  This is why we went for a 3rd time.  

Big mistake.  We went last Thursday and it was quite busy, but there were several tables available.  We were asked if we had a reservation of which we did not being that the last 2 times, it was empty.  We were told that the 2 tops around the bar were not open seating (which must have changed because they were before).  So, we waited for 10 minutes or so only to be seated with the menus to have to wait 10 minutes for a drink order.  Worst part is two "regulars" came in, sat themselves at the same 2-tops we were sitting at and got prompt attention.  Still no waitress at our table.  When we finally did get a waitress, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and weren't lucky enough to get the same bread our neighbors got.  Again, after ordering our food, we waited approx. 30 minutes to receive it!  Luckily our food was fine and we didn't need anything because our waitress never bothered to check on us.  

I am positive the regulars get great service based on what I witnessed, but looking at all the other sad folks around the restaurant, their experience was similar to ours.  

Good thing we had a Groupon to use because I would've been even more upset had we paid full price for the so-so food and horrible service.This is the first time at this location and while the food was great the service is horrible. Our waitress was forgetful and took forever. It wasn't busy at all. Also the music is so loud that you can't hold a conversation with the person next to you. 

The food was great and came out quick. If you just want the food, then this is the place. If you want great service, go someplace else.Cheba Hut is a place I love and hate. I love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they're toasted! They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks, and a variety of tasty desserts. I hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit. The weed theme is amusing, but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has. Numerous times I have had rude, stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like I'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world, which is bullshit. I know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this; tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time, and to bring their A-game to work!The pizza tastes okay. It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, and their prices are average. It's not much for "New York" style pizza. Their large pizza is HUGE, but their crust is flavorless. Their wings are okay, but not great either. 

Their delivery times are off. Sometimes they'll tell you 45 minutes and they'll be an hour, or they'll be 10 minutes early. It's weird. Sometimes they just wont answer their phone. Sometimes they wont tell you when they'll be there. Once, they actually forgot part of my order. In terms of customer service, they're less than stellar... for sure.

Why do I keep eating there? My boss wouldn't eat anything else! I think if I have another Gus's pizza, i'll yack! I would recommend Pizza Hut over Gus's... any day.Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?

I tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced.
I'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.

In terms of service, one waiter was really nice but we were passed around to different waiters and I can't say that the others were helpful at all.

My recommendation would be - don't eat here.While in Tempe for the 2011 SLUTWALK TEMPE, I Yelped and found Monti's. It was close to the start of the Walk plus it's an historic building, the oldest in the area, belonging to the famous Hayden family. That's always fun to make such a discovery.
The service was fine and our server was nice and the ambience was delightful. Lots of historic photos and artifacts on the walls.
The food: This is the reason for the low rating. Mainly due to my partner's ordering of a fish and chips dish. To quote: "The fish tasted like it came right off the deck of the boat." She could not eat it. The fries had a peculiar taste also and were left uneaten. Throw in the fact that it was a rather expensive dish, let's just say, this was not a happy lunch hour.
My BLT with onion rings was quite good. I have no complaints.

In retrospect, I wish one of us had spoken to our server about the terrible food. Somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish.

Based on this experience and the fact that along Mill Ave. there are some fabulous-looking eateries, I doubt I'll be back to Monti's any time soon.Cool atmosphere.  Very laid, chill environment.  Good price on beers, but thats all I can say.  The server was pretty awful, not continually checking back with us and not friendly.  There were 4 of us and 2 of us order food initially and the orders came out about 5 minutes apart.   My friend order 1/2 dozen oysters (its an oyster house) and from his experience the person that shucked those oysters obviously was not a lover of them.  There were small broken pieces of the shell around the edges, and the bottoms were absolutely filthy dirty.  For being an oyster house you would think that would be the thing they take pride in, but not that night.  Then the remaining of our group ordered food and both those orders came out at separate times (almost 10 minutes apart) and one order was just a side of fries.  It's a great drinking atmosphere and a cool place to chill, but I wouldn't go expecting great service of great food.i don't see how this place is much better than some other fast food establishments. i'd rather go to in n n out.As a disabled veteran, I received donated passes for an event here. Upon arrival, I told the box office I was having a hard time walking, and asked that they assign me seats that didn't involve stairs. I made it very clear to her that I was not asking for "preferential seating", just anything with as few stairs as possible. She said the best she could do was put me in seat 1 at the very end of the row.

She gave me the tickets and told me to take the escalators to the left... so after walking all the way down the concourse we found out those were the ones coming down, and the one's going up were on the opposite end. Not one staff member offered help, or asked if I needed assistance getting to my seats. (In contrast, US Airways Center staff have always been amazingly helpful.)

So we finally make it up two escalators only to find out they put me in Section 203, Row A, Seat 1. TOP LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF A  FLIGHT OF STAIRS. In addition, none of the concession stands were open on that side of the arena.

My kids and I walked to the opposite side of the arena to get something for all of us to drink ($5.75 for a 20oz bottle of Diet Pepsi). When we got there, we noticed over 3/4 of the seats were empty, so I asked to sit at the very top of Section 214 in a bunch of empty folding chairs. Mind you, the seats I was given were in the FRONT row of the top section... I asked if we could sit in the TOP row. I was given plenty of attitude by the usher, but was allowed. However, my two friends, my kids, and I were given dirty looks, and harassed about everything and anything by the usher.

Well, one thing I can say for social media... is that it certainly got SOMEONE'S attention that day. My friends and I started posting about the way we were being treated, and sure enough a supervisor came up and moved the usher to another section. About an hour later, she returned to our section... all smiles.

I understand that some people with disabilities abuse the kindness of others, but when a guy asks to sit in WORSE seats than what he has tickets for... he's probably not one of those people.Ok gel manicure.
The whole process took way too long and I was left with nothing special. The awkward small talk really made things that much worse.
To top it off it was way more expensive than most of the places I go to. 

I will not be returning.Tried this place (twice) because it is close to us but the convenience of it is not worth it. The first time we went in we were a little creeped out by the darkness of it and that it was desolate. My husband tried the Mac and cheese and I had the spicy chicken sandwich. Both were bland and unimpressive. The fries were limp and tasteless. We decided to give it a second try because we really wanted it to work. The second time the atmosphere was a bit more lively. The food was no different - bland. My husband gave the Mac and cheese another try, I had the fried chicken, and the kiddos had corn dog bites. My chicken was rock hard, the skin was a strange brown/burnt color and there was also very little meat inside. Needless to say, we will not be back and if we ever come back it will be with great trepidation.Men's Wearhouse is a clean store with curteous clerks.  To bad they aren't diligent in their jobs.  Twice we've rented from them for events and each time there were numerous mistakes.  For the most recent event we had I ended up with scuffed shoes, no socks, and no suspenders.  My friends had numerous problems with their rentals as well.   

My best advice if you decide to use them is "renter beware" and make sure everyone for your event checks their rentals to make sure that they have everything and it all matches.  In their defense, Men's Wearhouse is very polite and apologetic about their mistakes but after two events where they got things wrong, giving them another chance is a tough sell.This place is ok if you live near by.  Mostly generic brands of feed at brand name prices. So no bargains here! They claim most of their stuf is Purina off labled branding...  Besure you smell the feed, bought some rancid smelling rooster mix the other day. Also they charge extra for credit cards, which is against visa's merchant policy, so not much integrity at this place! and sometimes they charge tax on poultry feed, sometimes they put its tax exempt, so watch your receipt. They are very nice at this place, just be careful! they know what their doing...Ive tried this location a couple times now and it has yet to grow on me.

They never seem to have any produce I need when I go in, Its always crowded and the staff is not very good at interacting with and helping customers.

If you pass by the cash registers with any groceries, 
staff is right there in your face asking if you are ready to check out.

I understand they are trying help out with time spent in line but my god.
All I feel like they are doing is rushing me to get out of the store.
no need to bombard me, 
half the time I'm just passing to get to the other side of the store.
If im looking towards the registers and you feel I am trying to find a short line, by all means, help out a little.
but come on,
I shouldn't feel rushed EVERY TIME I go into the store and I do.

SO ANNOYING.

if you're looking to enjoy your grocery shopping experience drive a little further to the 215 and aliante location.
Its so much nicer and more relaxed there.

this location is for people on the go that want to get in and out quick.

its also for the lower class customer.
people always walking around in pajama pants, slippers, hair a mess and smelly.
gross.

on one trip walking from my parking space to the front entrance, I was almost hit by two different cars pulling out of spots. so obviously this is the store the idiot customers come too as well. like HELLO, im literally standing directly behind your car. MIRROR CHECK, HEAD CHECK!

the location isn't that great either. Its not convenient at all.
its on major cross streets and the parking lot is always full of cars.

aliante and 215 location is so much better,
trust me.This airport is dirty, ridiculous, and not user friendly. What I mean by user friendly is... they need more outlets around the airport, so folks traveling for business can plug their lap tops and cell phones into for charging.  If you have a lay over here... good luck! I hope you're not late! You'll be walking a good mile before you reach your destination. As if traveling isn't already stressful. This airport adds to the stress... not to mention, you have slots machines every where- lose money quickly if you dare.this place for years has always been well known for their teriyaki bowls.  eh...i dont really care for teriyaki bowls, i like dishes like pork lau-lau, or kalua pork, etc... i really try to only eat the market street cafe downstairs in the california hotel for their awesomely famous oxtail soup.  so, one day my lovely dining companion joined my cousins for a quick bite to eat at aloha specialties.  oh, crap...for $15 a combo plate of pork lau-lau, macaroni salad, ahi-poke, and beef stew, plus a side order of spam musubi and 2 drinks.  first off that pork lau-lau look so sad...it was so dry...that the vegas desert dirt looked more moist.  i bit into that hard, dry, unflavored chunk of meat and yelled...wtf!!!  i didnt dip the meat in shoyu, i had to stick the meat in my mouth and then drink some shoyu to get something out of the dish.  my lovely date and i could not stop laughing at how sad the meal was.  the spam musubi was no better because it was probably sitting out too long.  the seaweed did not break off as you tried to bite through the musubi.  it was one massive chewy thing.  ooh, i hope there are better items to eat here.  it is pretty busy all the time, so there has to be something good to eat.  so i will try again...and let you knowWhen I learned of the 99 cent shrimp cocktail on one of the hundred Travel Channel shows about Las Vegas, I've been committed to try it if I ever went to Vegas.  It is the absurdity of discount food, seafood no less, and its 'famous' status that gets to me.  Similarly, on another show, a 99 cent giant hot dog was presented.  It was available at  another casino, Slots a Fun, further south on the strip.  Yeah, it looked like loaf of baloney (yes baloney, the proper word might have you think it's higher in quality or something), but I was still going to buy and eat it.

So the years have passed and the price of the shrimp cocktail has risen, 1.99 in 2008, and now this year when I finally do visit Las Vegas, 2.99.  That monstrosity of a hot dog is gone, replaced with hum drum standard Nathan's franks.  Then there it was in front of me, a tulip glass full of pale shrimp, doused in a smooth red cocktail sauce.  They were cold, watery, and completely flavorless.  Any and all flavor is just  the spicy horseradish and tomato of the sauce.  Unadorned shrimp lacked so much of everything, that taking a salt shaker and sprinkling the contents into your mouth would evoke more of an ocean-y thought.

Oh right, about the casino.  All of the table dealers were nice, even though I have no idea what their faces look like.  Craps is a low roller friendly $5, and the machines were fairly loose.  I'm glad I got that out of the way, although I'd only come back for the ample chests and gambling.Average for me, NJ pizza rules, this place was ok, no complaints.Stayed at the Carson Tower last week.  My elderly friend was mugged by a black woman who entered on the 10th floor.  She was knocked down and her purse was stolen.  Security should have been better!!!  Not even a word of apology from the casino.I would have given more stars because it was a cool experience going there, but when i got home to NY i researched the vintage "Hummel" figurine i bought, and it was a knockoff made in "occupied Japan."  It was listed at $100 with the word "Hummel" right on the tag and on the sales slip, but i talked them down to $75 thinking i got a good deal.  Apparently the max it's worth is $20 to $30 but i've seen similar ones on ebay for $5 to $10.  My boyfriend bought a 1 oz silver piece for $48 which apparently is worth $30 to $35. Not as big of a ripoff  as mine though and it's nice.  I thought at the least they'd be honest about what they were selling in terms of the Hummel figurine, and i thought they were experts who would know this.  I do like the figurine but just feel duped and that ruins their credibility for me.  It's one thing to over-price things, but when on top of that you are falsely advertising that is pretty low.First when i arrived at the casino about 8:30 pm we had to wait in the lobby for 25 mins because there computers were down and we could not check right in..Then there's an odor in the casino that hits you when you open the door gross..We check in and the rooms suck the carpet looks like its never been washed the lamp had food stains on the base gross...The best thing about this place is the shower and I must admit the food at the courtyard is great worth the trip 2 eat there but don't stay here...Then we called about the elevators because we saw previous reports and they said OH WE HAVE NEW ELEVATORS yea right...They were so slow that when u finally got one it was over crowed because everybody wants to get on and at one point there was a shoving match so they sent security which was the maintenance man to ride up and down..REALLY....We will never be back...Thank god the rooms (regular ones might i add) were nice, pretty spacious and most of all CLEAN otherwise this would've been a 1 star rating.

Moving on, 
The things that made this review a 2 star include hookers (we actually saw hookers getting arrested), Also a hooker at our starbucks meeting a hotel guest by the Inpamena tower elevators!  So this place was infested with hookers and very shady looking people.  

We ignored the hookers, but couldn't escape the late check in! HORRIBLE!  We showed up pretty early at 1pm.  They gave us a paper saying to call back and check if our room was available.  We called around 3pm and no success.  4pm we try again and were told to wait until 6pm because they are backed up.  Seriously? what hotel does that?  We ended up settling in our rooms around 630.  Wasted our first day in vegas!

Location? Well....it didn't even feel like we were in vegas.  Sure we had a car, but how inconvienient is that to always drive around, where as hotels on the strip you can walk around whenever you feel like it.  

Rio buffet was a bright spot however.  Not sure if its the "best in vegas" but it was better than average.  

Room service...I tried ordering $16.50 chicken strips, NO FRIES, and was told it would take an hour and fifteen minutes.....at 1am. On a tuesday!  okaaay...canceled that really fast.The hotel is rather dated, and is far too worn to be pulling the crap they do with all the nickel & dime charges they want to pinch customers for.   

Called to ask about an check in early and was told there would be a $20 charge.  Really?!  Decided to pass on the early check in and waited till the end of my day to go check in.  

After being scolded for pulling into the wrong valet lane so I could unload my suitcase and check in (I should have been in the common folk lane, not the super duper multi-star lane), I checked in for a two night stay.  Finally got checked in and headed to my room.  The bathroom area has a nice seated vanity area, but THERE WAS NO MIRROR over it.  Clearly there should have been because you could see the spots on the wall where there used to be adhesive.  Got past that.  Was happy to see that there was a Keurig coffee maker on the counter near the vanity.

The next morning I got up and went to make a cup of coffee.  Realized there was no coffee nor coffee condiments on the counter.  I called housekeeping and they advised that there IS coffee, but it is part of the honor bar and there is a charge if you use.  Are you kidding me?!  Another "amenity" that they want to nickel-and-dime-you-to-death with.  

Once ready to head out I decided to leave the "do not disturb" on the door as I didn't feel like securing all my valuables and computer.  Come back after a long day, slip off my shoes and am getting comfortable.  Head into the restroom area and catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror over the vanity.  Wait a minute - there WAS no mirror over the vanity this morning!  Apparently the housekeeping and engineering staff decided to completely disregard my "DO NOT DISTURB" on the door and help themselves to my room, while all my personal belongings, valuables and electronics were out in the open!  I felt violated, unsafe and totally pissed off.  When I called the front desk to complain, they asked if I'd like someone from housekeeping to contact me.  Why?  Why would I want that?!  The customer relations person I spoke to were less than sympathetic nor concerned.   I slept uneasy that night, and vowed I will never step foot into that place again.  I didn't find anything missing but that is besides the point.  They had no right in my room when I asked for privacy.

And the icing on the cake of the mirror suddenly appearing in my room was that they didn't even bother to clean it after they installed it!  There were smudges and hand prints all over it.  Nice.

So if you decide to stay here - make sure you lock up your stuff even if you have the "Do Not Disturb" placquard showing.  Because they do not respect your rights or privacy.A bit of a disapointment after some of my other dining experiences at The Palms. 

The retaraunt is set up horribly. All half table half booth combinations, the booth seating allowing for me to sink so low into the seat that I felt I needed a booster chair. 

For an appetizer we had the calamari, which on it's own was very ordinary. But the sauce that came with it was amazing! 

I am a big sushi fan and ordered the spicy albacore and yellowtail roll. It was a big waste of $9. No flavors whatsoever. Very bland.

For my entree I ordered the orange chicken. Upon arrival of my plate I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma caught my attention first, it smelled fantastic! And the portion was a good size. The taste however again was on the flavorless side.

Would have been better off catching a cheap bite at the Palms food court.Ended up staying here as my original vacation date changed due to work.  Well, you get what you pay for.  While the hotel really wasn't for me, I suppose if your trying to do Vegas on the cheap, this is a great option.  Just expect hard beds, outdated decor and slim options for dining.  The casino is large though.  

The good - I had a great view of the strip on one of the higher floors. Good drinks on the casino floor. Everything is in walking distance. 

The 'not so good' - No (decent) shopping in the hotel, (the aforementioned regarding the beds, decor and dining) and no elevator/floor security.

Excalibur needs a LOT of updating in order to compare to the true 'resort style' hotels in Vegas or it may not be around to much longer.This hotel scares me for some reason.  Scary druggies and prostitutes seem to hang around this area.  I have traveled thru a couple times to only be glad I wasn't staying there.  Had the worst glass of wine ever in Sherwood Forest sports bar on casino floor.  Krispy Kreme upstairs makes it less painful.I dragged myself this morning via the (expensive!) monorail to the Convention Center for a geek tradeshow setup.  Hmmm, what can I say, it is huge but quite tacky and old school!  Perhaps because I live a few blocks away from our very own hip Moscone Center and have worked the booths at Moscone for Oracle World many times, I found this Convention Center too old school.  What's up with the flashy carpet circa Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr.?  Quite tacky, I would say...

I was not quite impressed, in fact, I think it needs major upgrading, please update thyself, after all most geek conventions occur here, at least have a high-tech look.What I remember Goldilocks to be was a turo-turo place in El Cerrito, CA at the Pacific East Mall. (That location is closed now :( Oh, how I miss thee)

I used to love going to that one with my mom as a child.

This one was, I guess, a step up, but nothing like I remembered a Goldilocks to be.
An actual sit-down restaurant with "cooked-to-order" meals.

I would go here every now and then while attending classes at UNLV, and although I like some of the food here, it's just okay. 

What really put me off about this place is the service. Sure, they may come around for the initial greeting and order taking, but after that, it may be hard to find them... EVEN if you are one of the only people in there!

I've had a lot of the breakfast "silogs" there. I love them, but once, the waiter suggested we both get garlic fried rice with our breakfast plates and did not even warn us about the extra charge it would cost us! He acted as if it was a free upgrade. C'mon. You just cut some garlic up, throw it in some oil on a pan and swirl around the rice? That cost $1.50 extra, EACH plate. WTF? Oh well.

I've also had the crispy pata, and the pancit palabok. Not worth discussing. Decent at it's best.

Pricing wise, it's a little more than Filipino food actually costs, but it's a restaurant, so I'll excuse them. Still, they cost less than Salo Salo Grill.

I still love the baked goods, though. Pianomo rolls always are good and Buko Pandan is one of my favorite desserts hands down!

I'd suggest going somewhere else, though.My return here will be my last. I expect more from Wolfgang Puck restaurants! Two parts make a dining experience pleasant: the food, first and foremost, AND the staff. Both plain sucked at this place. Our waiter was rude and never really came by to ask us our dinner was going. In fact, the only time he ever really spoke to us aside from taking our order was while arguing with my boyfriend about beer knowledge. BLAH. My boyfriend ordered a steak that was just okay,and I ordered a pizza that was good but nothing special. There are so many other restaurants worth trying over this one!I'm somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1/2 stars.  Coming from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Mexican food.  From the hole in the one senora style to even the finer dining version of Mexican restaurants, this place was not too shabby. 
First of all, the location is a hit. Right by the canal for viewers to watch gandolas go by, it's a perfect setting. 
Then, munch on some nachos with their salsa and guacamole while sipping on some fruity margarita, dinner seemingly sounds better.
We feel the buzz from our delicioso margaritas so we go the high route and order the most expensive dish on the menu - the AZTEC BONE IN NY STEAK.  It came with the the crab cornbread with truffle butter.  Lets just say that the crab cornbread with the truffle bread saved this order because this side dish was worth going home to write about.  As for the steak, if you love overdosing on sodium or you just came out of a sweaty and exhausting basketball game, then this over salty steak is just for you!  For folks who don't crave that saltiness (that's me), I would not recommend this dish.  We had to ask for it to be redone and the waitress was extremely nice about it.  I can tell the chef or cook was snooty about this because the 2nd steak we got back had absolutely no flavor, just the meat itself.  You can tell easily what the chef was thinking when he was told that the customer didn't like his steak.
I was a big fan of the cornbread.  If you think the cornbread is worth $37 and you have money to dispose, I would give this order a shot.
And so what the steak came out overly salty and then the second one came out tame.  We had the salt from our margarita glasses that we used to pick and press onto our flavorless steak and made the most out of it.

All in all, the cornbread, the margarita, chips and salsa and the setting was good.  Just not the salty and unsalty steaks.  If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas, try Border Grill at The Mirage.I've been taken on some rides, and this one bites the big one. It costs about $7 to cab it up the strip, but the sign to the monorail beckons us near the entrance of the MGM Grand.

It keeps beckoning for at least the next twenty minutes, as we get lost in jungles of slot machines, and even two tigers are sitting in a glass cage with two people. I think they paid to be there.

So we finally get it, then debate where are we going to get off. Unfortunately, we go with my choice and we end up at the Hilton I think it was. We could see our hotel in the distance, and gradually it got further away as the monorail curved its way right away from all the popular spots. The cab ride back cost us $8, for a total ride cost of $18 between two.

Who came up with the route? At least Seattle's monorail goes somewhere, but even with that, it shut down.

Stay away from this unless you know what you're doing.This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food.  It was a fun communal experience as our dinner club ate with our hands getting food from the center of the table.  We ordered the combination platter to sample a variety of food which I enjoyed.  My friend had the Ethiopian wine which had a smell that I wasn't use to, but was different to me.  Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.  She educated us on what to order.  I did notice a roach in the bathroom crawling on the sink. I hope they exterminate.  The place is in an old strip mall that doesn't look like the most visually appealing area near the strip, but its a hidden ethnic joint for Las Vegas foodies.Definitely the rudest hotel staff I ever encountered. Everyone was rude. The check-in people were rude, the concierge was rude, the maids were rude and intrusive, the restaurant staff was rude, the people who worked at the gift store were rude, and the luggage storage guys outside the hotel were rude. It's like, "Wow, I'm paying a butt-load of money to stay here and I'm being treated like dirt." 

Steve Wynn must not care about keeping his customers at all because I never want to step inside that hotel again.I came here on a saturday afternoon and it was my first time there. HOUR AND A HALF WAIT?!?! There was a big long booth and 4 tables open? You kidding me? 

I'd like to give zero stars on the service because let me tell you, I have never experience the type of service they were giving that day. Dora, the hostess had an attitude on her. Every so often I would check about how much longer until our number will be called and she said "I am sorry I cannot give you that estimiate because it depends on how fast people eat." Really?
Then our number was skipped because she said they had to get the table ready but there was two other tables ready, I didn't understand it. I saw a customer trying to ask her a question and she turned her back at him and was like you need to go talk to your waiter and the customer was so upset, he just walked away. I think Dora should brush up on her customer service skills and be a little more happier next time. 

I gave 2 stars and put up with the wait because I heard the food was worth it. In the end I was very satified with the food but it just didn't seem like a happy environment. The place seemed stressed out.I'm sure at some point this was a nice hotel but lack of upkeep has driven this place to rock bottom. I guess also my taste is a bit skewed since I frequent the Venetian, but this hotel was free with my company for CES 2011 and I wasn't about to pass that up.

The whole hotel was pretty dirty, I thought at any moment the garage elevator might break or that one day the doors would open and a hobo would be waiting inside with a knife. Also, when I arrived at 10pm, the valet was closed...umm hello..this is Vegas...nothing closes..WHY ARE YOU CLOSED??!!!???

I also took a nap around 2pm and woke up at 6pm with a swollen eye, I blame it either on dirty pillows or one of the cleaning ladies punched me while I was sleeping because they couldn't clean the room...who knows...

I will give them points for having 76 cent water in the gift shops, comfy beds and fast room service (we asked for extra towels to be brought up.) Also, (being a girl) taking a shower and having the mirror fog up is a pain in the ass since we need to get ready afterwards. I don't know what crazy system they had but the middle of the mirror never fogged up and let it be known that I take hot enough showers to where you can't see your hand in front of your face.

Also if you want to gamble in peace, this is the place, practically dead in the casino any time of the day I came to find out. 

So not bad enough for one star..not good enough for 3...I have experienced better, actually.

I mean, just walking this place and you can feel something is missing. It for sure needs renovation.

It's really not fair. This place opened in the 50's and you can tell it's iconic and has had many stars and amazing people walk through it's halls.

However, time has clearly passed this place over. The carpets are stained and dirty, the casino feels outdated. Even the shows don't seem to call to me.

I've made a conscientious decision to plant my ass in the hotel where I'm staying at (that's the whole point, right?) throughout my weekend trips; and so I didn't linger anywhere and stayed put here.

Upon check-in, the clerk gave us the wrong room number. We had some girls come with us in a different room and they gave us another horror story of a rude check in clerk.

When I tried to watch TV, I kept fiddling around. Found the porn channel and they were charging over $12 to view it. No thanks. Internet porn is free. Thanks.

So after roaming the casino, I found a bar that seems to be the reason why I gave this place an extra star. $1 beer. That's truly something special to have.

As for everything else. The food court is dismal and one friend told me the service was horrible at the Indian food place. The Banana Leaf Cafe was horrible as well. I didn't even bother with any of the shows because none of them appealed to me, unfortunately.

The R Steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well. The only gem to be found and clearly a reason for you to visit the Riviera.

The pool was pretty neat, up until I went by the 3-ft area with the stairs to climb out and found a bunch of debris and a floating Corona cup. Not quite cool.

To make matters worse, my final night I ended up taking a walk towards Encore/Wynn, a hotel who clearly over-shadows the Riviera by a long shot. Upon entrance I can spot a difference IMMEDIATELY. There were so many beautiful women walking around and even if you took that away, you had people walking everywhere, it got so full at one point that we  almost got lost in the midst of it all.

Their nightclub 'Tryst' has more swag than the whole of the Riviera combined. And I HATE the word Swag.

Finally going back to my hotel in the wee hours and I just felt deflated. No nightclub to speak of, no night-life. Just old folks gambling.

Which brings me back to my original notion. It's not fair that an older establishment like this should be compared to by other more modern casino's. There is a certain charm to this place that should be absorbed. Unfortunately, in this day and age, I don't think that's enough to stay on par or ahead of the competition.Good concept and nice menu set up, just wish the quality of the food had been a little better. The burgers were alright but nothing special. They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people. 

I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn't into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I'd probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you're in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.

Though you are in Vegas, so if you're not too intoxicated or tired to walk a little farther then you'll probably find better options within a block.I was only slightly surprised when I pulled this place up to find it was a one and a half star establishment. I really think the low rating is attributed to the fact that people are hyped up expecting a bar like the one from the movie...

Sorry ladies and gents, this place is a pseudodive-bar located by a casino entrance...dead give away to what you really can expect. The bar itself is nothing special. Its extremely overcrowded with men and pretty much the only place you can find girls is on stage or behind the bar. I can see why this would be disappointing because its like a strip club with everyone scantily clad yet showing absolutely nothing interesting...

Moreover, the only people who get "free shots" (like in the movie) are the girls who actually get up on stage...I figure this is how they keep girls around long enough to lure more men into the place. OH but there are usually people standing around passing out free admission/no cover passes by the elevator like 15 feet away...so look for that if you wanna just go in and check it out!Only because the male strippers were funny as hell just trying to be sexy but fuck... if we don't want a dance from you don't bother us... HIS NAME IS CHILI... ugly as hell guy who kept trying to give us deals so he can dance for us.. which none of us wanted... some of the guy dancers were really nice though.. I met a guy who was from San Jose, CA pretty funny.. but seriously main room girl dancers NO FUCKING SEATS.. WTF.. but we kept getting asked to join the guys who had bachelor parties but we didn't wanna sit with them.. and saw a guy getting a hand job by some ugly stripper... HAHHAHA.I knew I wanted to look at rings before I walked in.  I was not greeted.  As soon as I got someone's attention.  I asked if the gold ring came without stones.  He said no, and turned his attention to other customers.  I had more questions and wanted to find the right gift for my brother.  I was turned off he made no suggestions and did not care to help me.  I waited minutes longer to at least try them on and see them outside of the case.  A lady finally came, she was pleasant and answered my questions.  Ultimately I wasn't interested in making a purchase from the experience I had.Wow, I'm really glad I was able to avoid this place for so long. I finally got sucked in and went for dinner with a co-worker. I thought it was bad stuff. Terrible and flavorless - tasted like crappy TGI Friday but in the jungle. Honestly, didn't enjoy anything from appetizer or entree ordered. I do not suggest it - touristy and awful. Cool waiter saved this from being a total disaster.I may have stopped by on an off day, but over the weekend, we stopped by to try out their pizza buffet (since CiCis closed down the street). The price was $6.49 per person, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot. On this particular day, the pizza felt like it was under the heat lamp for way too long and there was nothing really fresh. The fried chicken was dry and soggy. I can honestly say, the only thing that was decent was the pepperoni pizza, as that was edible. Everything else, meh..We used to come here alot when it first opened , then the novelty wore out .
         Claim jumper has good food and huge portions and a very large and diverse  menu .  They have pretty much covered there bases as far as pleasing a far ranging customer base, while still maintaining some type of quality.   I know i said the menu was huge and diverse , but as much as we used to eat here there menu didn't change much,so we moved on , anyway we decided to eat here or i should say i did.
                        The food , for apps we had the fireroasted artichokes and parmesan crusted zucchini.  The artichoke needed a little more fire roasting but was still good.  The zucchini was really good it had a nice crispy coating and  had very good flavor. 
                     I had the citrus chix salad ( lettuce, apples, dried cranberries, mandarin orange, blue cheese , candied pecans and jerk chix.)  It was a good salad with a nice sweet vinergerette, great texture, crunchy, chewy tart , sweet .  It was good but did not blow me away, kinda disappointing.
              I always order this as a side salad with my entree ,but decided to order the dinner salad portion it comes with chix.  I was always impressed when I ordered it as an  app. salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad.   Overall , I think they lost a step since i first came here, maybe the economy  , had something to do with it ,before on a Saturday night at 7 pm like on this night it would be a 30 min wait for sure.   Tonight seated right away and the restaurant remained half full.
                     I hope they bounce back to the claim jumper i remember, Because in -laws coming to town and they really enjoy it here.I only gave 2 stars based on prior visits while Dr. Carney was still there. Now on their own merits they would get 0 stars.  Now it is a total numbers racket and today they took my dogs into the back to get their shots. ALWAYS before they gave the shots in front of us. I'm quite doubtful that we got anything other than a rather large bill.  All services are a la carte including various exams which used to and should be all inclusive. Money, money, money, ching, ching, ching. I'm all for making money but for God's sake provide a little service for the buck. Me:" My dog's rear legs shake when she stands" Them: "Would you like to pay us to examine her for that?" Me: "I am paying for an exam." Them: "That's not included". Dental exams are free but of course the cleaning is $150.

We are looking for a new vet. Any suggestions?They only get 2 stars because the food was good. The service was horrible. The female bartender with the dark hair and a knitted white hat completely  ignored the women in the bar and only  seemed to be attentive to the single guys. Several different times, I had to wave my hands around and yell just to get service.  When we wanted to order food, the waiter ( a young guy with buddy holly glasses) was too busy chatting with his friend over at a table to take our order. I had to scream out for the bartender to order our food. We stayed and waited for friends who recommended the place, otherwise, we would've left.If you are on a diet this is the place to go, we felt as if we were on a salad, soup and breadstick restriction.  By the time our second soup refill made it to our table, which would have been still the first on the GV OG location, we were looking to getting out of there. Avoid the place.This place came highly rated on yelp so I was excited to try it for myself. Read that I must try "the Bobbie" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich.  Received my sandwich only to find that it was cold and dry which was a surprise to me. It had an almost leftover feel which I would find acceptable only the following days after Thanksgiving. I went up to ask to have it run through they oven to heat it up only to be swiftly shot down with a "we don't heat up The Bobbie...."  

Next time I want a Thanksgivings style sandwich in Vegas Ill stick with Earls of Sandwich down the street.  Thanks for the disappointment Capriottis....There are only a few good things to say about the dinner at Lupo. The service was reasonable and the wine glass portions were more like 1.5 or 2 glass portions, but at the price of about a glass.

Unfortunately, the food wasn't very good. I feel like any top chef can come into a city and put his stamp on a restaurant and feel free to charge whatever he wants.

Our spaghetti was just OK, and the prosciutto on our pizza was a bit stiff, and as such, unappetizing.

While Lupo isn't horrible, there are much better places to go for the price.The only thing super about this Super Wal-Mart is the length of their lines.  They are always super long!  I wish this place had self check out that would make things sooooo much easier.  I stop by here on my way to work sometimes to pick something up to eat for lunch later.  I tried to do that yesterday and only 2 registers were open and there was at least 5 people w/full shopping carts in line.  The line kept growing and growing and growing and growing.  A junkies dream come true.  I had to make a choice of being late for my job I dislike or being on time and arriving empty handed.  I didn't wanna be late so I left.  Before I left a black lady was getting irritated and yelled about the lines being long.

The second to last time I was here a new line had just opened up and I had to power walk to it quickly and sneakily cut in front of an old couple so I could get out of here in a timely manner.  This place is a retail warzone.  Not really but the lines annoy me.So now that I am the second one to review the Cinco De Mayo Massacre I will sail away in the boat of Asshole with Matthew C. I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.  

My night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila. 

Next Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other "Hot and Spicy" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno. 

So by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said," he did not get his food" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!

Yes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse. 

I will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vueltaStaff in front are fakes except a select few that actually say hi.  Salesman are nice when you sign up, but are two face when you're actually a member.  Some of the trainers are cool and some I just wouldn't listen to.  Most of the guys are upper body beast that walk on straws for legs, but not all.  Are your legs not part of your body? Yes, we can tell some of you are juiced up.  Who cares though, its your life. Lol.  Smoothies are good but overpriced.  Girls are nice to look at but it seems like all of em are conceded.  You're a living, eating, breathing, shitting creature like everyone else, shut off the insecure force field. 

All in all....this gym has good equipment. ..go around noon or midnight to avoid the above lol.

And advice for the staff...treat others how you want to be treated.  

And thanks to the cleaning staff...you guys need praise and a raise.Ok, I probably had one of the most irritating experiences here this past weekend.  All started when I got my room and then they send me to the concierge to get my parking pass.  The dude then tries to make an appointment for me to come to they're "owners update meeting." If I go, then he'll throw out some Vegas shows and freebies at me.  It's the same spiel I get every time and the goodies have all become crap items now. So really, it's not worth me sitting in an hour presentation.  But, I figure if I have time I'll try to come by Sunday "if possible".  The dude then makes an appointment for me and gives me something to sign.  I notice at the bottom he writes $20 and I ask him about it.  

Concierge: Oh yes, you're required to pay $20 if I you don't show up.

Me: HELL NO!  You shoulda let me know about that beforehand instead of trying to make me sign it without telling me! 

Concierge: I'm sorry sir, don't worry about it, I'll wave the fee.

Me: Yeah, after I just caught you in the act!  If I didn't catch you, I'd be stuck going or have to pay!

He then rips the paper he wanted me to sign and says, "God Bless You."  Like I'm supposed to feel bad for him trying to swindle me.  Yeah, I caused a scene and I was pissed! I've been an owner with Monarch Grand Vacations for over 5 years now and not once had I experienced such shadyness. That's total bs!!!!  

Also, during our stay we had to wait over an hour and a half to get more towels.  I was about to go downstairs and get it myself since it'd be much faster.  Because of the delay we were unable to get ready in time for a show we wanted to see and ended up having dinner really late.  Plus, one day during our stay, we took out the Do Not Disturb sign to have our room cleaned and guess what???  It wasn't cleaned! AAARRGGH!!!

To top it all off, when I checked out of the room I had a stimulating conversation with the lady at the front desk.

Front Desk: So how was your stay, Sir?
Me: Not so good.
Front Desk: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

That was it! WTF??  Why even ask, if you have no care as to why my stay was not so good. It's like they got robots at the counter! They even had a problem with their computers and they couldn't give me a receipt. The lady at the front desk wanted me to have a seat and wait. By that time, I'm fed up with this place and I just tell them to email it to me.(I'm still waiting on that email and will probably never get it!)

I can't believe this.  I've been hyping this place up to my family for months since it's the first time they'd be visiting.  I even told them how they could become owners.  But really, I couldn't justify recommending the place after the horrible experience I had.

I'm sending a letter to management about my experience but I'm afraid it may be handled by deaf ears.  We will see.  I'm still an owner and I like the place. The room is comfortable and the large pool is great. It's the people that need work.  I'll be back again and the service better have improved or I may seriously look into selling my timeshare.Good sandwiches but horrible service.  Staff of young boys are rude and unprofessional.I was sorta unimpressed.  I have been to many of these strip mall nail joints, and know what to expect.  However, I would not return to this one.  It is way out of my bubble of safe places to go to (within a certain distance from my house or various other places I run errands) but I was on that side of town and needed my Gelish nails redone.

The place was dirty, I don't mean maggots and moldy food dirty, just a lot of nail dust, dust and general untidiness.  It was the end of the day, so I can forgive it (but it was clearly not from just one day)

The tools weren't taken out of individual pouches like I am used to and just looked sketchy. But since she wasn't clipping cuticles, since that isn't in their gelish application like it is at C&N where I was going before, I wasn't too worried.  

The other problem was there weren't using the Official Gelish products. They used the colors, but not the base, or the cleaner like most places do.  

My Gelish also lifted super fast.  It doesn't last long for me anyways, but this one was the fastet lift ever.  I gave up on Gelish after.  

I hate giving bad reviews.  Please forgive me!  

OH! And I paid a lot more there than I did at C&N for less of a service.For some reason, everytime I go to this Home Depot (which unfortunately it is the closest one to me) I have horrible luck with the service and products. There is always 1 person to greet me at the door to send me in the right direction but after I walk away from the entrance door, i'm left on my own. I can never find anyone to help and when I finally do, they have no idea what I need because I had to travel across the store to find them in the first place and what I need is not their area of expertise. Almost every time I go there, when I am looking for something specific, they never have enough or I can't find the product. I like Home Depot the company, but this location is awful.They were fast- I got most things that I ordered within 10 minutes, but was quickly disappointed. Key word being most- they forgot several of our orders for well over a half hour and brought out the wrong beer for one person- we got a comped beer but still not a promising start. The tuna was a bit too grey. The yellowtail nigiri was described as "crispy" by one of our companions, who also claimed to have gotten a bone in his bite. The rolls were stuffed to the gills with imitation crab and a few of the fish pieces were picked off due to their unpalateable look. We've eaten at a lot of sushi places, and I was stoked when I heard people actually speaking Japanese! Plus the scallop sashimi, unlimited uni and oysters was a huge selling point for me, which was the main reason I harassed my party of four into going. While it's nice that these items are offered, the overall impact left a lot to be desired. We tried the salmon- which was OK, the highlight of the sashimi. I got scallops- a bit dull and chewy, oysters- which were fresh-ish but not fabulous, shared the "Skreem inor gazim" which was one of the better moments, a bit of soft shell crab [soooo much better at Bluefin!], a few mediocre pieces of yellowtail and tuna... one of our companions opted out of eating anything, the other barely picked at their food. I had high expectations and really wanted to like this place- I mean, AYCE sashimi?! OMG, that'd be AWESOME if the fish were more appetizing. I'll stick with Bluefin, the fish tastes a whole lot fresher and I like their in-house specials [cajun albacore, special rolls, appetizers, etc] a lot more, plus the lower price. The poki at Hikari didn't compare to the poki at Island grill or Yama. It was fun being able to speak japanese with them, and they were fairly attentive, but not worth the trip from my side of town and not worth the price for the quality of the fish. :{ Bummer!Underwhelmed
Plain and boring interior, Snooty waiters at the bar and pizzeria, staff is short and slightly rude. Pizza is good but not the best, definitely not worth waiting hours for. Overall lack luster. Will I be back? Probably not. Will I recommend to friends and out of town guests? Probably not. I can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for brick oven pizza that is much better, less wait time,  more options on their menu and genuine friendly service.I finally dined here for the first time last night and I have been meaning to come for 8 years but never managed to justify the long wait.  However, yesterday we were at the Science Center and it was early enough to not have too long of a wait, if you can say that 1.5 hours is not too long.  We grabbed a few glasses of wine at the Blanco Bar next door and settled in for our wait.  What a cute place, old rustic European country decorum in a renovated house from the 20's.  Very charming and pleasant however the wait staff...not so much.  Very odd thing here, as the staff is not outwardly rude but they are aloof and disinterested in their customers, at least from what we observed.  I had to go and ask someone for a menu and the girl who was waiting in our section had come by several times to fill water and get things for her other customers sitting right next to us.

We were finally seated and I guess I didn't specify that since we were waiting all that time that we wanted a table, as we ended up sitting at the bar, which sort of sucked.  It is a cramped situation with no real place to put your feet and I kept hitting my knees on the front of the bar.  My feet went to sleep several times from tucking them on the rung of my chair as that was the only place for them to go.  I kept bumping into my poor neighbor while I was trying to eat since her back was turned towards me.  I think she must have figured out by sitting that way she could put her feet on her friend's chair rung too, more options!  In short, I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland after she had eaten the cake that made her grow so large.

Finally the food came and I totally agree with Gabriel's review.  Very, very fresh ingredients but sorely lacking in seasoning!  We had the Caprice Salad, the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and the Margherita Pizza.  All of which were made from very fresh high quality ingredients but I found that I was salting everything!  The food was simply too bland.  I do not understand what the hype is all about frankly.  I don't understand why the long wait, outside of the fact that the place is like a friggen dollhouse!  And the waiter behind the bar was arrogant, like everyone who works there.  He could care less about who we were and if anything, I felt like we may have been putting him out a bit.  How dare we order more food and wine!  Christ I needed more wine to deal with the attitude and seating.  And OVER PRICED  for sure.

I think Cibos and the Parlor have much better food and you don't have to wait an eternity to get a table.  In fact, I'm coming to realize that Cibos is the best brick oven pizza in here in the valley.  

At least I can take this place off my list and to be honest I will not be going back.Was so excited to eat here after all the hype. A bit disappointed. CIBO has much better food and much more variety!  My husband doesn't like "fufu" food so difficult for him to pick a pizza!  He chose the Bolognese Parpadelle (meat spaghetti) and it was bland. My pizza came out a bit burnt.This review is for the stadium itself and the ambiance, not the team/mgmt/etc.

The stadium is probably the ugliest, least interesting, industrial, darkest stadium I've been in.  I've been to 15-20 venues and I'm always depressed watching a game here.  I get it, its a dome, but why it was designed with almost NO windows/light is beyond me.

The content on the jumbotron/entertainment between innings is boring and causes the crowd to lose interest.

Finally, the rattlesnake "rattle" which sounds like super loud radio static is terrible.

I like the dbacks, but ugh this stadium makes me sad.Literally a clone of Miller Park in Milwaukee, from the layout, big screen in dead center field, retractable roof, and Fridays Front Row in left field. It truly is a mirror image with better weather...but little atmosphere, fewer beer options, no sausage races, and worst of all, since it is in the heart of downtown Phoenix, no place to tailgate!For being a discount clothing and shoe store umm... some things like purses are not very discount for the damage or quality issues it may have. 

Its always like zoo in there, just to but one item would be ridiculous for the amount of time you would have to wait so not worth it.It was my first time in Vegas and I went with my friend John, now John is a vegas junkie, usually he travels out there in November and March every year. He loves hitting ther strip during March Madness.

Anyway, he had found a deal at his travel agent, he booked us two different deals, one was at Treasure Island, that deal included airfare. The other deal was two days and three nights at the Stratosphere, free. When you checked in they gave you 100 dollars in free slot play, 50 bucks cash, and free buffet. All we had to do was check in, go to the room, mess up the beds and go stay in comfort at  Treasure Island. One catch, we had to participate in a slot tourniment one of the days we were there. You had to sign up at the front desk. The tourny was every hour on the hour from 8 am to 8pm. So we signed up for 2 pm the next day to fullfill our requirements to recieve the free room.

The Stratosphere was in some sort of finacial trouble it seems and were giving rooms away to get people to gamble in their hotel. So we got our room keys (NO BELLHOPS?) we took a very old, creeky elevator to our floor and when John opened up his door he noticed people in bed watching TV, it was pretty funny, not to the people in bed though, but I still chuckle about it when he brings it up. They got it straighten out and apologized.

The place was a hole, I mean a real dump. We couldn't wait to get out of there and check in at Treasure Island. We each had fifty bucks cash from the Stratosphere and returned the next day to play in the tourny, I did'nt do very well, there but i did dump the hundred dollers in free slot play in a 5 dollare machine and walked out well ahead.

But seriously, there are so many nice places to stay in Vegas.

PS, rode the roller coaster at the top, I will never do that again, that is one crazy ass ride!We had beef pad thai and their special, #68 (difficult to remember spelling, kaag omm?), for 20.

- Hidden gem fail. You'd think this place would be great: delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price, bc its in some ghetto plaza, but it was far from a diamond in the roof.
- YES! when  you go inside, its beautiful. Pretty pictures, nice tables, and huge selection of wines. They even have a bar. 
- This place needs to be in downtown! Deceiving!
- I ADMIT! pad thai tasted great. but if you can finish it in literally 5 big bites for $10, NO WAY. Filler FAIL!
- 68: inedible. They put so many different spices to get the right flavor, that at when you're almost finished with it, you can't eat it bc the curry has too much spices and crap. 
- The bowl is CURRY (which to me, honestly is soup, lol, but really not bc its just without coconut milk) is about the size of a bowl of cereal or as much as you get when you make maruchan. haha
- This place should be called TAPAS of Siam!!!Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian/vegan options. I always have to adjust my order to fit my dietary needs and then pray it comes out correctly. My suggestion is to walk across the parking lot to Komol Thai, way better and more bang for your buck!The Osaka on Sahara is great.  The Osaka on W. Lake Mead Blvd not-so-much.  Amazing that this restaurant can drag down one that has repeatedly been on the "Best of Las Vegas" list.  Sushi was nothing to scream about.  Even though it was on the menu, staff seemed a bit bewildered when we ordered green tea ice cream.  'Twas horrible.  Tasted like a chalky green tea powder mix.2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.

Nothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.

There's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger. 

Simple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild? 
And every single combination and permutation in between. 

Hubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball. 

With that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform. 

And that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.

It's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.

I've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement. 

Seriously. Think about it. 

They both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef. 
They both offer burgers with different types of meat.
They both offer customized toppings.
They both offer multiple types of fries.
They both have milkshakes and floats.
They both serve beer.
They both cost more than in & out. 

The last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention. 

The food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill. 

Seriously? 

You're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen? 

Some nerve. 

There are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point. 

Unless you are here to try the Rossini on an expense account meal, don't bother.I dined at the bar during my stay here at Caesar's. I had to wait for just a few minutes for a seat to open. I got their white peach margarita to start. The margarita was made strong and well. I couldn't taste the white peach but it was very good nonetheless.

I ordered my appetizer and entree based on the recommendation of the bartender. The blue corn pancake with duck for appetizer and the ancho chile honey glazed salmon for entree. The blue corn pancake was more like a crepe which paired perfectly with the BBQ duck. This dish was very good! 

The salmon was cooked well but unfortunately it was too salty to eat. The first few bites were delicious - smokey flavors with a sweetness - but once I was working towards the middle of the filet, it became just salt. Then I found a big bone in my salmon as well. I left the rest of the fish untouched - at this point, it was inedible.

I rarely send back a plate and I did not send it back this time either. The bartender noticed and asked so I told him what was wrong with the dish. He offered the kitchen to remake it for me, which I appreciated, but it was late and I was already thrown off by the dish.

I was disappointed by my experience with the entree at Mesa. I wished it was edible.Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's.I like this place and think it is one of the better Madison Thai restaurants, though I think the other location on University is better and more consistent. Had take out and only one dish was memorable. Still, it's my go to take out place when I am visiting the parents on the west side of town.They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.

Food is overpriced.

Hardly any healthy options.

Servers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything.What a disappointment.  The hotel and rooms is dated but pretty clean.   I'm sure it was great in its day, but there was worn carpet, mystery stains, the bathroom mirror frame was delaminating, the mattress creaked, wall paper was torn, and the wardrobe had veneer peeling off of it.   Right outside our room there was a hole kicked in the wall.  On the main floor where its designed to be Paris streets, everything is dingy and depressing, the novelty wears off as you walk for probably a half mile to the parking garage or monorail.  The front desk is surrounded by casino, so you have to walk through the smokey slot area to check in and then get to your room.

The cable tv has about 5 basic cable channels we would all expect, and the rest are weird international channels in other languages.  Wifi is $15 per day and dropped the connection consistently.Originally posted on winodepot.com

Hummm.....where do I start. This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...

Standard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.

Writing this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.  
Think we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall.
The second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity.
Soup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.

Not only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it. For anyone thinking about trying this place, think again, avoid if possible.Do you like big checks and hype...then this is the place for you. I have heard tons of great things about this restaurant but at the end of dinner I was really let down. 

Things I liked: 
Rock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce 
Miso Cod 
Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno 

Things I didn't like: 
The waitress was not very friendly. She informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  The sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. Please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. When you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated with some love. 

The sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag. 

Also we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!

Small Dishes with Big Prices!!!   If you are on an expense account then I recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. If you are paying for it out of your pocket, then I would save my money for my kids college fund!!!Night number two was NOBU located at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Our server was younger and unpolished. The menu was overwhelming with choices and pricey. The three of us agreed on what we wanted and away we went. Out of what we ordered there are two highlights, the yellow tail with jalapeno and the Kobe beef. Again, none of the rolls were spectacular; in fact we sent one back because it tasted too fishy. I didn't feel it was worth what I spent, and felt I have had better sushi in Colorado and Houston!

FIND PICTURES ON http://jenn-uncorked.comLike the location of Monte Carlo, don't really care for the hotel rooms.  The foyer where you wait for check-in is quite nice looking.  It makes you feel like you're staying at a really nice place.  That's about the only nice part of the hotel that I can remember...

Rooms = Our room was at the end of the hall, right next to the fire alarm exit door.  Standard 2 queen room that had a leaky tub faucet.  I thought the room was bland (nothing special about it at all), the window had a hand print, and I swear to you I want to say I saw blood on the walls.  I already felt dirty.  I don't like outdated, non-decorated rooms... I felt like I was staying at one of those INNs or Motels.

I will say that if you're drunk, hungry, and like Mc Donalds... you're in luck.  There's a food court downstairs.  I don't remember what time they are open till, but I do remember being there at one point.  

The hallways are kind of creepy, but that may have just been me.  There was this one time I was leading everyone back to the room... I slid in my room card, but the light kept flashing red.  I knew that we were the very last room next to the fire exit door, but when I looked at the room number it was different - like the numbers had moved around.  I seriously felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone and started freaking out, hahaha... (mind you... yes, I was not sober - just imagine how you would feel).  That's when my friends realized we had just walked down the wrong hallway - each hallway looked exactly the same.

Yes, the rates are cheaper than other hotels on the strip, but my experience here wasn't up to my standards.  I would possibly give Monte Carlo another try if I was on a super tight budget, other than that... the room they gave me was no bueno.Sexy Vegas show - Yes.
Cirque quality - No!

When I go to a Cirque show, I expect to see a lot of impressive acrobatics.

This, in my opinion, was just burlesque with a twist.

If you want a sexy show, then go. If you expect to be impressed by the acrobatics, don't bother.Not worth it. 
For as much as it costs to stay here, the staff should be kissing your ass, not making you feel like you've overstayed your welcome immediately after check-in. 

Add some of the surliest dealers on the planet, and this place is a pass. 

Start of the day, after about 30 minutes at the blackjack tables, Dealer 'X' has been ruthlessly taking all our chips (what are the odds of the dealer hitting blackjack 3 hands out of 5?) We're all taking it lightly, cracking jokes about it. Dealer 'X' is expressionless, seeming annoyed by our presence. 
One of Us: "Dealer X, why so serious? You've barely said anything or even cracked a smile." 
Dealer X: "Maybe I'd talk more if you give me a tip" 
One of Us: "Well for you to get a tip I need to get a winning hand" 
Dealer X with unveiled hostility: "Maybe it's time for you guys to move on" 

We're paying for this abuse?
We moved down the strip to where the regular folk lose their money to good natured dealers. Unless you are chock full of haughty attitude yourself or enjoy being talked down to, I'd recommend you do the same.Ruined birthday surprise!: Our mini suite was great- it had a wet bar, comfortable bed, marble floors and a great view. There were several things wrong of a maintenance type: light bulbs out (dining area and shower), bath tub drain broken, phone near bed broken, profanity in amenities book, and the shower didn't drain.

What really ruined it for me was The Mirage ruining the surprise I had planned for my husband's birthday. I asked for Strawberries and Champagne sent to the room on his birthday. When I called to order this it took the girl 20 minutes to get my name spelled right! It isn't that difficult! Then when we arrived they called my cell to confirm... Hello! I'm with my husband! Then for God know what reason, the stuff shows up 2 days early! And what does the card say??? "Happy B-day Love," not even my name, and they couldn't write out "Birthday"??? Horrible! When I called they apologized and didn't charge me but it had already been ruined. 

I'm kind of tainted by that experience. Otherwise it seems like you are bothering a lot of the staff- from the reception desk to the hostesses. And tipping the bellman for taking the bags from the car to a 'holding area' then tipping a separate guy for taking them to the room? Please! Next time were staying at The Bellagio!

Oh, and a little trick at the pool... go any time of the day and ask an attendant to help you find a chair. They will locate chairs where people have left towels for over an hour and remove them for you! It saves you from being the 'bad' guy!THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR THE CASINO:

Came here to gamble with some friends.  We joined their players club and played on some slots.  One of the things I noticed was the crappy service from the cocktail waitresses.  They would pass you on by without even asking if you needed something.  But when you finally did flag someone down, they would take your order and never come back!!  It was really frustrating.  I waited a good 20 minutes or so and I finally realized she wasn't coming back with my drink.  I finally gave up and realized the only drink I was going to get was the one that was sitting in my hotel room.  

Slots seemed pretty tight here too.  Kept putting money in, with little to no return.  

Don't think I will be back.Looking at all the reviews, maybe I went on an off night, but I've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  Went with a group of 9 and ordered the "surf and turf" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.

The good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.

The disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.

I'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  

Weird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.Came here Friday for my birthday and it was crappy from the beginning. We walked into our room and they had not cleaned it. There were peoples bags and clothes all over the place. The bathroom was disgusting so we went back down to get another room. They comped us a free buffet which was not enough to make up for moving us to a room with a crappier view. Probably will not stay here again. The casino is boring compared to places like Planet Hollywood.what happened to the lions?!I never like TI much, but now I don't like TI for sure. So we had a bachelorette party over the weekend and everything was booked in advance and I just came along. Right before I arrive, I learned that we got a suite, but only ONE KING SIZE BED. You've got to be kidding me!!?!? Why would they even offer a SUITE with one bed? That's ridiculous and we couldn't get one with Two Beds. So 8 girls crammed into that suite with one bed. We manage to accomodate, but it was horrible. There were two bathrooms which was a good thing, but only one shower and so we all had to take turn with the shower. You can imagine how long it would take to get ready in the morning with 8 girls and one shower. Let's just say 3 hours later we still haven't left the room. 

Back to the hotel. I wanted to gamble and I did. It was dead in the casino. I played Blackjack and I never win no matter what! The dealer always end up with 21 which was ridiculous that I was starting to think the cards were rigged! I go to a lot of casinos and that never happens that 10 hand straight, dealer keeps getting 19, 20, 21. I lost $100 right then and there. BOO! Not a lot of good restaurants either which I will review in a different review.So, yeah, the Imperial Palace is inexpensive and it's right on the strip, but nowadays, the other hotels have reasonable prices too.  Get slot cards from all places and USE THEM...  They'll get you good deals too.  But if you don't gamble, and just want a cheap place to stay then Imperial it is.This is one grimy hotel and casino. Of course I didn't expect much of the IP to begin with, but I was pretty disappointing. I was actually surprised that they had keycards instead of keys. 

Pros:
1) Great location. Centrally located and is on the center strip.
2) Prices are relatively reasonable.
3) You could actually walk onto the patio and have a view of the strip in the penthouse floor.

Cons:
1) Check-in lines at the front desk take forever because they only have a few staff working.
2) Every time I step into the elevator there are more beer bottles and cups lying all over the floor. Feels like the aftermath of a college party.
3) Restaurants aren't the greatest of quality. Only ate here because it was convenient.
4) Casino is pretty small.
5) Rooms are poorly decorated. Looks like they haven't changed the style since the 1990s.I don't mean to be harsh, but I'll never eat there again. 

Sirloin should not be prepared that way, it was flat and tough. I've never had a sirloin that was as tough as that. I got the steak classic, sauce was good, but couldn't deliver the steak. I hear the view is nice on the patio but we ate inside to escape the heat so I had to leave my rating at two stars. FYI, total came out to $31 for 9 ounces of "Sirloin".OK, I admit I'm attracted to any restaurant styling itself a French Bistro, let alone at the Paris in Las Vegas. And when I'm famished, I go directly for my favorite French comfort food -- Steak Frites! Hence my visit to Mon Ami Gabi this week, where I took little note of anything else on the menu and ordered this house specialty.

At MAG, the signature "Steak + Frites" bears little resemblance to its ubiquitous French namesake, as it's a pounded, "triple tenderized" paillard of sirloin covering most of a steak platter and topped with crisp fried ribbons of potato that were difficult to eat gracefully. Amazingly, the chef managed to flash grill it to my specified "rare", but my steak knife really got a workout with the sinews throughout the meat. There was a tasty "amuse bouche" to start (with an extra serving offered by my stellar server Missy), a delicious mini-baguette that would delight most and a very nice wine list by both the glass and bottle.

The patio would always be my choice for dining here, weather permitting, and it's heated in season. With its view of Bellagio's Dancing Waters complete with audible music, this is a good spot for an enjoyable Las Vegas evening meal, but if I were you, I'd order something else. Most around me did and seemed to enjoy their choices. Bon Appetit.Steak was tasty. Service was bad-ok: they didn't clear plates between courses (I had a pile...and they kept walking by) and the service wasn't as friendly as elsewhere.

BIG gripe: they've tried to be 'cool' with their fries - they've fucked it up royally - they're so thin and crispy you can't actually eat them with a fork. A total joke - hence two stars.We came here for the view of the strip.  The ambiance was cool, very Parisian.  They told us we had a 15-20 minute wait, but our buzzer began buzzing within 5 minutes.  We went to the check in and there were 4 people working the check in counter, and it seemed nobody knew what to do.  They said, oh, two more minutes please.  (Then why did you buzz us?!) Two different people said, "Melissa, party of 4" while we stood directly in front of them and said Melissa, party of 4, yet it took another minute for someone to walk us to our seats outside.  It took some time to get served, and while 3 of us enjoyed our coffee once we ordered, it took at least 10 minutes for our fourth girl to get her cappuccino.  The menus were disgusting, covered in food, and one of the coffee cups had to be returned because it was dirty.  The menu was surprisingly filled with lots of options.  I had the eggs Benedict special which was just okay.  The eggs weren't juicy which is the whole part of eggs Benedict, the yolks were 3/4 of the way cooked.  My friend ordered the nutella waffles and seemed disappointed because the nutella was inside and pretty sparse.  Don't come here for the food, its just okay...come here for the people watching!Terrible service and terrible nachos.. large portion..didn't matter..took a couple no bites and left the rest for the dumpster diversGreatly Disappointed

 We spent 3 nights at this hotel during our stay for a conference in Las Vegas in September 2005.
The room was adequate...but we expected much more for the amount of money we paid.
The pool is always crowded - to a point where it's unpleasant. It's a beautiful pool, however, they close it frequently to cater to private parties - as early as 5PM.
During our last night, the hotel decided to have a party for, what the security department said was 10,000 people in the courtyard, which about 50% of the rooms face. It started at 8PM and continued until at least 1PM. They had the sound system blaring and it was unbearable. They are more interested in making money off of private parties than keeping their customers happy. In order to have 10,000 people - you need a VENUE - not a POOL outside of everyone's windows.
However, upon our complaint (since we had an early flight to catch we had to sleep!) they did find us a new room quickly. They didn't offer to move all of our stuff for us, but they did bring up the key. The room we were moved to was almost worth the $230 a night they charged. Almost.
So, if you're planning a stay on the strip, I have two pieces of advice:
1. Book EARLY so you're not stuck, and
2. Do NOT stay at the Flamingo.
The Hilton Company should be ashamed!
P.S. Our last stay was at the Luxor which was great...check it out!We stayed here October 20th & 21st, 2012.   The Cons: The Hotel is worn down, rooms have been upgraded, but poorly.  The floors are the plastic wood and the TV's are small 32' flat screens.   The carpet in the hallways are so old they are buckling up.  Yes, in Vegas, the rooms are mainly for sleeping, but a decent room always makes the stay all that much nicer.  The air is stale and rooms have low ceilings which I can touch and I am only 5'3".   We used to stay here regularly in the mid to late 90's, but the Hotel has definitely gone down.  Sunday night the electricity went completely out in the north wing -all 28 floors!  The elevators worked, but no water on the upper floors.  Electricity was out for about 3-4 hours, but was restored by 11:00pm.  
The Pros:  The Lobby is still presentable and their pools are still nice. Lots of plants, birds, waterfalls, picture spots.   Self-check in is a plus.   Carlos and Charlies is an ok close place for drinks and decent meal.   Margaritaville is conveniently located for a nearby drink hangout.  Conveniently located in the middle of the strip.  Don't think we'll stay here again anytime soon.   
The Recession shows on this hotel and per the reviews, it seems like other Hotels are in disrepair.  
Sad.Arrived around 2 AM. on Saturday morning.  Washed up and went down stairs to check things out.  Started to play some machines for about 20 minutes and noticed there were no cocktail waitresses.  OK... so i went to the bar and ordered two drinks, belvedere sprite and Bombay Sapphire with tonic.  It was about $21.00. The drinks were very watered down and my girlfriend didn't even finish hers.  Ended up going to the little market inside the hotel and making our own drinks. Buffet was very generic. Not coming back.Not a fan...my husband and I took our first trip away from our daughter with friends. We picked this hotel because all our friends were staying there, from the website we were under the impression that the hotel was recently remodeled. If by remodeled you mean 1980's style bathrooms-tub and sink draining-optional, by heating and A/C, be prepared to heat the hall, not your room, if you like arctic temps, A/C will be right up your alley.... Cold? Too damn bad.....only sheets provided. But I must say the upside was the staff-minus those annoying Windham reps-R-U-D-E (well most of them). I definitely wouldn't recommend this resort  to friend and family. Time to step it up....I recently stayed at the Luxor while in Las Vegas for a convention at the Mandalay Bay. I stayed in the East Tower (not the pyramid) and found the layout to be a bit disorganized to get from the lobby to your room and from your room back out to the strip or other hotels. It's not a big deal, but you can certainly tell that the towers were an afterthought and not very well planned. The in room non-wireless internet was nearly unusable which seems a bit poor in 2011! The room itself was clean and well maintained. The staff were pleasant. I would recommend that if you're looking for something other than a cheap place to sleep you find another hotel. If in-room internet access is important certainly find somewhere else to stay.Terrible customer service all around. Front desk, both Starbucks, food court, buffet... everywhere. Rude and incompetent employees.  The one exception is the bar staff at the pool.  Those guys were really cool. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the rooms were clean, comfortable, and affordable.  Still not worth staying there ever again.

Ashley, a front desk/check-in receptionist is outrageously rude.  I'm sorry for anyone who encounters her.  She's young, long dark hair... rolls her eyes a lot and gives answers like, "I don't know, I don't work in house keeping" when you ask her when your room might be available to check in.

Perry, a manager at the front, is also entirely useless.  We came at 3:00 to check in, as that's the designated check-in time, and our room was not ready.  He apparently could not find out at all when it might be ready.  Last I checked, housekeeping has walkie talkies on them and can easily be reached.  He told us the room could be ready in 5 minutes or as late as 10:00pm, that there was no guarantee on check-in time.  F that.  That is unacceptable.  We booked a suite, check-in is at 3.  Not whenever the heck they feel like it.  It was absurd.

Takes 20 mins to get an iced latte at Starbucks or a sandwich at the food court.  Also, the host staff at the More buffet is incredibly rude.It's a nice hotel, the biggest draw obviously being the pool area. With multiple pools, lots of seating (although no shade unless you pay an arm and a leg for it), and a beach, it's a great area to hang around on a sunny afternoon.

The hotel itself is decorous. It also has great food options (I enjoyed breakfast at Raffles) and bar options. Both items are very important for a Vegas hotel. 

The carpeting in the room itself was in desperate need of a good cleaning or replacement. I do not really want to be reminded of the years of partying that it has endured...

Also, as numerous reviews below have mentioned - the elevators at times took FOREVER. I thought people were exaggerating. No, they were not - and I have been in Vegas for multiple New Years Eves when there are masses of people trying to get to their rooms - this was worse.

The reason for only 2 stars, and my biggest complaint, was our check-in experience, and our overall customer service at this hotel. The woman that checked us in was very rude to us (making fun of our name!), not helpful when asking about upgrades (yes, I was trying to give them more money!), and then gave us the wrong room number!! After waiting an hour to get an elevator to go to our room to find that someone else was already in that room, we had to trek it all the way back to the desk, where she insisted we were mistaken and we should try again! Then, after looking at her computer says, "oops, I was a number off". And then essentially pushes us off to help the next guest. I realize people make mistakes all the time, no biggie, but a simple "sorry for that" would have gone a LONG way.

We experienced more rude workers at the pool, valet and our service at Raffles was beyond slow. 

All in all, I have stayed at most hotels on the strip (from the Imperial Palace to Encore), and this was the worst for customer service. Why spend the money to stay there when there are so many other options that still value customer satisfaction??I planned for our visit for two months and agonized over which steakhouse we would eat at...I should have listened to more of the naysayers. 

Like they said..food and service were ok and bill was big for what we got - $250. We also got seated in the bar area where they have a few tables with weird couch-type seating on one side. Anyway, it was Friday night and crowded but we had reservations after seeing Ka. Bread was good but not to die for like folks said. We ordered kobe skirt steak, angus filet, corn, potato puree, and mushrooms. Steaks good but not worth price they charge -- I get better beef a our local Beef Palace in Huntington Beach (look it up for best steak in OC). Corn and puree pretty tasty but the mushrooms tough, dry and rubbery..c'mon $15 bucks for that crap. BTW, we sat before the two parties on either side of us and they got served first. Wasn't too thrilled to have all the bar folks standing up behind me while I ate. 

Good gracious, I should've gone and tried Vic Anthony's. Was a fan of TC but after this I'll always start out Top Chef by giving him the stink eye.As a Chicago resident, I have dined in just about every high end steakhouse my city has to offer, so I know a thing or two about what to expect from a place that the caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as. My wife and I dined there on 09/30 for my B'day while in Las Vegas- we chose this steak house because we are both Top Chef fans and thought it would a great way to celebrate. Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience. 

Our service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a "team" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn't even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was "our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn't order one. 

The basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that's how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don't care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on. Tom C talks about this all the time on his show, and maybe we got the only bad apple out of the group, but we were both appalled by at one point, upset about it. 

Regarding the food- I have to say that it was overpriced. I had the braised short ribs- a specialty of Tom C and was very happy with them, but everything else was just average. We had high expectations that night and both left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths.For all the hype you hear, this place just sucks.  Maybe it was better before, but I get the feeling that if you don't look like a Hollywood elite, you're scoffed at.  Our waitress (who finally decided to bless us with her presence) explained that happy hour was 2 for 1 drinks.  Great, the wife and I said, and we ordered 2 margaritas.  She shows up with 4.  What's this, I asked.  It's 2 for 1, she explains, you order 1 and we bring you 2.  If I wanted 2 each I would have fucking asked for FOUR!!!  When I told her I didn't want 2 each she looked so put off (is this REALLY the first time this has ever come up sweetheart?!?) but did take away the extra 2 margaritas.  We had a few more beers and a lackluster appetizer sampler and bounced. Fuck the Pink Taco.I read an article a few years back, and the writer asked Thomas Keller what he thought of Yelp, the restaurant mogul was unfamiliar with the site.  After reading many Yelps for Bouchon, many diners are spreading their love for Keller, which was why we chose to dine at Bouchon on our holiday.  We walked into a pretty vacant restaurant, and were seated promptly.  This place is very "fine dining" but because it is located in a hotel you get all sorts of tourists.  Lets say Thomas Keller might not approve of a diner wearing cutoffs and running shoes, while choking down a $22 breakfast, but hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  My sis and i  both ordered the the breakfast plate that came with  two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche & applewood smoked bacon.  Moments later our food arrived, and my sis took one bit of her bacon, and pulled a face, the food was cold.  We debated just eating it, but if Keller can make oysters and pearls, can he not make bacon and eggs?  We told our server our issue, and she seemed shocked that there was an issue, and returned it to the kitchen.  Our plates came out again, this time they might have been 1 degree warmer.  We didn't want to send our food back for the third time, so we sucked it up.  The manager was very generous accommodating us with a box of pastries for the trouble.  
Overall i wouldn't go back, I think Thomas Keller has stretched his name a bit too thin, and this restaurant is not dishing out the same quality of food that he would oversee at The French Laundry.Food was decent, but nothing life-changing. Yes, I know it's supposed to be "simple French bistro food" and it was ok but...

Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. 

I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's "French" food.

Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. 

Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. 

My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.

This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. 

I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.I really wanted to like this place. I heard so much about it. I also went there for the view of the fountain of course (that part was great). But the food man... my goodness the food! I expected so much more. More flavors and creativeness. It did not impress me at all.Recently had our vacation, so we picked Todd English Olive ' s mainly for the view of Belligio's fountains, reviews were good so reservations were made, but unfortunately we could not get a window seat. 
The restaurant is very dark. Their drink menu is lit up, so you can read it, but the menu isn't lit, so needless to say it's very difficult to read.
The wait service was very curious and quick, but the food was up to par. We had the tuna tar tar appetizer 
( which was very bland) and the shrimp scampi flatbed ( which was very salty). Dinner consisted of also a very bland Olive's Pescatore, and a Flat iron steak, which was not bad, except for the 2 grilled gulf shrimp that were raw ( well under cooked ). I think since this restaurant mainly serves vacationers. It's a place to avoid, due to the $$$$, and there tons of other places to go.
Just look at the fountains from the sidewalk. It's a lot better and closer view!We always need food consumption after a night of dancing, alcohol, and...whatever else.  We ended up here after Vanity at 4a or so because one of the Vegas residence always comes here after her partying.  No seriously! The waiters even brought her usual order before we were given menus. 

But we obviously need to come more often so we get her treatment because holy crap did we have to wait forever for our food.  I think the majority of us were contemplating jus ditching the restaurant and going up to our rooms.  But alas, our food was served.

It's diner and after partying food so there's nothing to rave about but it's not bad.  They even brought out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle in it to celebrate our birthday lady.

If your in HRH then, of course, come here for eats but if not, then go elsewhere.  I'm sure there's plenty of other places that are prepared for the after party crowd and you won't have to wait till you pass out for your food to arrive.Brewpubs tend to be my first target whenever I visit a new city. Great Dane happened to be a couple blocks away from the punk rock show we descended upon Madison for. I was stoked... until their beer touched my lips.

It is very, very difficult for me NOT to finish a beer, no matter the circumstances: bodily capacity, time constraints, ore even a little Armageddon. But I actually abandoned some of my Crop Circle Wheat because it had become unpalatable 2/3 through the very generous pour. I enjoy wheat and citrus-y beers, but couldn't manage to finish a glass of it. 

The fact that a pair of fruit flies kept landing and launching off my lemon slice every sip didn't earn this brewpub any favors, either.

NOM'd: Crop Circle WheatUgghh what a giant clusterf**k seriously. Just stand outside and try to get in. This was a rare occasion of me +15 so they split our group up. None of the guys had to pay to get in though and the wait was less than 30 minutes. However my friend has bad luck with bouncers and he got kicked out. Inside even more of a CF. You might as well get really intimate with the 5 people that surround you, you are gonna be touching them the whole night. Go upstairs and get fresh air. Some of my party didn't like techno so they went back down. Now I love journey but damn, why are you playing that in the main room when i'm trying to get my freak on? You want us to sway left and right or something? Can someone please tell me why a 6oz bottle of water costs 8 bucks? It wasn't even a boutique brand just some plain water probably bottled from tap.

I heard on our way out one my girls was being hollered at by Mike Tyson. She told me on the elevator ride down that she was really scared because he wouldn't leave her alone. Now if I was there I'm down to save any girl but damn its Mike Tyson! I'm pretty sure he would have put me in a coma.Pure was on our agenda the second night in Vegas. We had gotten in touch with a Promoter earlier in the day, placed on the guest list, open bar til midnight for us ladies, and we were set for later that evening. 

We arrived at Caesars "fashionably late," late in the sense that we probably should have gotten there about an hour earlier not at 11PM. But, hey we figured shouldn't be to much of a wait, WRONG. There line system well it fails, I think they skipped the elementary instructions of line creation, I don't even think I could count how many different lines I saw and at one point what looked like a line was pretty much like people being herded as cattle bunched up and getting impatient, bad situation my friends. 

I make fun of the herded cattle, but MOO, haha. Apparently that bunched of group "line" was the guest list entry. I'd say the figuring out lines situation and the herding moment it took us about an hour to get into Pure, low and behold midnight no more open bar, womp womp.

Upon entry it doesn't look to crowded as your walking down hallways, then there is a people explosion. Downstairs, and my opinion is solely based on downstairs because the whole upstairs was closed off this night. There are three sections: main room in the middle, and two smaller sections one on the left and one to the right. The decor of the club is pretty plain, guess I expected a little more ambiance. And the restroom placement, I don't understand who designed this, they must have a sick-twisted sense of humor. They are located in the furthest possible corner of the main room behind the DJ, requiring you to actually navigate through/across the dance floor, not fun times. 

While I cant say I had a completely horrible time here, in all its chaos dancing was done, I just cant say that I'll be attending PURE on a future trip to Vegas.Let me tell you my experience . The first time I went there Thursday January 23rd 2014 was with my bf . I was let in and it was fun . My bf paid 10$ because I guess we were at the guest list . The reason why I put 2 stars was because the drinks are ridiculously expensive but you know it's Vegas . A bottle of beer is 9$ or other mix drinks are 14$. The dance floor for me was really small even though you can dance anywhere and there are tables to hangout with . The bathroom was kept clean . The VIP tables takes all the space . There are 2 bars and the bartenders are very friendly (maybe for the tips) the ladies gets a free drink till 12am only with VODKA AND SOME SPRITE , coke (typical sodas) . I mean I heard other clubs gives away free drinks till 1am with more choices . 

THE SECOND TIME I WENT Was last night 
I should have never came back. We were at the guest list line  until the bouncers checked my I.d. Saying that it wasn't me. Asking me about my middle name and when I graduate high school. The picture I had on my license was 4 FUCKING YEARS AGO , I look totally different PLUS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE DMVS OUT THERE THAT HAS POOR QUALITY CAMERA. The middle name I had in my license was my moms maiden name (I guess in my tradition you have to put your moms maiden name). Asking me how to spell it and I did correctly and they still wouldn't let me in. EVEN TRIED DOING MY OWN SIGNATURE .and asking me if I have other card that has my name on it(which of course they didn't look at) I'm not saying all this because I am mad about that I'm just saying that this club isn't worth it at all. 

IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CLUB TO GO ASK PEOPLE WHO LIVES THERE LONG ENOUGH .  

MY ADVISE : make sure you look like your IDENTIFICATION . Have plenty of money to spend for drinks . I GUESS THE BOUNCERS ARE MORE STRICTER  THAN THE TSA AT THE AIRPORT .This USED to be the best brunch/buffet in Vegas.  Under the new BLT name, I don't know if it's due to new ownership, management or culinary team, but Sunday brunch was terrible.  Yes the waitstaff''s service was still very attentive and the champagne was still Perrier Jouet.  But those were the only things that remained from the old beloved Sterling Brunch that I've been coming to and raving about for the past 7 years!  I've brought my mom and her friends, all are TR Diamond and 7Stars members, everytime we go to Vegas (which is way too often!).  They have enjoyed it so much, they've been bring their friends and family.  This time I brought a colleague and friend and the experience was hugely embarassing!  Just about all the seafood was oversalted (from lobster bisque to crab legs) and all the meats were way over cooked.  The lobster tails were 1/3 the size they used to be, and overcooked, dry and salty.  The crab "legs" were more like left over scraps from the spread of the old Sterling.  The "chilean" sea bass was dry and salty.  The Filet mignon was so overdone it's inedible.  The lamb chops were completely brown and tough.  There was no sushi.  No duck.  Desserts selections were also pathetic.  No crepe station.  No ice cream. No creme brule.  Overall there were only 1/2 the selections of food and at 1/4 of the quality.  It is now a waaaayyyyy overpriced mediocre buffet living off its past reputation.  Unless management raised the bar back up to pre-remodel/rename, I will not ever be back and would discourage friends and family from doing so.Okay, first, the service here is totally shitty. -5 stars, duh.

The burgers are yum. +3 stars

The beer selection? OMG BRB S&M BBQ LOL. AWESOME. +4 starsMy friends raved about this place and finally took me recently and I could not have been more disappointed.  The service was horrendous and slow.  I could have walked to either China or Mexico before I got my food.  The Diablo Chicken was dry and uninspired and the rice and beans were medicore at best.  Not sure what all the fan fare is about this place but I'll never go back.Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.The food is subpar here. The Rio is way better.
I came here because it's part of the Buffet of Buffets.

Go for the Cotton candy and pre-sliced crab legs. The chinese and indian stations looked very sad. I made myself fancy salads with chilled shrimp and snow crab legs.

The crepe station makes sweets only. It's really greasy compared to the Paris buffet.

It's a pretty small buffet.Not impressed.  Variety of food was good. The quality; not so much. Desserts were tasty. Not worth the expense.  We were charged $5 extra per person for being a group of 12....although our server was gone most of the time.  A good steak house would have been a better deal.That'd be an ICK for the food and a YAY for our waitress.

The food was super disappointing. We went in thinking we'd have a good breakfast, lots of options to choose from, and leave feeling happy and full. 

Instead, the food was marginal, overcooked and dry. There really wasn't much variety, which was sad, considering they have so many stations promising things like "Asian" or "Mexican" or "Italian". It was pretty much the same thing at each stop, with a few variations.

On my first pass - still nursing some high hopes - I grabbed an Andouille Sausage corn cake, a breakfast quiche, a scoop of hash browns, an Egg Benedict half and some scrambled eggs.

The corn cake was hard and dry, and if there was Andouille sausage in there, it was hiding from me. The breakfast quiche was so dry I couldn't even swallow the tiny bite I took. It was seriously like the Sahara Desert inside that thing. The Egg Benedict was - predictably - overcooked, though that's on me for grabbing an Egg Benedict from a steam table. If the egg was poached when it was set out, all that time above the steam and under the lights just kept right on cooking it.

The eggs and the hash browns were the best things I had that day. Both were buttery and tasty, without being too greasy. Score.

My second pass - hopes understandably diminished, but wanting to get the most out of the buffet prices - was forgettable. I tried some sautéed fruits (peaches and apples), as well as a scoop of cheesy grits and one of the pastries from the sad dessert station, but nothing blew me away.

The best thing about the morning was our waitress, Nina. She had the best personality! She joked with us, made us girls feel special, and made sure to get us what we were asking for. She then made my husband and I feel super special for having participated in the half marathon the day before, even though we weren't feeling extra special at that point. 

I wish everybody had a good, friendly, open attitude like Nina did. She's definitely the best thing we experienced at Spice Market, and I hope they appreciate her there!I had pretty high expectations for this club, seeing how it is one of the premier clubs in Vegas. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the overall experience.

First, I had no problems getting in as I was a guest at the hotel, unlike some other posers who had to wait in line. Once inside, I found it to be a bit disorganized, with small dance floors scattered here and there, none of them with enough room for the amount of people they were letting in. Going from one place to another is a pain in the ass, since there are tons of people and as another reviewer noted, lots of bottleneck locations. 

The bar is by far more disorganized than the rest of the club. There are so many people crowded around that it's almost impossible to get a drink. Think Dave and Buster's on thursday nights, times 10. I really do not like having to wait in line to get a drink when I can be on the dance floor having fun. Of course you can't do that because there are so many people, so all you end up doing here is pushing and waiting until you're tired and convince yourself that it was worth it.

Bathing chicks are nice but they do not redeem the club.the bathroom situation is a disaster. not only can i not find it b/c the layout of the club is ridiculously confusing, but the line to the girl's bathroom on the top floor is like 50 people deep. i ended up hangin around the girl's bathroom on the first floor so i can get easy access...ha ha ha! music was forgettable. guys average looking. had a good time gettin wasted w/ friends but i can do that anywhere.Really disappointing.   Extremely expensive and I've had better food at the olive garden.  Service and atmosphere are the only positives.  The bill for my wife and I after tip was $350 and we didn't order dessert.  My wife's seafood risotto was so salty it was almost unedible.Been here number of times. Have always had good food. 
Yes it is pricey. And well aware of it! 
Last visit, we asked just for a glass of their house Cab. 
$28.00 later, for a house glass. And no-one informed us.
Very sneaky !!
We felt very violated.
When brought up to Bartender...yes this is our house. It was Brunello!Very dissapointed in my visit to SW Steakhouse.  I made reservations 2 months ago for our anniversary and requested outdoor seating.  When we got to the restaurant they told me that wasn't on the reservation and tried to sit us inside in the corner.  My husband requested outside and they told us it would be a 1 hour wait.  We ended up waiting 30 minutes and they still ended up seating us inside.  Our service was awful.  We weren't drinking because I'm pregnant and my husband is training for a triathlon and I think the waiter was bugged that our bill wouldn't be as much.   After we finished our appetizer which was the lemon marinated shrimp we waited way too long for our entree.  Our waiter came by and filled up our drinks and didn't say a thing about our food so my husband asked is our entrees almost ready?  Then he said I will go check on it.   Our waiter was AWFUL and our food was ok.  During our dinner they sat a table of 15-20 next to us and we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  So much for a romantic anniversary dinner.  I will never go back to SW and I don't reccommend it to anyone.  There are much better steakhouses to eat at in Vegas.In one word... "eh..." Most expensive of our three dinners this weekend and the weakest as it goes... We shared the entire meal and had 2 glasses of their most inexpensive wine (it was good though)... Ap, Steak + 2-sides and dessert... $250 - holy cow batman...

Service was excellent! Seared Foie Gras... excellent! Bone-in ribeye - "eh" just ok... so as this is a steakhouse, how do you rate it any higher... sides were ok... can't remember em so go figure... Chocolate dessert was pretty good...

BUT NOT $250 GOOD - for a shared meal....Okay, so the food was actually pretty good in my book. Some things were overpriced ($12 guacamole), and some things were tiny ($9 gorditas), and some things were different than the waiter described ($9 tortilla soup), but the overall experienced was made TERRIBLE by the SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW service. 

45 minutes to bring the food out. Really? Not when the restaurant is 1/2 empty...unacceptable Diego.When we came the first time we were told we would have to wait 30 min so we left. However, when we passed by 10 min later the place seemed to be working again.

We ordered 2 crepes. One was barely warm, the other was cold inside so we had to ask to make it again. To make things worse, the supposedly vegetarian tomato mozzarella crepe had pieces of ham in it!

If you want a crepe, do yourself a favor and go to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio just across the road - it's INFINITELY better!Was not very thrilled about Ghost bar for a couple reasons.

First, they make everyone pay $20 to get in, even girls, and you may have to wait in line.

Upon entering they have a bar, drinks are ok, but then you have to walk through Ugly people trying to freak dance to get to the end where there is a view.

The view gets 4 stars, because it is a view of the entire strip, from a perspective of being off the strip. Great photo op, but then you have to walk through the people dancing again...

It seemed claustrophobic to me as well, and although they just remodeled it, It did not seem novel in any way.LAME!  This is my first Cirque show, and hopefully will be my last.  Yes, the engineering on the stage movements and design is mind boggling, and the performers are talented acrobats, but I didnt know what the fuck was going on during the entire performance.  I was afraid the performers would notice the contorted look of confusion and dismay on my face and fall off their ropes.  First they're on a boat that sinks, then some of them wash up on a sandy shore, then somehow they're in an arctic tundra, and then in a lush jungle, and finally in some volcanic underground lair.  Again, WTF?  The synopsis on the Ka website didnt help.  Just dispense with the impossible to follow "storyline" and have the players jumping around in colorful outfits doing insane things with their bodies.  I can accept that.  And why are the characters talking in gibberish?  And why must there be the insipid comic relief elements, this time in the form of bad French-like mimes?  And this might be picky, but during group scenes, some of the performers were out of sync with one another.  Sometimes a performer would notice he was out of sync, then stop what he was doing, and join in again later when he could actually keep up the pace.  I know these performers are generally talented, but I guess I was expecting more from Cirque.  

Maybe the nudie Cirque shows are better.I miss the more acrobatic CDS. KA was good but not great.  A lot of dancing and not a lot of acrobatics as the first CDS show I saw when they were first introduced many years ago.  This is the second time seeing one of the million CDS and I don't think I will be back to see any of the other ones.

The theater was big and interesting, staff was friendly and engaging and the production was good, but like I said it wasn't for me.

I will stick with the comedy, one time shows etc.Everyone hide!!! I'm going to kill someone!!!!! Did I just pay 130 dollars for food that is dennys quality at best. What a freaking bust. That jailhouse lunch cost almost as much as a night at the hotel here. I will not be back. Maybe if I win the lottery, ill come to buy the place and shut it down.Rice cravers don't eat here...  I Didn't like it.  Service was fair for our party of 3.  I would have rather eaten at the food court if it had been open.Why oh why... I really like dimsum and I expect a very good dimsum from a very cool modern chinese restaurant that has piano player on weekend and lots of fishy tank but oh boyyyy.. it doesn't taste as good as restaurant settings. I still remember how it tasted better one year ago when I came to this place.. but oh well..I've been reluctant to write this review because the food is so stinkin good!!! I absolutely love the green pasta (I think its $13.95) and the portions are amazing. The burgers are perfect every time and I love the fries options... But the service... oh the service, IS SO UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL. I've gotten the same guy the last couple times I went in and he is just terrible. Tyler? Taylor? something like that. But he was more worried about his hair and scarf than he was about anything going on around him. The day I went with my parents, I had to ask 3 times for him to refill my mom's ice tea. Eventually, I grabbed another server for it. I took my boyfriend and a couple of his friends in for a birthday and he had to came back two or three times because he couldn't remember what we ordered, and that was just DRINKS! On top of it, his tone and smile are so sarcastic and fake, its insulting. Its unreal how many of us will never be back because of him.Not a huge fan... the service was ok, nothing special nothing bad. The building was ok, a little dirty. The pizza was a disappointment. 

The crust is good but really didn't have much flavor, the sauce.. oh wait what sauce. There was zero. I actually asked for a side of sauce. The cheese was just enough to cover the top and nothing more. The toppings were ok. meh... 

Prices were ok I guess.

Over hyped maybe? Bad day maybe?Weeeeeeeell that might be it for me at LLXAtwood. 
Just one too many things soured my dining experience today...
...not certain I can go back. 

I walked in (admittedly towards the end of the lunch rush) and was astonished that nearly every table was covered with dirty dishes. Now I've worked in restaurants, I understand when you're hit hard it can be challenging to keep up with tables that need to be bused. I've also eaten in a lot of restaurants, which makes me qualified to say things like tables covered with dirty dishes don't scream "welcome, sit yourself down, you're in for a treat!" The waitress gave me a warm welcome, encouraged me to sit anywhere I wanted, but given my choices (a clean table or a dirty one) there were two... two tables in the entire restaurant to choose from. 

Things got worse from there. 

My egg roll was undercooked, cold on the inside and doughy. Why doughy? No clue. But doughy. 

The wontons in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth, and not in a good way. Melt in your mouth because the dumplings were overcooked. No bite. No chew. 

And while their version of Pad Thai was tasty, at 3 stars, which ought to be moderate was so spicy I had to ask for several additional napkins. Waitress must have thought I said several more spices, because she brought two over. Ironic. Unfortunate.

Also unfortunate is the fact that this place is so drastically different than LLXWilly. It's bigger and the hours are better, but neither are enough to make me want to give them another go after today.They have reallllllly hot miso soup!

I know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function. 

But hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?For breakfast, this buffet is a bit over-priced ($18.95) and not really that good. Runny scrambled eggs, a long omelet line, all types of non-breakfast items for those who can't distinguish between day and night, plus really weak coffee. I tried the Cafe in the Wynn and was much happier.

I'm afraid the House gets the best of you with this "sucker breakfast"After 1600+ reviews, what has been said has...probably already been said. Isn't there a theorem about that, or something? Whatever, I didn't get a Masters in Physics.

The wedding came and went, and we headed down to Los Angeles/Las Vegas to visit some family that weren't able to make it/vacation it up - NOTE: husband wants everyone and their mother to know that it wasn't a honeymoon because my dad came with us. Apparently a "chaperone" isn't an aphrodisiac.

We visited LV for a few days to see husband's (and now my) family. They threw us a wonderful reception and we got to catch up. One evening I suggested that we visit one of the famous buffets for breakfast. Husband thought that was a good idea, and dad wanted us to have some newlywed time to ourselves. After finding the "best" reviewed, we settled on the Wynn. I did my homework, too - we got their early as early could be, so that we wouldn't be waiting an hour and a half in line.

The price for the champagne brunch was $45/person - not cheap in the *slightest.* So, you'd think for a total of around $100, you'd want to be wowed and impressed so hard your heart stops, right? I'm looking over at the "Reviews for The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas," of all my friends whom I trust wholeheartedly with food recommendations, giving The Buffet a fulfilling 5 stars. Every one of them! Keane L. even said that the 2 hour wait was totally worth it! The reviews are all at least 2 years old, but they range from '06 to '09 - surely if there is consistency between those years, then from '09 to '11 there would be as well?

Nope.

To be honest, I can't even remember anything standing out. I had amazing prime rib at Jerry's Nugget out in crack-ville for $10 - the cut on my plate at the Wynn was blegh. The desserts were just okay, and they didn't have ANY crab - highly disappointing. The selections were - for some odd reason, because it was 8am and we were the first ones in the door - old, as if they were just sitting under the hot plate the entire time. I tried to sample as much as I could, but this all looked like regular buffet food at some regular-ass buffet. I felt like I was paying for the brand more than the food itself.

Sorry, Wynn. No crab, no stars. Presentation is top, but I'd rather have it look like a pile of dung and taste like a dream than the other way around. How utterly disappointing! Next time, I'm heading to crack-ville for breakfast.Suckest Chinese food ever had. Nothing tastes right. A couple of boiled tofu with soy sauce cost 10 dollars. Will not ever return here.Here for happy hour, it's mediocre at best. The cocktails are way to sweet.  The shrimp tempura roll was cold and soggy.  The gyoza were okay but only luke warm.  The pacific roll was good and the service was friendly.Eureka, I've got it!!! "Ah (what a) Sin" to eat here! ;) 

Ok, ok...I'm being a bit harsh. It wasn't ALL that bad, but it was not by any means ALL that great either. It was our last sushi stop on our little tour of Vegas sushi houses, and I'm glad it was! I think if I would have eaten there before; it would have turned me off to trying any others. 

I mean, I guess you get what you pay for...we were doing our little touristy walking the strip, taking pictures thing, and stumbled upon a beautiful glossy sign that read "All you can eat sushi for $20" SCORE!!! Being that we were in Vegas, we took a gamble (see what I did there, Vegas - gambling?) ok moving on....the restaurant is pretty, the outdoor dining faces the fountains @ the Bellagio...which is always an amazing show to watch so it wasn't all that bad. The food however, left us a bit disappointed. We didn't say anything though, because our waiter was so nice and kept asking if we would like anymore. He looked quite shocked that we didn't order any rolls other then our allotted 3 at a time deal...especially since we left half of the food on our plates. The maître d' was also VERY helpful with telling us about some cool comedy shows to check out...he even went as far as to phone-a-friend to see if he could score us some tickets or discounts. 

So overall, the food will be forgotten...but the service will forever be embedded in my memory. (Or until the Alzheimer kicks in) C+It seems like even though The Rio has been around for quite some time the buffet here is still considered one of the best or most talked about buffet's in Vegas, I think there are better options on the strip.  Although my family never has to wait in line when we come here there are a bunch of people that do and for hours at a time! I personally don't like buffets so this may be a biased review, however, I've eaten at my fair share and can give a review compared to the others on the strip.  It seems like rio puts out your standard buffet fair with nothing that is captivating and pleasing to the eye rather just food for the masses.  The dessert is usually the best part of any buffet and while this one did have good gelato, however, it didn't have creme brulee!! What kind of vegas buffet doesn't have creme brulee?! I had to knock off one star just for that factor alone.  Usually I come back with several plates of mini desserts and have a bite from all and have an internal battle about which one to get because they all look so cute, but this one was lacking and I had to fight to pick at least 2 desserts to try.   

Overall ... i just don't like buffets =(This was our second visit and first time with our kiddos. It will be our last!  Definitely not up to par with other FRC eateries we've been to. 

Pizza took forever to arrive (nearly 30 minutes) with nothing but our drinks to hold us thru. Our kids were excited to order chicken noodle soup, which arrived after about 15 minutes but very disappointed with the quantity of vegetables and lack of noodles and chicken. They picked thru it, with their forks and fingers (first place I've been where soup arrived without a spoon) and they were not happy. 

The two star rating is being generous given the service we received during our $42 lunch tab. During our wait I noticed how slowly the tables were bussed and was amazed at how the wait staff was so disengaged, like they would all rather be somewhere else. We noticed the manager talked with several tables, it didn't look to be a good day for him. 

When our pizza did arrive it was delicious but we were not given any plates, napkins, etc so we grabbed some from another nearby table. Very odd. 

My husband asked one of the wait staff about the soup and the manager came over to tell us how delicious it was. Not to our kids! We asked for a kids order of mac and cheese, split onto two plates. He promised it would be right over. It never made it!

We quickly ate our pizza; our kids wanted nothing to do with that! For some reason mine had green pepper instead of artichokes but I wasn't about to send it back. The kids had ordered chocolate chip cookies which came eventually and that was pretty much their meal. Really sad!

We didn't stay and wait for the mac and cheese. My son spilled his drink and we tried to clean it up by ourselves with the scant napkins we had. There were no napkins available at the drink station and no staff wanting to help so we left. 

Total bust for my Mother's Day lunch. Never going back!!!!I had coupons for $5 off for this buffet so I dragged the bf here for brunch on sunday. The buffet was $20.99 but ended up being $15.99 each w/ the coupon. The food was meh. The asian food looked sooo gross and old. I am sure it has been sitting there at least for a week or so. The only thing I really ate was the prime rib which they had to cook it more once they sliced off a piece b/c it was sooo rare. I also had a create your own omelet, that was ok. The dessert selection was lacking a bit compared to rio. Yay the rest of the food was really unappetizing. I would not recommend anyone coming here even with that $5 off.Being a buffet, you gotta compare this to other vegas buffets, and I must say I was expecting better after reading some of the reviews.  First impression were the staff who work there to seat you, and none of them looked like they wanted to be there or help you - not a smile, thank you, nary a pleasantry from anyone.  The one drink waiter who did seem amiable was not very attentive in clearing our used plates and checking in on the drinks that we ordered.  But, being a buffet, you can get away with that if the food is special, and I must say, the only thing special here are the crepes. Yes- they are good, and if you've got a hankering, then this is probably the buffet for you. But the rest of the food was, at best, average, and at worst, cold and bland.  Soups were way over-salted, an admission made by the servers themselves! Salad selections were sparse, meats were mediocre. Desserts were tasty.  Maybe it was an off-day for the buffet, but all I can say overall is that I've definitely have had better buffets in Vegas.Air conditioning doesn't make it cold, there are vague stains on the comforter, and the guy next door coughing is keeping me awake. What a hell hole for sleep. Who cares if the Club Lounge food is ample if you're exhausted. Not good for business.We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down.This place wasn't terrible, but the line looked short, but looks are deceiving.so many open tables but they never sat anyone.  Very bad if you are hungry.  Long wait after waiting in le village line.  Had eggs Benedict, ok, the potatoes had a unexpected cajun seasoning.Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.Went here on Saturday for dinner with a group of six of us. Service was so so and same with the food. Prices weren't bad and the interior is pretty 70s like?

No real complains but nothing to make me want to come back.I said medium, they gave me charred. Besides taking my order, attentiveness was no where to be found. I came because of the reviews, but was disappointed. I got the burger because it seemed like it was a specialty, but it seemed like they precook the meat, so they overcooked it and i had a dry burger. If you cant cook it right why bring it out. Overall I will give it another try, maybe they had an off day.A place is only good as its bathrooms are clean. That's what I always say. If bathrooms are filth, the place is not worth patronizing. 

Every time I have been here, I will my bladder into expanding itself so I can avoid the restrooms. Today, I could not. The bathroom needed serious attention, and I left the mall shortly thereafter because I felt a film forming on my skin just by being in the place. 

The stores themselves are fine. A lot of them have student discounts (I'm still a student of my 3-years-ago alma mater, don't tell nobody) so be sure to ask if you are a student or a cheater like me.Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.

The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.

Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked "Are you serious?" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).

In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed.I think Bernie Madoff owns this "Bank" because this is the biggest PONZI Scheme in Vegas. The second you make your deposit here,  you're never going to see the return of your investment. The club is small, not very happening and the security people are  power crazy.  

How do you boot someone from the club for dancing too 'lewd. The club is where you should be dancing lewdly! You don't want to be doing that at your parent's Holiday  Christmas Party.This was our second time here.  We were pretty disappointed again. My husband ordered the lamb and it was over cooked and very tough to cut through and when he did get a chunk of meat off the bone he almost choked on a tiny thin little bone about 2" long, so he ended up just sending his entire dinner back. I had the sea bass (which is one of my favorite meals I order every where we go) and it was pretty dry.

No complaints on the appetizers and the service was okay. I'm just not sure I would really recommend this restaurant.The view is decent, but I would say the food is subpar....I've had better at restaurants in Scottsdale. Went on a date night with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and as a foodie the food was not as good as I thought it would be. Appetizer - veggie caprese was "meh" didn't feel like it excited my taste buds in the right way. I also ordered a beef stroganoff and although they said it was supposed to be "hand made" pasta, the texture of it felt weird because it was somewhat dried/fried on the outside and dough-y on the inside. 

Service was good though as the manager there offered to take off the beef stroganoff because it wasn't good. We went to another restaurant after spending a short time there.Food is pretty average. Service is spotty at best. 

There are 2 girls working the front counter. One blond who was really stand-offish and borderline rude when I approached the front...I was standing there for nearly 1 minute wondering how to get on the list, when the other one, the brunette came by and asked the blond to put my name on the list. All this time, the blond was just standing around, twirling her hair. The brunette was friendly and made sure my name was on the list. The rude blond really did not care...wonder how many potential customers she has driven away already.

 So, I wont visit again, just due to the rude way in which I was treated at the beginningThe short and sweet version for those who don't care for my long winded reviews- I'd give it three stars for the service, but unimpressive food and the price markup for atmosphere is a bucket full of meh.

Now for the more verbose version. I was staying at the LVH and decided to drop by here for dinner. The matzo ball soup was decent if not all that notable. I ordered the Thai chicken salad. Sadly, it was mostly lettuce flecked with cilantro and drowned in dressing. The chicken itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't sufficient to break up the monotony of the greens without a better mix of vegetables to support. It just feels like a really bad recipe and that can be incredibly difficult to salvage.

The next day, I meet up with a friend of mine. She suggests dropping by here for lunch. One mediocre meal is forgivable enough, so I go back with an open mind. This time, I tried the croissant trio. Tuna salad, chicken salad, shrimp salad. I start on the tuna salad and it is quite fine. Nothing out of this world, but tasty enough that I had no regrets. The chicken salad was next. It was acceptable, although not as good as the tuna salad. This is in part because I like tuna salad more and in part because the chicken salad used larger chunks of chicken that felt a bit off. I took one bite of the shrimp salad and promptly decided that my meal was finished. Didn't need any more. Didn't want any more. Please remove this shrimp salad croissant. It is not my friend. It does not want to hang out in my stomach. I felt just fine and knew that not eating that shrimp salad was probably the best thing I could do all day to continue feeling just fine.

The servers were really pretty nice. I was seated without delay, a refill came just as my glass hit empty, and I did enjoy the atmosphere of the place. Perhaps they could take out the kitchen and just have food catered from somewhere else. That's not really what you want to hear about a restaurant, but hey. I like to point out the bright side of things when I can.This place is okay, not worth the 2.50 per cupcake, especially when you get a cupcake that is so dry that it crumbles like a cookie.  I called the place after spending 15.00 on cupcakes and they didnt seem to care too much, all I was told was that they had other complaints like those and they will try to fix it. Oh well...We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.

Best things I had:

1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.

2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.

3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.

Mediocre things:
1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.

2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!

3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?

4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)

Could have been okay but.....

1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.

2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a "cream" puff.

Yuck:

1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.

2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!

3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?

So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the "Meh. I've experienced better"We should have checked Yelp first... 

We went for breakfast, mainly out of the convenience of it being downstairs. I love buffets, but this one was SUPER underwhelming, and expensive to boot. Almost $20 for breakfast? We stayed at the Monte Carlo last year, and their buffet was better and less expensive!

There was a ton of food - I thought they had a good selection, but nothing was really that tasty. The bacon was all underdone and greasy, the salami/cheese/antipasto table seemed like it had been sitting out for FAR too long, and I grabbed an eggs benedict cup (made of a little sourdough bowl with the egg, etc inside of it) but didn't eat it because the egg looked so undercooked once I was back at the table. The omelet bar was really the shining star, but there was a consistent line of 10-12 people there at all times and we were on a time crunch, so I didn't get a chance to try it out. 

To be fair, I only had breakfast there, but based on the food I got for breakfast I wouldn't go back. Buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, and this one had absolutely nothing special to it.We were there for last three years for convention.  For $36 a dinner buffet is in a high end price but the food is not that great.
you can find a better buffet for that price.I am a lover, but I also have to be honest.  First off, I give restaurants a chance to make me a satisfied customer before I type up a negative missive.

That being said...I love sushi, I enjoy a fresh and inventive roll, know what good sushi grade meat tastes like, and will even spend extra on some good Toro.

I have been to this establishment twice because it is minutes away from home (and an extra incentive was the ubiquitous Restaurant.com certificate.)  A great piece of marketing for this little sushi place, but I don't feel that they have taken the feedback to heart.

Cons:  

Unfriendly staff.  I was almost afraid to tell the lady at the counter that the Dynamite Roll tasted like baked dog food.  Upon doing so, but with a more candid and diplomatic approach, my suspicions were confirmed that my feedback would not be welcomed.  I received no eye contact, a sneer, but an offer to let me order another roll.  No apologies, definitely no smiles, and certainly no questions to ascertain the root of the issue.  No one came to the table to follow up on our orders, to ask if we were enjoying the food, or to offer refills.  So what was the 18% gratuity for that was automatically added to the bill?  When we left the restaurant both staff members were nowhere to be seen, maybe they wanted to avoid thanking us for coming in.  Despite the certificate we had, we still spent over $60 there.

Every roll seems to have imitation crab meat, and the sushi grade is sub-par.  We sampled about six different rolls.  Quite frankly the best one was the passion fruit kiwi roll, which only had about four ingredients.  Even a baked shrimp and eel roll that was ordered had imitation crab meat.  Too much rice, not enough ingredients, and they definitely skimped on the sushi.  A $12 order of yellow tail sashimi was also disappointing, as the meat was a cut which none of us had ever seen before.  It certainly did not taste like what we were used to, and we spoke up about it.  The response was that this was just a different cut and it was all they had.  Really?!

Pros: 

Prices are reasonable, average roll is $8.

Cafe style so you order at the counter  and your meal is delivered to table.

***

There are so many wonderful sushi restaurants in the valley, dozens in that area, and I strongly believe that if you want to stay in business as a restaurant you have to offer something unique.  Whether it is the freshness and flavor of your food, or the incredible service that you offer.  Take "Sakana" for instance.  The moment you enter or leave their establishment, the entire staff greets you in Japanese.  You feel like an old friend stopping in for a visit.  Not to mention they have some of the best yellowtail sashimi, and they are generous with the portions.

Unfortunately we will never come back here.  The food is lacking in personality about as much as the staff's.The eff is going on? 
I said / thought that at least 7 times while here - while waiting in the long line, waiting for our order to be taken, seeing a couple (that was seated at the same time) get their food ten minutes before us,  while waiting another ten extra minutes for our check... 

Granted, it was pretty busy, but it was a Tuesday morning - I hate to think how it it during the weekend.  

As for the food - it was actually pretty good but  maybe that's because I was starving by the time I got it. 
I had the Bellagio waffle and added strawberries to it - definitely a good choice because I don't like it when my waffles don't have fruit. Syrup just isn't enough.  
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=L7QmuervWX8nYzFYbZsD-A&select=YwgVHyrXUY_NmkvLWBZvgg
But I stick with the two-star rating because those waffles could be purchased at almost any other cafe for less money and with better (faster) service. Plus it kept me from going back to the tables one last time - I swear I was gonna win it all back.....Not great.  Not terrible.  We all presumed that a Chinese restaurant catering to what appeared on this night to be 95% Asian community would have hit all the right notes.

San Pan Tiger Prawns were very good.  Head, legs, and tail on.  Spiced just right.  Fried enough that legs crunched to powder and head held together and juicy.

Ma Po Tofu with Pork was edible.  Not good.  There were flavors missing.  The heat was right with Szechuan pepper.  Its just that no other flavors seemed present.  Lots of tofu not enough pork. Bland.

Noodles were completely tasteless.

Mo Shoo Pork was excellent.  No question.  It came as an appetizer.  Two large pre-filled rices pancakes.  At first bite i realized it needed Hoisin sauce. The next bite made me realize I needn't ask for it as it was already in there.  Wood ear mushrooms even.  Plenty of pork and veggies.

The price for all this was under $60.  Myself and two Partners-in-Dine would have been happier if the food tasted as good as those few dishes did.

When we were ready to pay our check there were no servers on the floor. We realized an entire table of six or seven eating dinner one table over from ours were the entirety of floor STAFF having dinner together.

We had to get up and pay at the register waiting in line behind several other diners waiting to pay their bills.  I think under normal circumstances we would have paid our server.  What happened tonight I am not sure.

I don't believe any of us were so in love or even like with our food that we would go out of our way to return.I don't think I will come back here ever again. We had a 2 for 1 coupon which we thought it shouldn't be that bad if we paid only $16 for two dinners. We were wrong. I rather spend that $16 for burgers and fries at a fast food.

They got two stars for good service, and only because of good service, not the food.Not sure if I had unexpectedly higher expectations from reading all the raving reviews of this newly renovated buffet at the Rio, but I thought it was overpriced ($41/person) for the selection of seafood and desserts.

The utensils were also dirty or have very heavy water stains, which were still nicely wrapped in a napkin.  If you want real lobsters, you will have to have a coupon or pay extra for it. The tiny lobster and shrimp dish was good, but overly salted.

The Chinese food, were not very good (dim sum station's steamed shrimp dumpling had really thick doughy skin; the food looks like it has been hot-held for hours or just overcooked). The Japanese sushi station had just the low end selection of tuna, salmon, California rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls and a few other, but definitely nothing fancy or higher end). The prime rib and tri-tip station is hit and miss, depending on if you got there when they have the left overs or new roasts.

The dessert station had a fair selection of sweet treats, but due to understaffing, the guests soon empty the dessert selections and it was a long wait to individually order desserts from the staff manning the pastry station.

I do like the decor and the spacious design of the dining area, although it is relatively small compared to the buffet at the Wynn or Bellagio.

In my opinion there are far better values at other Strip buffets. So it is cool to try once and check it off of your Vegas To-Do list, but I doubt I will vote to go here again in the future.

Oh yeah, they do have a full bar, but the drinks you order will cost extra.Being a seafood lover I tend to go here whenever I'm in Vegas. The last time I went with my wife and we both brought out appetites with us, because we knew that we were going to pay $45 each to eat here. They have almost every type of seafood dish you can expect. Don't be misled by the other reviewers, the crab legs are not king but snow crab, hence a lot of work cracking legs for small mince meat rewards. I like the Thai style mussels and desserts more than anything. That being said you can get alot more for your money ($90 in my case) at any other seafood restaurant and leave just as satisfied. Make sure you get there early around 4pm unless you don't mind waiting in line for a long time. Once you make it pass the masquerade ball room in the Rio casino you can't miss it. There will be a line formed outside of this place before they open for sure.Unbelievable variety of seafood. The one major problem is that almost all of it suffers from steam table overcooking. And I didn't think the quality was all that great. Oysters? Slimy..mushy and tasteless. Cooked shrimp? Small and shell on. At $45, I would expect a little bigger and peeled. Lobster? I really think they are langostinos. They are split and the meat is about the size of your thumb. Aside from that, they were mealy and overcooked. I only had the initial 2 and didn't go back. Fried shrimp/oysters/calimari/scallops. Sounds good, but all over breaded and over fried. Fried oysters should not be crunchy. All of the fish dishes suffered the same overcookedness. Love crawdads. Theirs were small about the size of a pencil eraser.

I was excited to see steamed clams. My favorite. Problem is that the steam trays are two rows deep, and there are heat lamps under the guards, so every time you try and reach something in the back row, it's blazing hot and hard to reach. I almost had to stick my head in and under the guard to get to them and only got a few. Too hot. They were absolutely tasteless. I didn't think that was possible. It was like eating little bits of erasers.

Looking back, I honestly can't think of a single item that was good. It was very busy, so I cant blame it on a slow night. Disappointed. Will not try again.I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? 

Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! 

Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.After passing on Beauty Bar, I decided to spend my money on some grub. Usually I would order their awesome oxtail soup, but when I was about to put my order in, I saw the waitress hand another customer the new york strip special. It looked really good...

Ok, by the time my order came through, the waitress was able to drop about 5 orders of oxtail to other table. Wow, I thought, they must be taking extra good care of my food...

When I received my meal, I first tried the green beans. I will say this again, nothing is worse than frozen green beans. When you reheat them, they might look like fresh green beans, but they tasted like chewing on a sock. Horrible.

Let me get to the steak. I don't know where these Vegas casinos are getting their NY steaks, whether it's the California, South Point, Station Casinos or whatever.. I know it's all coming from the same damn place. Tough, leathery, and extremely fatty (on the outside of the steak..)

I gave this place 2 stars because they didn't screw up the french fries.

Two words when you go to this place, Oxtail, and Soup. That's all you need to remember. If I would have ordered that I would have given this place the 5 stars it deserves.Wait staff is nice and atmosphere is great but the food was not as good as everyone raves about.  We went with very large party  of 14 people who all ordered something different.  No one was raving about their food.  Yes, they do serve large portions and if you split with someone they get you with a split charge and they don't even split the meal for you.  I had my 94 year old grandmother with me as well as 2 children and they would not give her a childs meal.  One of the kids ordered off of the adult menu too.  Breakfast is the cheapest meal to prepare but this place charges $12-$18 for breakfast.  I have to say I will not return to this place again.This is one of my "miss" food adventure. Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that.  What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes.  I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an "A" restaurant. 

The Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}.  If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths.  Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.

The taste: Double word: "so-so"  (is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating "Meh. I've experienced better." And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far! 

My suggestion if you want to eat here:
Treat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better. 

For example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles. 

We brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!). Perhaps I should add 1 star for it's economical value? .. Nah :pService was good. Really expensive for breakfast. Didn't like my order much. It was something with salmon in a skillet. I like the the atmosphere though but wouldn't come again.The view and furnishings were great, but for lunch the lobster salad was served on stale croutons and the veal saltimbocca was overdone to the point of tastlessness. Multiple complaints got a tepid "sorry" and asked if I wanted a box to take my barely touched meal. Small brilliant red cherry tomatoes(?) produced iridescent red water in the toilet next day.I am very sad that I agreed to eat here.  The food was barely palatable and my drink came out COMPLETELY wrong twice.  Service was acceptable, but in the end we paid $40 for the pleasure of crappy food and a generally bad dining experience.  Blegh.Probably one of the most horrible places we've been to in Vegas. The only reason we came here was because we all drove 5 hours and were dying of starvation... literally!

First off, the service was horrible. The place was vacant and probably had 15-20 customers max, so I thought we were going to be tended to promptly. Nope we were wrong. We had to hail the waitress from across the room after we waited 10 minutes of getting seated. Did I mention we were dying of starvation?

The food finally came and it kept going down hill from there. Here's a few of the dishes we tried:

-Steak & Crab Legs: The Steak was so tough and gritty, it took my cousin almost 20 minutes to finish her steak. The Crab was still frozen. There were icicles still inside, inedible. 

-BBQ Ribs: Not bad, but not that great either. This was probably one of the mediocre dishes we had

-Salads: We ended up getting a few of the salads (Asian Salad?). They were all horrible and had no taste what so ever. 

-Turkey Sandwich: How can you go wrong with a sandwich, it wasn't bad.

Over all, this place deserves a 2 star rating entirely. We won't be back here again. I did like the fact that the manager did comp us some donuts , which were horrible also. BLAH!Food court in Paris. Good for a quick breakfast or late night drunk food. The croque messier is big enough to share. Ask them to toast it extra hot though.Open 24 hours 7 days a week! plus one star....

Chicken Chease Steak...with Cheese wiz.....yep Cheese wiz....$8.75   Ack! I do love late night food....even Mickeys hang over was closed....but please stop riping off Drunk people....Subway, quiznos and Blimpes Worse sandwiches where better than this....The bread left lots to Desire I didn't like the dry crusty bread....and could hardly cope with the bland chicken....the cheese wiz was the best part of the Sandwich...that should tell you lots....

oh great Late night Conversation with presumably Married Counter girl about Colorado...and some white "thugs" out side...about how "getto" and Hard core Texas is....(about the number of Caskets and how even the Cops don't go into the 15th ward! silly drunk white people....oh wait thats me!)

The Philiy Sandwich Company Sandwich is like the girls find on Van Buren, they may look tasty when drunk ...But stay away! they both leave you with a bad taste in your mouth......Went there the other day and found the cheesesteak to be so-so. The bread was way too dense and the quality of meat and cheese was good, but there was just not enough of it. They also have Utz potato chips and Tasty Kakes, so if you're a transplanted east coaster, you can get your fix. Also, there is no indoor seating, so it's not really good for lunch on hot days.The results of an informal poll of my dinning companions could best be described as a shrug. The pasta and sandwiches we had for dinner were passible, but I doubt we will be back.After four years of college and limited breakfast spots around, I finally got my butt over to essence bakery before 10 am for some grub. I won't lie to you, I expected a lot more. I got the big breakfast which wasn't big at all and was thrown off from their limited selection. Maybe next time I'll try lunch or some baked goods instead but trust me, NO NEED TO WAKE UP EARLY FOR THIS BREAKFAST SPOT. If you're really keen though, they serve breakfast all day on the weekends!It is interesting that this buffet is 'highly' rated, but we liked it the least out of the 4 that we tried.  WE were fortunate enough to have a free buffet each day, so we were able to compare this one with others.  The selection was minimal, the desserts were unappealing, and the taste was less than average, even for a buffet.  Don't get me wrong, you'll find enough food to fill you up and if you get it for free, even better, but I would never choose to actually PAY for this buffet.What happened to the Mirage Buffet that I remember from years ago?  We had dinner at Cravings because we were watching a show at the Mirage during our stay in Vegas.  There was no wait for the dinner buffet priced at $29 per person and we were shown to our table.  

The buffet has been remodeled since my last visit and it isn't good.  I felt like I was dining in a square shaped school cafeteria and the servers also looked liked they worked in a school cafeteria.....all they were missing was a hair net, lol.  

The buffet stations are located all along the four walls of the restaurant and the seating area was in the middle.  No ambiance at all...disappointing.  Our server, Mildred explained all of the buffet stations....seafood, Italian, American, Asian, Salad, and Dessert stations.   

My dinner buffet consisted of the following:
*  Cold Cracked Crab Legs - They were frozen and were defrosting in the buffet container.  
*  Shrimp Cocktail -  Nothing Special
*  Steamed Mussels - Again, nothing special
*  Sauteed Fish Fillet - Salty
*  Sauteed Broccolini - Fresh and delish!
*  Salad - Made to order and tasty.  There were also a couple of types of pre-made salads which were fresh.
*  Roast Beef - Dry and overcooked.
*  Desserts - Cafeteria looking desserts....enuff said.

My dinner buffet at Cravings was disappointing.  I only enjoyed my salad and some of the vege entrees for $29....plus, the setting was like a mess hall.  I wouldn't return for dinner again.  2 Stars.Wow this place was a dissapointment. 
Read the reviews before coming here and noticed majority of the low reviews were from breakfast. We went there for lunch so we thought it would be okay and wouldnt be so bad but man was it terrible!

The place is big but the food stations and choices are small and limited in my opinion. There weren't too much choices for lunch and everything i've tried tasted below average. I don't want to be so picky about buffet foods but nothing appealed to me and didn't take more than one bite, except the shrimp cocktail but how can you go wrong with that......

Save your twenty something dollars and go else where!!!!!!I have been in Vegas for about 7 yrs and while I love the town and the shows, I try to have dinner off the strip.  My GF and I have a very lengthy list of quality off the strip restaurant...just this weekend we took out her mom for dinner. Her mom's choice was Vintner Grill in Summerlin, definitely not a restaurant of our liking.
We made reservations for 7:30, when we got there the place was a quarter occupied.  That should have been our sign to walk out.  Here's the summary of our night:
* It took almost 15 mins for someone to finally come over our table and offer drink
* Typically restaurants will have off the menu specials when we asked the waiter was very short and rude
* Drinks took another 15 mins and while the waiter took our order he spilled half of my cocktail on the table.  Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said "sorry" and took off to the kitchen.  
* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. 
* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  
* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom's raviolis were OK
* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle
Between drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was "better service". 
On our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.  Probably trying to line up his date/quickie for the night. 
TIP: don't come here.  I wish I had read the reviews.  We all agreed this place is permanently a NO GOThis place has the worst service. I have been here many times and every time it seems to get worse. 

The steaks are just average, nothing special. They have a Wagyu burger that they say is amazing. This was the driest burger I have ever tasted. We also ordered the seafood appetizer for 2. This was the biggest piece of crap and total waste of money. If you order for 2 people, there should be enough for 2.

This cold appetizer plate came out with 1 shrimp, 2 clams, 1 lobster tail and 1 crab leg. Please tell me how this is for 2 people? Where we supposed to share the shrimp? OMG- When we complained they looked at us like we were crazy. I don't think so people.

I will never return to this place again. Too many chances here and they have never redeemed themselves.I'm giving this only two stars because my review is somewhat relative to the price.
Some aspects of the service were slow but it seemed to be a problem at the bar. (too much employee chatter, not enough work)  Our waiter was fine.  I ordered one of the steak specials which at $52 for about 6 ounces of meat was fairly pricey.  It was delicious but with 2 drinks and a tip it was nearing $100.  It wasn't *that* good.   There are a few other places I can think of that are equally good for less and as my every experience at Red Rock is that they are "strip" and not "locals"... I guess inflated prices go with it.If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.

In terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.

There is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point.Our service was terrible here. It took a very long for our order to be taken and even longer for it to finally be served and it wasn't terribly busy. When we asked our server to split the bill she gave us attitude saying "well I don't know who had what". So she did not split it like we asked. 
The food was not bad but I couldn't look past the poor service.Ate in the bar area.

The music was too LOUD - I couldn't hear the person across from me.

Had the lobster egg roll - it was ok.  Nice and crunchy but the flavor was meh...

Had the meat that you cook on the hot rock..... Did it once, won't do it again. 

Had the spicy tuna roll - the rice was too wet

Had the hamachi negi roll - rice was too wet

Will only come here for the drinks next time.Service without a smile. That is the summary. It was felt by the entire group that had lunch at Table 34 today that the waitress felt she was getting an automatic tip so she did not have to do much. Service was very slow even with  most of the tables empty.

The food was ok but nothing to write home about or even to take home.My wife and I were here some months ago for pizza and salad apps.  Ordered beet salad with goat cheese and greens, which I had enjoyed before.  My wife ordered appetizer with tomato and basil.  My salad didn't have the goat cheese! Her's didn't have the basil! Waiter told me the goat cheese was mixed in the dressing and could not be seen, weak. We ordered pizza, one full hour later was told it had not been started yet!  We left. I think the poor service was due to the fact we did not order alcohol and we're taking a booth that could hold more people.  I guess if you want  good service and food made according to menu, drink up. Probably won't be back.I wasn't impressed. The bread is dense and the options leave a lot to be desired. I got a veggie sandwich and even though the ingredients looked great, they didn't sing when all together. The Sundevil was better (I have to give them credit for the spicy mustard, it is divine) but still not good enough for me to go back.All the buffets are pretty much the same.  Over here you pay $28 and you get to go in and out of this buffet without worrying being hungry.  The bad part is that they close at 10 p.m. so it wasn't worth the price that I paid for.  I only had breakfast the 1st time I paid and next morning.  $28 for two breakfast still cost a little too much for me.  

Another option is to pay each meal separately.  I don't remember the price.  I think either way won't help me save much.I don't get chain restaurants.  Can a chain restaurant really serve authentic ethnic food?  Or is there such a strict code of uniformity that authenticity must be sacrificed for the masses?
I will admit there are times when a chain place can be comforting and even welcomed.  But I know full well what to expect (or not expect) at those times.
I don't think this place is a chain but it sure does have that chain feel to it.
The food was good but there wasn't enough to be filling and not worth what we paid for.  The same story goes with the margaritas.  It was refreshing but lacked a punch.  We kept waiting for a slight buzz to hit after guzzling down a pitcher.  But nada.  You can image what we said when our waitress asked if we wanted another.
Overall, it's as good if not slightly better than Chevy's or El Torito. 
And until I yelp or find something better, I'm sticking with Roberto's Taco Shop.5 of us went to the Cork'n Cleaver on New Years Day. We had a reservation.

When we arrived we were seated promptly....at the very very back of the restaurant in a room where no other people were sitting. I'm not sure if it was because we are "young" (all in our 30's)... we were dressed dressy casual, all the guys had a button up or Polo on. Not sure what the seclusion was for. 

We were seated, a girl came by for our drink order. When our waiter finally came over he handed us a meat cleaver! The menu is actually on a huge "knife". That sucker was heavy. I told him that it was all of our first times being there. He just said ok. Really? No informing us of the place. No welcome. Nothing. I was less then impressed.

We all finally ordered, the cool thing is you get a side and a trip to the salad bar for the cost of your meal. Prices there ranged between about $29-45. Ruth's Chris prices but they included a side and salad so its a good deal. They brag about the large salad bar, and while yes it is large, and I thought the chilled metal plates where neat, the salad bar was not impressive. The cucumbers and carrots were in realllly thick slices, not one bite or manageable slices. They also had caviar and anchovies on the bar....along with gummy bears and some sort of ambrosia grandma looking concoction. Pretty random selection.

The dinners arrived, 3 people all ordered the prime rib and all ordered it medium and with a baked potato...hard to mess up right? Wrong, they brought out some rice to one of them? My friend and I both got the New York strip. I was less then impressed. For $39 I expected a lot better cut and the way it was cooked just wasn't great. I asked for medium well, There was no pink at all. 

Overall for the price you get a ton of food...but is that always best?

I don't see us going back. It wasn't terrible, but not impressive in the least. The services was very lacking.Top Chef: Tom Colicchio, Head Judge, Seasons 1-5

Here's my beef with chain restaurants started by people who are looking to capitalize on being well known (Take note Wolfgang)...your "big name" is a double edged sword.  On one hand, you're hoping to draw me in to your low-end restaurant because it's Tom Colicchio's place and I've had good experience in your high-end place.  With that, though, comes the expectation on my part that you won't serve food that isn't of an appropriate quality to be associated with your name.  

I was sorely disappointed by my visit to 'wichcraft.  I mean, I'm not expecting a sandwich place to be a complete gourmet dining experience, but I judge it as a sandwich place, so its possible to get 5 stars "as a sandwich place'.  'wichcraft left a lot to be desired.  The space, in a big Vegas "strip mall" known as the shops at the MGM or whatever, was not that inviting.  The sandwich, though was bad.  The idea (pork and cabbage) was good, but there was little filling inbetween two slices of very stale bread.  Tom, if this was your elimination challenge, I would have told you to pack your knives.Were my expectations high coming in here? Sure. But it's not like I was looking for Colicchio to get his shiny head all sweaty making me a sammy in the back. I simply thought they'd have an interesting menu of overpriced, but delicious 'wich's. Wrong. The menu is boring, the sammies are small and, as expected, the prices are high (peep the pic of my slow-roasted pork pressed 'wich). Bleh. I wouldn't be proud of that sammich if I made it in my own kitchen. 

Stumbling out of Wet Republic? You'll do just fine here. For everyone else, look elsewhere for good eats.The only thing that shined was the creamy hummus and the tzatziki.  The chicken and steak kabobs seemed dry and the greek lasagna too soggy.  however, the dolmades and spanokopita were great.

Conclusion:  Maybe I expected better because someone greek recommended over Market Grille Cafe, but it was not worth definitely not worth it for the price we paid.  The only other plus was that the service was pretty attentive.As big of a whole foods fan I am, this location was underwhelming. It seems that the charm of the company was lost on this location, as opposed to the east coast markets.

I felt like I might have well have been shopping at Wal-mart.WOW, this buffet has really gone downhill ever since the last time I was here, which was a couple of years ago. The first time I was here, everything was flawless. But now, a lot of the dishes were mostly bland and mediocre. The only thing good here were the desserts.Ambience & service are great~food is okay. I got the burger, which at $17, was the cheapest option. It was dry & flavorless. The fries were limp shoestrings seasoned w/ too much salt. The salad was a joke. Two pickles and coleslaw, yes coleslaw, on two pieces of romaine.It's a sad day when I have to give this place I was once adored, 2 (+1/2) stars. I used to dream of staying here.... I stayed one summer weekend a couple of years ago and was in complete bliss... But, times have changed for the RR... They need a facelift of staff and decor. I love the modern look. Seriously, I wish my house looked like the red rock inside. However, the upkeep must not be good because it's now dingy and icky. I started my stay on the wrong foot when we walked into the check in area, and there was no staff person in sight to check us in. There was a concierge standing at his post twiddling his thumbs, and saw us there, but didn't offer to call anyone to the front desk. After 10 min of waiting, I walked over to him and asked that he make a call to have someone appear... We arrived in our room to it being only half made up from the last person. There was no new soap to wash our hands, and the bathroom was... Gross. The spa was nice, as I remembered, but the grout around the wet areas like in the showers, steam room, and spa was mildewed and grimy... Not what you would expect from them. And may I suggest... Cranberry infused sparkling water and cucumber lemon water in the spa lounge? That's how I fell in love with the spa at the M resort. Just saying... But then again, they also had Moroccan Oil products in their showers, everything was spick and span, and the ladies who worked in their spa were sweet and attentive. Again, just saying. :)I was so psyched to do the mega-tour package which would've taken me down to the south rim via plane and a helicopter view of the rim.  Unfortunately weather had another idea as snow came down and they had to cancel the trip.  

The thing that gets me upset is that they could've called to let you know what happened before they make you wake up at 5AM and then take a bus ride all around Las Vegas to pick up other people....only to have a representative call each person up one-by-one to tell you your trip is cancelled. Then you have to wait for them to finish telling everyone and rescheduling people to have the shuttle bring you back to the hotel some 4 hours later.

We ended up rescheduling to try again the next day due to the weather and chose to drive ourselves this time.  The flight time was suppose to be 8AM and they like everyone to arrive by 7:15AM.  Before we left the hotel, I gave them a call to double-check to see if the tour was cancelled or not.  They chose to tell us that the tour was still on and have everyone gather there once again.  Again, they cancelled and tried to reschedule people....again, they did it one person at a time.  This time, we didn't have to wait for everyone as we drove ourselves and we took off after being told it was cancelled....again.

For such an expensive package and great reviews, I really expected the administrative/customer service to be a little better.  Rather than have people waste their time and sleep....it would be nice if they handled cancellations due to weather better.  There were multiple ways they could've saved time and streamlined the process even if they had to wait until the very last minute to cancel....and they didn't.

There wasn't suppose to be snow at the time I booked the reservation, but next time (if there is one), I'd make sure there's nothing but sunny skies for two weeks...just to be sure.Tables & the floor looked oily & dirty.
I walked out of the store without ordering.
I can't imagine they would bother to keep inside kitchen area clean.Zia never seems to have what I am looking for.
They do have a large selection of new and used, cassettes and videos and DVDs. But I am almost always disappointed when I go there, not being able to find what I went there for.
You can sell CDs and movies there, too. But there is such a large volume of used and so many people doing it that there is usually a long wait and the pretentious staff is pretty picky.
It is worth a look, though, browsing through the large amount of used CDs and movies, sometimes there is a deal too good to pass up.this was the first Japanese restaurant I've tried out in Arizona, and I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I'm from California where the sushi is really good. this place is expensive for sushi quality I would get out of Safeway deli. We were the only ones in the restaurant which should of been warning sign number one. The only really good tasting sashimi was the salmon. 
The location is decorated in a really strange way and definitely needs to be renovated. It's also very small. Overall, go somewhere else. Not worth it.This place use to be really good. Good food and good staff. Paid $10 for 4 chicken breast sliders that were not even real chicken, more like formed chicken with rib meat and chunks of fat. Slow service. Messy bar. Only comped one pint of beer after gambling $1 hands at blackjack over 2 hours. Definitely not what I remember coming too when I still lived on that side of town a year ago.This place is not worth your money, we were there for a bachelor's party and this was a joke. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because service is decent and sides were good. 

As for the Steaks... 
The steaks were all in-consistent, a couple of filets were over salted, a couple of Rib Eyes bland one salty. I got the best part, I ordered a medium rare Ribeye and I got it med-well to well done, I asked for a replacement and got one raw in the middle with the outside tasting of gas. 

Quality of the meat, there is no way they are dry aging prime rib-eyes, the steak flavor was not there nor the moisture/fat in the meat. I would take a Choice cut from costco over coming here again. This was more in comparison to a select cut from a supermarket. 

Only saving grace was good sides, mushrooms and mac and cheese was good.My second visit was rather disappointing.  I thought he would make a few changes in the show but not so.  I went with a group and we all decided that Anthony Cools show is better.8 of us went to the Sunday Brunch to celebrate my father's  82nd birthday. They charged us a 18% gratuity--which is crazy for a buffet. The food was not very hot--unless you got a made to order omelet. The ham was dried up. Desert selection was poor and they only had a small tray of sweet rolls. We should have known to go elsewhere as they place was not crowded at 10:30am.  3 of us are locals and go to the Palms regularly to gamble but we will never go back to the buffet.I really wanted to like B and B. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a good review. Of all the dishes we ordered, I loved the grilled octopus. By husband got a seafood dish similar to Cioppino and my friend got the bolognese. We also had a salad. I can't remember what my friend's husband had. These were  all ok, but not exceptional. The worst thing we ordered was the Foie Gras Ravioli with a balsamic glaze. This was on the price fix menu, but our lovely waitress, Trina (I think) from Napa agreed to bring it to me for my entree.  What I got was I inedible. More like a balsamic soup. The balsamic overpowered everything!  Our waitress took  it off the bill, but the corking charge for our magnum of wine  was $75! I'm sorry, but that is ridiculous! Also, it was my friend's and my birthdays but nothing was done about that? Why ask if it's a special occasion if you don't plan to do anything about it?  I read that other reviewers said they were served some complimentary desserts, we got nothing. We dine at fine restaurants all the time, and I consider myself to be a bit of a foodie, but B and B Ristorante was very disappointing! I must say, I have eaten at Babbo in New York, and loved it.First of all, I wouldn't really consider this an "attraction" its more of a "curiosity".
 If you find yourself in the general area and you have 15 minutes to kill, stop by.  Otherwise you're going out of your way to see  a few lions sleeping. 
I admit, lions are not something you see every day and the opportunity to see even one (despite the fact that it's sleeping) is fairly awesome. But you arrive, wait patiently for a spot close to the glass to catch a glimpse of one, take a photo and then you just kind of stand there. And then after a minute of that you start think "Wow, these are seriously beautiful creatures. It sucks that they're stuck in this artificial environment getting gawked at all day."  I felt a little dirty afterwards. 
I will say the habitat itself is beautiful! 9 million dollars worth of beautiful.
There's also an informative recording that plays every 5-10 minutes. It tells you about the habitat, the lions and gives helpful factoids. One of which was: Lions sleep 18-20 hours a day. They are not dancing monkeys. 

To view the exhibit itself is free, but if you wanna shell out $25 bucks you and one other person can get your photo taken with a lion cub. 
I'm not gonna lie. They were reeeaaalllyyy f***ing cute!I have never had worse service in a hotel than this past weekend at Caesar's- we found the guest's before us underwear in our room, it took 6 hours for them to bring us an extra blanket and 24 for the extra pillows- our wake-up call never came- this is supposed to be a world class hotel- I don't think so- and when i told the staff about these instances- they just couldn't be bothered and the manager shrugged and said it's a holiday weekend- we don't have the staff- then hire more people- helloI booked a facial/massage here in the summer as well as a manicure for myself and a pedicure for my friend. I've been to several spas and I was very excited to come here since I love the hotel.

When I first arrived, I was greeted, given a locker, and changed into a robe. The robe wasn't fitting too well around my chest area (busty) so I asked one of the ladies if they had something else after I explained my issue and held my robe closed at the chest. I was asked to go and relax in the seating area while she got me a new robe. The new robe never arrived. 

The lady who was giving me a facial/massage came over and greeted me as I continued to hold my robe closed at the chest. She took me outside of the women's spa area and a bunch of men turned around to look at me. I wasn't too comfortable since my boobs were practically falling out. We went into a room where regular traffic of people passed through between the front desk and the spa store, I believe. As I laid there getting a facial I kept hearing people talk and laugh outside of the door. The facial was nice, but the massage felt like she was just rubbing my back in the same motion. The motions were relaxing anyhow.

One issue I had was the woman who did my facial never asked me if my skin was sensitive to anything. After the facial, my face got red and itchy. It became very dry. I wasn't sure what she used, but I could have asked myself ahead of time. I wish I had a  better experience because I wanted to love it.The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same, horrible!  I came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat 4 people who came in after me before me.  When she walked back she said, "Oh, I forgot that you needed a table for 4 as well.  Something will clear up soon."  Then our waitress was a little less than thrilled to be helping us.  The food took forever to get to our table and we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask another waiter for help.

I am all for supporting local establishments but Pita Jungle is hard to support when they seem so uninterested in their customers.We were here when they first opened up and decided to try it again to see if anything changed.  We were seated right away on hard chairs on a table for 4.  All the clutter in the middle with all the condiments is very disgusting and should be re-worked.  We put everything to the corner to get it out of our way.  Someone came right over to take our drink order and then they brought out the wrong tea, we ordered green tea, they brought us earl grey.  We ordered hot water with lemon and they forgot the lemon, we ordered Orange Juice and they forgot to bring it until we asked them more than 4x...Finally after the drink orders were straighten out and they brought us the correct stuff, our orders came out.  Avoid the hash browns, they have no flavor what so ever and the only thing in their HB are potatoes no salt or pepper, we sent them back and they bought out a very tiny bowl of fruit for us which had less than 10 small pieces of fruit.  Not real sure why they put powdered sugar on the pancakes, but they do and we did not know this so had to send our pancakes back, powdered sugar on cakes does not taste good, it is not a dessert but a breakfast item.

The gluten-free pancakes were dry, sweet and hard to eat without lots of fluid.  The make your own egg omelet with baby spinach an cheese was ok - light and airy.  Not real sure what all the fuss is about, but we were not impressed, the food is not a wow factor - everything is just either okay or not okay...nothing will wow your taste buds and there are other places in town which do this.  I wish someone someplace would make a great tasting gluten free pancake which is not dry.  We probably will not be back, not a favorite place of ours, we have had too many problems with their food or lack of good tasting food.I had buffalo wings and a side cesear salad.  The food was fine.  Nothing special.  Not too overpriced considering it is located on the strip.

I was told that they do not serve tap water (only bottled) so I was forced into purchasing a soda.

The service was horrible.  There were about 30 people dining and only one waitress.  The other waitresses were on break or hadn't started their shift.  I could see them sitting around texting on their phones while I got bad service.

They turned on the audio to some basketball game.  It was way too loud.  I had to scream to my friend sitting accross the table.

The food is 3 stars.  The service is 1 star.  Averages to 2 stars.Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. 

I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.All I can say is, somewhere out there, Hugh Hefner is crying tears of sadness because of this club.
(Note- the word "club" is definitely a misnomer for this place. Read on.)

But 3.5 stars for a Vegas club? Maybe I went on a bad night...

--the music... was whatever. Granted, it was hip-hop, but it really wasn't anything memorable. It was definitely not like XS or Pure where 1) roofs are raised, 2) we went to the window and to 3) the wall, and 4) sweat did drip down some balls. 

--the club... was was whatever. Pretty, but what Vegas club isn't pretty? There's a dance floor in the middle, but there are SO many couches and lounge areas around the club that people seem to just like sitting around instead of dancing!! But hey, maybe that's because....

-the drinks were SO expensive!!! Do you think your customers are ballers? Please. Then they wouldn't be at the Playboy Club!

There were SOME good things about this place though: amazing decor and really good view.I went there today to check out the Hatch Chili Throw-down that was starting at 1:00pm. 

We got there and noticed that is location is just like the market on Power Rd. named Guadalupe Farmers Market Too. 
Then the light bulb goes off "ding"...wow talk about a blond moment. I guess the names give away the relation. Anyway.. 

The cook-off was no where to be seen, but they were roasting fresh Hatch chilies. I was not really impressed with the selection inside and the prices were a bit high. We ended up getting some delicious smelling chilies and fresh tortillas. (Food City has cheaper roasted Hatch chilies on the weekend). 
It was a nice trip but I'm not sure it is worth a second try.Walls are very thin.  Television next door had me up all night. Very disappointed.  Closet very small as well.  Barley enough room for 1 persons belongings.Thing is..this store cannot compete with Frye's..and the proof is that there is hardly anyone there.  Limited selection on items, (I mean really..No Baker's Choc??) and the Starbucks..while staffed with very good people...alway has a line out the door on Sunday with pajama-clad coffee drinkers (P.S..go to Tully's at Frye's..no line and great coffee).  But what I really dislike is the few times I do go to Basha's, mainly for a sale..I am in line forever...one checker is only opened..and I am usually behind WIC people who divide up orders between baby formula (paid for by WIC) and about 10 bottles' of 40s (paid for with crumpled dollar bills).  So clerks are nice, store is clean, just is not on the level of Frye's, and they are more expensive.The chile relleno--the standard by which all Mexican food restaurants should judged due to the difficulty in preparation--was soggy with a bland ranchero sauce and stuffed with cheese that quickly solidified into a chewy slug. Stick to the tasty mole sauce, which covered some dry chicken stuffed enchiladas.Traveled for work and we have a corporate agreement with them. I arrived at the hotel and was informed that they did not have my King bed available, I never get how you reserve a room and then they are out. I asked if I could get an upgrade, which they obliged and put me on the executive business floor. The floor smelled of cigarette smoke. The hotel needs some repairs overall, which they said they were going to remodel. Room was clean, some dirt behind the bed, yes I look everywhere and the little closet was in very rough shape. What I was really upset about is that these hotels and our agreement is supposed to have a Sleep Number bed. It's even advertised. Nope, not in the executive floor rooms. Makes sense right? My mattress was worn and not comfortable at all, prob the worst night sleep ever. Was not rested for the big meeting the next day. IAsk for the Sleep number!We have eaten at El Encanto Dos twice and we won't be returning.  The food is fairly gringo and I feel over priced for what you get.  The real rub for us is the service. We had ordered margaritas and 2 entrees (Jalepeno Rellenos and Green Chile Burro). The burrito was dry and tortillas thick and not warmed.  I would have asked to send it back but we didn't see our waitress except when we flagged her down for water. When we asked for more water it came about 10 minutes later with a grunt from the waitress as she dropped off the carafe. She actually slid it across our table as she passed by, never making eye contact not even breaking stride. As my husband poured our waters for us he looked at me and we said in unison, never again. Our waitress never checked in with us or asked if we needed anything. 

The restraunt is pretty and the patio looked nice.  It could use a good scrubbing, the windows were dirty, splatters on the wall next to our booth, the table and menus were sticky,the bathroom was dusty with grime on the stall doors.  Just not a good feeling at all and quite disappointing.  I think I could have tolerated the food but the service or the lack of, is what sent us over the edge and the point of no return.....Overpriced. Dry pork. 
Specials don't save much. 
Tea is good.
You want some great BBQ, ribs, etc? Go to Hap's BBQ on Washington st. and 52nd st. Next to samurai Sam's.The service was okay.  The food was terrible.  The cooks do not make the french fries to order.  They cook a large batch and place them in a metal container that sits at the pass.  After discussing this with the manager I was  told that there is a four minute turn around on the fries.  I did not see any fries added to that container for at least 20 mins.  Our dinner sat at the pass for at least eight minutes after our appetizer was served.  If you are going for the atmosphere that is fine.  If you are going for the food, I would suggest going somewhere else.I used to LOVE Freddy's.  We started going when we were in Texas on vacation and then the opened this location and WOW...we had a favorite.

We have been to this location several times and the location in Gilbert twice.  It used to be that EVERY time we went it was AMAZING!!  Now, it is hit or miss.  Last visit to this location the fries were WAY overcooked...quality control would tell you not to send out burnt fries, but no they sent them right out to us.  I think the little burger has shrunk and it was small before.  

Ouch, why is it that when you start to really love a place it goes downhill?  Well, at least In & Out burger stays consistant and since I now live in SoCal I guess we won't be missing Freddy's anymore.The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.I go here because it is close to my house, but it is usually a disappointing experience. First, the pricing practices by Kroger (and most other large grocery chains) are misleading at best. Surreptitiously down-sizing quantities, e.g. coffee, without lowering the price is one practice. The other is calling it a sale when they mark up an item then promote it as "buy one, get one free". Most consumers know it is bull@$#t, but their marketing geniuses really think they are pulling one off. This week Fry's advertised pork ribs, "buy one get two free". But their price for these ribs is $7.99/lb!! Gristly old pork ribs that normally sell for $1.99 - $2.99 per pound marked up to the price of a quality sirloin steak. I know the definition of a lie is pretty vague in business, but this type of pricing practice is about as close as it gets. They pretty much all do it so we have little choice in taking our business elsewhere, though this time I went to Sprouts and bought them for the honest price of $2.99 a pound. 
The second issue is service. In business you can always have one employee that is having a bad day or is just bad at customer relations, but most of their checkout employees here seem unhappy. Don't know why, but maybe their personnel policies have the same effect on employee morale as their pricing policies have on consumers.I'm going to keep it simple! 2 MEDIUM pizzas (Vortex and Hawaiian) = $45 freakin ridiculous! The pizza was good! I'll go back when I win the lottery!um...... no

I have been to this Blockbuster before with out any major issues but the incident that went down the other night provoked me into uncharted yelping territory. 
Now, I've had crappy experiences at establishments before (haven't we all) but only a couple of times in my life have I been made to feel criminal. (when I wasn't being a fucking criminal) 

I rode down to drop a couple of movies off and pick up a couple more. I don't have a rack or fancy dancy basket on my bike so when I go somewhere that I will need to transport items to or from I wear my backpack. ....can you see where this is going....

I walk in, drop of the movies I had and begin moseying around the store. The 17 yr. old employee comes up to me and asks if I would mind leaving my backpack up at the front. UM... YES KIDDO, I WOULD MIND. 
I begin getting disoriented and confused..... did I just step out of a fucking time machine as the 1991 "candy raver" version of myself?? Do I look like I'm about to rob your damn store for anything I can sell so I can buy more ecstasy?? Do I have a "binkie" hanging out of my mouth??
Ahem....... NO. I'm a 32 yr old "lady" that just dropped off 3 movies and can *gasp* afford to rent a couple more. I'm not giving your 17 year old ass my backpack, plain and simple. Why, so you can rob me? No thanks. One thing I will give him is that he didn't put up much of a fight. I said no and he moved on pretty quickly. Still confused, I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I just know I'm pretty sure I'm going to upgrade my Netflix account.

sheesh .... and to think I rode right past Movies On Central.   grrrrrI just tried this place based on the reviews on here but I was disappointed. No ambiance, though that's not always a bad thing. The staff was courteous but the food left lots to be desired. The spring rolls,  which I always look forward to at Vietnamese restaurants, were wimpy. The pho was ok,  nothing special. I had to ask for cilantro on the side. I'd come here again if I was really craving pho and didn't have time to go anywhere else.The search for decent Chinese food in the valley continues, as Jong Wah won't be our go-to place.

We started with the Popo Platter. Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.

We ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.

The house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.

We also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.

They do have an outdoor patio.Yummy food and excellent service, as always. However Beau and I have been scrupulous when evaluating restaurants' hygiene; it was unsettling to see them sweep the floor with raw food, clean plates and prep bowls so very low to the floor. Most servers had their hair pulled back tightly, or very short, with one exception - and her long loose hair stood out. It was disappointing that they charged extra for a broccoli substitute for pasta.It's like the star rating, "Meh, I've experienced much better."  I only liked their nice little patio, it looked very cozy. We came here for lunch, but then decided to order takeouts.

Nobody came to greet us when we walked in; it's not even that busy. We actually had to walk to the sushi bar and ask for a memu. I ordered a shrimp tempura roll with a side of edamame, my friend ordered their specialty Vegas roll. It took about 15 mins to get the two rolls ready when the place was pretty empty.

The taste was just average, sushi rice was VERY sticky! And when we opened our box, my shrimp tempura roll was all by itself with some wasabi, no soy sauce packages; and my friend's Vegas roll was with some eel sauce, no soy sauce nor wasabi. How are we supposed to eat??? And the menu described warm soy beans,,,my edamame was really cold and had water dripping....Ok, so we all know moving sucks.  Especially moving ones self...even if it is acoss town.

Anyways, I had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from Chandler to Mesa.  I was moving a whopping 12 miles, but I just needed a 10 foot truck to do one trip with to get my mattress, bedroom furniture, couch, and other random stuff to the new apartment.  Fine.

So, I go in the night before I needed it and made a reservation for the truck.  Fine.  I go back the next morning, to get the truck, and this is where I get upset.  I'm already stressed out from moving, its hot as heck outside, and I want to get this overwith.  Im the only person in the store and its 8 AM.

So, I go to the counter.  A guy helps me, who's name I will not list in this review, even though I remember it.  He's filling out the stuff in the computer, and asks me for a secondary phone #.  I told him I did not have one, and the only one I have is my cell number. Well, I guess that was a huge problem to him, and he basically snapped at me and said "look, I need a second phone number for you.  I'm just trying to fill out the paperwork!  Just give me your work number, okay?"  

Crap. Now I've been scolded by the uhaul man for not having a second phone #, and clearly this is really screwing up his day, really bad.   Now, I'm the bad guy.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a fax number.  Yea, call THAT and reach me.

So, then, they go to get me my truck.  Well, guess what?  It has no gas, because someone siphoned it out overnight! So the guy says to me "did you want to wait for 15 minutes for me to gas the truck, or did you just want to take it empty?"  Why would I want to drive a uhaul that has zero gas in it???  So I can be stranded a mile down the road, and make this day longer?????  So, I waited for him to gas it.

Now, while I was waiting, and cranky counter man was gassing the truck up, two other employees waltz in.  I asked if they worked here, and they said that they are uhaul employees, but they are finance from corporate.  nice.  

See, I normally dont get mad, but I was so stressed from moving, and after getting scolded, I had to complain to someone.  So, I tell finance that counter boy is very cranky this morning and scolded me for not having a secondary phone number, and I dont appriciate it.  They were like "uh, ok thanks."

Anyways, cranky counterboy comes back with the truck, which was nice by the way.  Clean, fast, and most importantly, with gas!  I take the truck, move my stuff, and return it.  I think he got told that I complained becuase I got a few bucks off the dolly rental that I had....plus, he was in a MUCH better mood this time.

I gave this place only 2 stars for the cranky counter boy.  But, the trucks were clean and neat.I don't know what to think of this place. Had a windshield replaced. The rear view mirror fell off- no problem. They reapply the gule and metal piece used to anchor the rear view mirror- no problem. They tell me to wait til the next day to put the mirror back on- no problem. I wait til the next afternoon and it falls off again- no problem. I take it back in and they tell me I NEED TO FIX IT MYSELF- they tell me to go buy some windshield apoxy and do it myself- I was stunned.
They were all so professional and helpful up to this point. Fix it myself... really?
That's your customer service- go fix it yourself.The other half and I settled on this place the other nite b/c we couldn't find the other Chinese buffet we were searching for.  After about an hour's drive, we looped back toward CenPho and pulled in here instead.  I had a bit of trepidation but you know I love me some ghetto Chinese buffet.  We'll, that's exactly what I got.

The selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The "lo mein" was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.

I think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.

On a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.

I doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.  At the top it reads, "Great Dragon Buffet presents the THANK YOU". 

Well, thank you GDB!I go to red Robin a few times a year with the kids at their request, and usually have decent experience with the food and service. This particular burger treck was done as a result of a free burger offer for my son's 15th birthday.

After the experince of my husband's meal and my own...I have decided that burger's are the ONLY choice here for me personally.

The husband ordered the salmon fish and chips and was pealing off the mushy and greasy batter after the second bite. After doing this we almost could not tell if this was salmon or some breed of white fish...it was so pale and lethargic we were not even sure it was salmon...however we were assured by our server it was legit. I tried a bite it was not good at all.

I ordered their "steak" sliders. Upon taking mu first bite I almost ripped out my 2 front teeth. Not only was the meat full of grissle, bit the taste and texture of the meat made me gag. These were not edible and I asked our server for a replacement (which he did gladly) and was told by the server that this happens a lot with sliders ( the grissle). My alternate was a cheeseburger with bleu cheese ( this was fine). 

This was not a horrible experience, I just will stick to their burger menu in the future.

P.S. The visit was also made more exciting by a female employee sitting at their of the restaurant crying hysterically for about 10 minutes and then proceeded to curse out someone on her cell phone !!It was easy to get a seat, considering it was on a weekday night and the place was virtually empty. The atmosphere is inviting and cultural, with a comfortable vibe and color everywhere. The booth we were at even had its own little television to watch! I really like the decoration of the place, it definitely invites you into the experience.

Unfortunately, the food was bland at best. The bean dip with chips was okay, but the two other sides of what I thought was salsa and spicy salsa were too watered down and bland. Even the chips themselves didn't have any real kick or substance to them. I ordered the plan bean burrito, in which the rice was very bland and a little mushy. The burrito itself was nothing exciting, and I only ended up finishing half of my meal (and not taking the rest of it home with me).

My boyfriend ended up finding a long, thick black hair in his food. We immediately told the bus boy, and while it took the manager a good minute to head over to our table, she was nice enough on removing the item from the bill. Our server also gave us a free margarita in place of it. While having a taste of the margarita (and minding they made that margarita kick!), their server either forgot to card him or felt obligated to get him his drink for free. Either way, there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have asked for ID in a town like this. That automatically wanted me to drop this review down to a one star.

My conclusion is this place draws you in with the decor and beauty of the atmosphere, but it doesn't make up for the food. Ricardo's has a lot of potential if they offered new menu items if they decided to revamp what they already have with more flavor. Otherwise, I'd pass on this place.I give it two stars cause the food was tasty but the service and the price trickery, the servers and attitude sux.
Has great potential.I wasn't very impressed with my service when I was there. I didn't wait long to get in but I didn't feel the nurse did a through check when I went in for my yearly. To get a doctor I would have had to wait over a month so I took the first available. She wasn't a doctor so I am not sure if that makes a difference but I didn't find her friendly or helpful and she took less than 3 min in total with me. I felt she was rushed and I have had much better experiences with other Obgyn's in the valley.  I wouldn't recommend this facility.A few posh friends of mine came down to visit and for some strange reason they wanted to see the Fremont Street Experience. I only say strange because these are the kinds of friends who feel at home in places like the Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian. Apparently, they saw a Vegas special on the Travel Channel and thought the Fremont Street Experience would be a "delightful" place to visit. 

I tried my best to convey to them that the Fremont Street Experience and Downtown area aren't exactly the nicest of areas. The majority of the people there aren't the same people who are staying at the Bellagio... Or at a nicer property on the Strip. I told them them they shouldn't expect to see any of their fellow Baccarat players there. Against their better judgement, they were insistent on seeing the place... and really who am 
I to stop them. Onward...

About a 8-10 minute drive from the Strip, we head into the Downtown area. I always park at the California Hotel and they validate, up to four hours, if you stamp your parking ticket near the casino cage. Otherwise its about $1 an hour or something. We head out the door and start walking that one block to Fremont Street.

Right outside the door is a homeless guy begging for some change. My friends seem a little unfazed since there are tons of homeless people begging for change in San Francisco. About half a block down, we see another vagrant asking to borrow a dollar. A friend cheerfully tells them that he just lost all his money to the casino and wanted to know if he could borrow a dollar so he can win it all back. A little classless but hilarious since we were somewhat tipsy.

We get to the Fremont Street unscathed and started walking towards the Plaza. If you've never been to the Fremont Street Experience, its a large covered canopy that links several smaller hotel/casinos together along several blocks. On the ceiling plays a light show every hour. Sometimes there are people performing or street vendors selling goods.

Tonight we got to see the Globe of Death, in which up to three motorcyclists drive around inside the steel globe in a uniform fashion without crashing. We continue to walk towards the Golden Gate Casino when this happens...

"Oh no, I dropped my sweater.", says the female friend.

We turn around and retrace about 20 steps before we see it. And when I say "it" I don't just mean the sweater, but the strange scene in front of us. We see a burly African American man, who's probably homeless, pick up the white small sweater/cardigan and shoves it under one arm. He then proceeds to take off his ratty t-shirt, lays it on the ground, and then starts to fold the shirt like as if he was working at the Gap. He ever so gently places the t-shirt in his sack and then starts to put on the sweater/cardigan. Did I mention he was a big burly man, (180+ lbs) putting on a SMALL sweater? He totally stretches it out while trying to squeeze into it. He gets it on and now starts to zip it up. He gets about 1/4 way up and cant seem to zip it up any further. He looks down, happily satisfied, picks up his stuff and walks away.

The bunch of us stood there speechless for about 2-3 minutes trying to process what just had happened. Questions raced in our minds asking ourselves if we really did see what really just happened. A friend broke the silence with, "So do you want me to ask him for your sweater back? He looks like a nice guy." The female friend just shook her head in disbelief and we just started walking again.

We visited Binions, Golden Nugget, The Fremont, and the Four Queens. We got to the point where the Fremont Street Experience ended and the Fremont East area begins. Now the Fremont East area isn't as nice as the Fremont Street Experience. Instead of being in the middle, you are now on the regular sidewalks. The atmosphere goes from bright touristy to a little shadier. 

I ask if they want to continue down this road on towards the El Cortez and whatever else was down there. "I guess it doesnt hurt to check it out.", someone answered. Ooooooookay. We get about 40 steps in and like a scene straight out of COPS, a police cruiser pulls over a vehicle and two more cop cars come blaring in from the other side as to surround the suspect car. Needless to say, my posh friends did an immediate 180 and started walking really fast back to safer FSE. I was walking behind them trying to hold my laughter and the best way to describe my feeling is that jingle bells line that goes "LAUGHING ALL THE WAY HA HA HA."

Afterwards, we headed back to our car and the evening was nearly over. My friends were eager to get back to their hotel suite to shower away the grimy feeling they felt. I think one of my friends summed up the whole night best when he said, "The Travel Channel lied to us."Not a bad place to grab a drink if price is your concern. Food menu is slim and nothing was that good. We ordered:
sweet potato fries - good flavor, a bit limp, nice honey dip
onion rings - crispy, fried part fell off of the onions
spinach artichoke dip - liked the taste of it but there were HUGE artichoke chunks that were too big to eat

Popular place for karaoke, or at least it sounded like it.This is the 2nd time we visited Shish Kabob House. The first time, the service was really slow. We thought it might be different, so we came back a second time and the service was worse.

We had reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away, but we sat there for 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order. We finally ordered 3 hummus & pita, 2 Greek salads, and two Kabob Platters (beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken lula kabob, beef lula kabob, rice , French fries.) They ran out of pork kabob. 

We finally got our water, hummus and pitas, and the Greek Salads, but we couldn't eat our salad because we didn't have any plates or utensils. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get our plates and utensils.

The food is pretty good, but I don't recommend going to this restaurant if you value good customer service. Unfortunately, we don't plan on coming back.Ok... so up front.. this is for the Cox Pavillion...   I know I could go and get a point for a new place.. .but they are right next to each other.. probably have the same street address, and frankly don't care all that much..

this place was ok... granted the arena next store had a basketball game in it that might have been drawing all the man-power, but this was just ok...  I was here for a volleyball match... the team I was there for won(sorry UNLV)

I was sitting and smelled nachos... looked around and saw a guy with them... but he was squeezing the rest of the nacho cheese out of a package!!!!  I'll pass.Egg works did not "Work-out" too well for me ;-/ Which Is a shame because I love LOVEEEEE breakfast....I can have It for lunch, dinner you name It. I Imagined this place to be near "Mind-Blowing" because I had heard many great things about It but to my disappointment It was not up to par. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash meal to go, service was speedy so I do have to give them that but the staff did seem to be  too busy talking amongst themselves to greet properly, The one girl who took my order was a bit snooty. 

My hash was not good, It had a really strong beef taste like they had just taken It off the cattle and the eggs had a rubbery texture to It., Not at all what I expected :-(The room itself was very big and spacious. It is easy to see why many families would choose to come here for vacation. The lazy river was awesome on a hot day and the big pool is relaxed and heated, so it is not freezing cold when you go out in spring. My only major issue with this resort was the service. Every night there were too many people for how many buses. And the bus drivers, particularly the asian man who drove nights was rude. And he would show up to the stops 5-10 minutes before the pick up times and he would stay the entire time even if the bus was completely full and there were 10-15 people standing outside of the bus... This happened every night that I went out. And on last pick up time there was ALWAYS people left at New York New York and the mirage. One night my boyfriend and I had to take a taxi because there was no room for us on the bus and one night we were picked up at the mirage and there was only 3 seats open for passengers one man told me he had walked to the mirage from New York New York because the bus before was also full. another night we saw a party of 7: 3adults and 4 children  were left at New York New York, many of the children very young and already falling asleep. The excuse that was given was always that this is a free service. Even though this is a free service, it is unfair that large families have to spend so much more money just to get a taxi back to the hotel where they have most likely already paid for a few rooms. 

Another issue I had with service was that I like to be warm when I sleep so I called the first night I stayed to get a blanket sent to my room. No one ever came. It is a good thing I had brought a sleeping bag. The following night I called the front desk again and then no one sent me a blanket so I walked to the front desk and asked if I could get a blanket they told me that they would have one sent to my room because they do not have any at the front desk. I went to my room and an hour later I still hadn't had received a blanket so I called another time and finally half an hour later I received a blanket.After seriously giving up on the Rancho location (which is only a mile away from work), thought I would try this location (2 miles away). 

Ok, I don't know what's with Wells Fargo, but they don't seem to get customer service. No matter what branch I go to, they are ALWAYS short in tellers. There always seems to be an issue when I come here. The systems are down, not enough tellers, the really slow teller I seem to always end up with, the business line takes just as long, they don't have change. Never ending list. There are however, 2 tellers that I have become acquainted with who are fast and friendly, Pariese and Carlos. Thank you guys for making my trips bearable. Kudos to you guys, but seriously Wells Fargo, when will you step up?I would like to thank the smog tech for farting in my car before he got out and rolled the windows up. Other than this I'd say they have quite fast, can't say friendly service because everyone looked miserable and only said the things they had to, but then again how long does it really take to get a smog? Would have had 5 stars but my car smelt miserable after I got it back, staff don't greet you like a normal business should, you just get the "hey, what you need?" I paid, the tech have me my receipt then called the next person. No thank you, have a nice day, see you next time, thanks for coming, we appreciate your business. I assume jiffy lube corporate reads these so take those example phrases and utilize it in some training. Second, maybe you should pay your staff more they really look miserable at this location......Thanks for the gift (fart)!!I'm sad to say that I'm looking for another Dr.s Office.  I wanted to love this place because it's close to the freeway and it's a primary care and urgent care all in one and the wait times are typically reasonable.  Unfortunately, my husband had several bad visits and I had a few not so stellar and so we are looking elsewhere.

I don't want to name Dr.'s by name, but our PCP Dr spends very very little time with you and has a terrible bedside manner.  The wait to see him usually isn't too bad, but once he gets in the room, he is in and out in 2 minutes or less and you feel like you just paid a copay to get free samples (with no instruction how to use them) or the referal or blood work orders or wherever he's sending you off too.  Neither my husband or I are complicated cases, but I think at least 5 minutes and a little conversation about your health should be given by a PCP. 

The process of getting a referal takes way longer than it should and the office ladies seem overworked and stressed and the phone often rings a while before being answered.  I also don't like that the nurse or the MA's take a pulse ox every time you visit.  Even when you're not ill.  That is unnecessary billing of the insurance when you aren't sick and just had it done a month prior.  Also, a man under 30 should not have a BP of 140/90 and he was told BP was good.  

The final straw was when we had to visit the urgent care side of this office on a Saturday.  The doctor was pretty advanced in age and hardly listened to my husbands current complaints and spent time looking into an old injury that was completely unrelated to the visit.  He gave him meds for his terrible sore throat that do no work at all.  He gave essentially water jelly for the terrible pain.  Wasn't even asking for pain pills, just a stronger anti-inflammatory than Advil.  Not impressed.  Next day, the pain was way worse and there's no way we are going back to this urgent care.Not good... Bad service, the food is not gpod, my pasta was so sweet... Anyways I vote that this restaurant gets into kitchen nightmare series by Gordon Ramsey!!!! Enough said, skip this placeOK so I stop in. I need 2ea Falken 452 DT = Discount Tire we have them will order. Paid in FULL layaway. Tires should be here by Thursday. Ring ring Monday AM from DT sorry those tires are discontinued. OK what's the plan? I can get you the newer Falken 453 OK. Same Price! They will arrive Thursday or Friday FEDEX!  OK. Ring ring 1pm Thursday me calling DT just checking to see if my layaway tires arrived.  Not yet. OK.. Friday me calling again 1pm - Not yet.  Maybe Monday.  OH!  Can't wait need tires for trip. OK so we have another brand we can provide OK. Arrival on Saturday well the tires we had arent here. However we do have these tires for the same price. But wait we don't have those tires either. OK so we have other tires we can install Saturday.. WOW its almost over... We'll need an extra $23.00 to add to your drama. OMG!  Get me out of here... OK so I have the other other other tires on the car Saturday afternoon.  Monday 9AM ring ring its Discount Tire - We have your tires Falken 453.  Aaaah guys you installed the YOKO's remember. Returned the YOKO's today as they didn't have a matching pair for the rear FULL Refund.  Its finally over. Good times at DT.Seriously!  I went out of my way to eat here?  My husband and I stayed in Las Vegas for 3 nights when he had a work conference.  We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.

During our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!

The waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.

The best part of the experience was standing on the bar balcony after dinner.  We would not go back!It's just "OK".

We were seated very quickly which was Great.
We ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....

The waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.

Thankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.

Food was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  

Had the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.

I probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one.Why do I have to constantly ask for bread? It's complimentary, and I always see everyone else eating it around me. Is it just me? Service here is hit and miss, and mostly miss. I've had very rude waiters who deserved no tip from being extremely hostile and snotty. There's no reason to freak out on people over how they order- if you can't handle that, find a different job.
Their food is NOT New Orleans style or themed- yet the place is crawling with Mardi Gras decor. 
The food is overpriced for what you get- and it isn't that great. The best thing they have, for me, is their grilled cheese sandwich. What makes it good is that they grill Parmesan cheese on the outside, giving it a nice crunch. But I can make that at home, and make it less greasy too. 
My poor boyfriend had the luck of getting screwed over by a waiter (the last time we ever went to Mimi's). He had a coupon, and gave it to her- she never applied it. So it is useless to sign up for their e-club, since they never really send you good deals (just junk mail) and don't apply it.Don't leave anything in your car when you drop it off.  You will not get it back.  I rented a car from Hertz for a road trip.  The pick up was smooth and the car was great, albeit dirty.  One the way to drop the car off, I stopped and picked up 2 six packs of beer.  I dropped the car off and before I could get into the car with my ride, realized I had left the beer in the back seat of the rental.  I went back to where I dropped the car off and they brought the car around.  No beer. At this point, it had only been 10 minutes since I dropped the car off.   I went to talk to Randy, the most unhelpful manager in the history of the world.   Randy assured me he would take care of it and kept me waiting for 15 minutes.  When he came back he said that either no one had seen it, or it had been thrown away.  He said this over and over again.   Well, what was it Randy? Did it get thrown away or had no one seen it?   Regardless someone at Hertz was drinking good that night and Randy was full of it.Went here on 12/28/13. Had a Thai Ice Tea. Didn't taste right. Would never go back here for the Thai Ice Tea. Not sure about the food though.I want to start by saying that I get chain pizza isn't exactly gourmet... It's mass produced and missing that extra love that most mom and pop places provide.  But, chain pizza serves a purpose.  It's nearby, offers coupons, and if you're lucky it can taste good too....  So for reviewing Papa John's, please keep in mind that I'm not comparing it to a regular pizza joint.

That being said, I've had Papa Johns for years - from my old home of Pittsburgh to my new home of Las Vegas.  I always found it pretty consistent and liked the garlic sauce to dunk my crust in.

Flash forward to the last couple times I have ordered from them: really thick doughy dough (is that possible?), too much cheese, and on one really bad occasion we got canned tomatoes as a topping.  Worst of all, there's been meat lurking under the cheese like paparazzi trying to get a picture of Suri Cruise.

Ok ok, I get it.  Most people eat meat.  Eating out is a risk anyone that has dietary restrictions takes.  Ok!  Seriously, I said I get it!  Geeze.

Anyway, this has happened to us the last three times we've ordered Papa John's (this location in particular, the only one we order from).  It's always multiple pieces of meat, different varieties, and under the cheese.  So even after thorough inspection of the pie, you will bite into it.  Maybe someone doesn't like vegetarians?  Hmmmm.

I know most people won't understand, but it's seriously gross to me.  I don't think it should be that hard to keep meat off a veggie pizza.  Places like Chipotle and Zaba's do it without any problems.  Other pizza places don't have this problem.

I'll give the place two stars to try to be fair considering I used to eat Papa Johns occasionally before these shenanigans started happening.  But the quality and customer service has really gone downhill and leaves this girl with a big frowny face.I''ve been to this store twice and have been unable to get what I wanted.  It was difficult trying to find staff to ask a question.  

There are so many other places that are stocked with many more things.  There's also the little thing called the internet.  There's really no reason to waste my time here anymore!\

And this is a Sears Grand?  That's surely misnamed!I purposely mentioned when making my reservation that it was our anniversary and we would like a booth. The hostess walked us to a table way in the back, and when i mentioned that i had requested a booth, she got an attitude. I asked if we could wait for one to be made up, and she stated "i have one all the way up front by the door" and had some snarky remark yet again. Fine dining and hospitality? The food was outback quality at best. The filet literally tasted like a BK burger, and no one checked on us until we were half way through. Also, the table next to us was asked if they were celebrating anything. We were not, even though I mentioned it upon making the reservation.  So if you're celebrating something, hit the strip.The food is undoubtedly good for fast food Chinese, but they do this thing that gets me every time.  They have the menu designed in such a way that it LOOKS like your drink is included as part of it (1. Get Side 2. Pick two entrees 3. Get Drink) but they charge you extra for the drink, and Egg Roll is NOT a side, so they charge you extra for that.

Its better knowing all this, but it keeps me from raving about it.  I'm sure the prices here are more expensive because its in the Venetian too. 

All in all, pretty decent, but there are a lot of choices near by that I probably enjoy better.Pros convenient location, free shuttle to Manday, free internet , free breakfast, in room coffee.

Cons. Small room, thin walls( could hear the neighbors every word  on their phone, and they weren't yelling) rubbery eggs at breakfast, noisy room air conditioner .

You have to chose what's important to you. I'll pass on this property next time.Meaty wings, bland sauces. I don't like a whole lot of spice on my wings, so ordered the mild and the garlic parm, but still expected SOME flavor...not so much. I made my own sauce and tossed the wings in them- much better. Good quality chicken. Avoid the fries.Typical dive. My husband and I had an issue at the bar because some drunk shouted at my husband and when I responded, the bartender tried to rip my coffee out of my hand, essentially assuming I would be throwing it at him, which was NOT the case. I got the overwhelming feeling that they side with the drunken loser regulars instead of normal, responsible people who stop by. Every person affiliated with the ownership is a lush.Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about 200 decibels.  And, of course, 300 decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Coco's, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever I'm involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldn't be a problem.

I would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.

I asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back 5 minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didn't hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.

End result...not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered.This place has definitely gone downhill since my usual visits years ago. Their menu is constantly changing and it's so big you'll spend at least 10 minutes just looking over what you want. The food is sub-par compared to other places that serve the same type of food. Heck, P.F. Chang's just across the way is much better and you pay only a few dollars more, but the statement is true "you get what you pay for" and this location definitely proves that everytime.does Vegas have the worst cusotmer service or what, when it comes to hotels. We requested 2 rooms to be joined together 3-4 months in advance. We get there and they are not even close to each other. We complain and it doenst get us anywhere, they just didnt care. While we where complaing at the counter the guy next to us is yelling at the other lady because he had reserved a room and they said they didnt show it and he said he isnt going anywhere until they get him a room, WTF. I really like the rooms, its bad that service is so bad. When we goto hotels we always put the DND sign on the door because we dont want people in our room when we are not there, well there wasnt a sign and we requested that they bring us one and to just put in in the door. We get back and our room is cleaned up etc and no sign on the door. horrible.Room : I booked PH for a girls trip with three friends. Booked the hotel in Feb for the mountain view room. When our check in finally came PH did not have my room available. We needed to have two queens non smoking and told our options were limited. We ended up getting the resort room over looking the pool on the 10th floor. 
Not a bad room and it was pretty big. To compensate us at check in they gave us spa discounts and peep show 10.00 off (which BTW were worthless)

Pool: The pool at PH is BADDD I mean for here in Maryland the pool would have sufficed but this is Vegas... The only good chairs you had to pay 25-50. When we tried to lay out in the crappy free ones we were treated like second class citizens. Went over to the Hard Rock pool and they treated us much better and we were not even staying there. 

Maid Service: We never got any for FIVE days. I complained and they still never showed up 

Location: The reason I gave two stars. GREAT location on the strip. 

All in all it is a fun hotel the casino rocks and it is happening with a good crowd on Friday and sat night. But the hotel is not good. They really need to make changes if anyone is going to stay and come back. I sure won't......I drove by this location and almost kept going. However once again I was in the mood for Mexican food and decided to give this place a try. The restaurant itself is rather outdated, trip hazards everywhere as you walk from one level to another to another. A pretty dated restaurant.

I ordered what else, a burrito. Again what is it with all meat inside and nothing else...after a while you really want more favorable tastes. Oh well, another restaurant bites the dust when it comes to burritos. Maybe try something different if I am in the neighborhood.Kinda ghettoI went here based on the good reviews and I was so dissapointed! Being an ex Nyer I was dying to find a good deli .This is not it. Now, it is pretty inside with cool, faux, brick walls and an archway that reminds me of a cheesy Italian place back east so my heart went pitter patter when I saw it. I did not have an artisan sandwich nor did I see one on the menu. This place is under new ownership  so perhaps they changed the menu.I kept hearing about how big the sandwiches were but mine was not( 6inch hero roll more or less) . I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it  was not good at all. I ordered a side of potato salad and it tasted like a cheap grocery store brand. No way could it have been homemade. Oh well the search continues. ( Just wish Cassellas was closer to me) Perhaps I didn't order one of their speciality items. Help me out here and recommend a good sandwich here and I will go back and try it. No tuna please, yuk! This is the second time I have eaten here and both times the meal was not good.No thanks.

Deduct one star for the cheesey Hawaiian shirts.

Deduct one star for the salty deli meat on the club sandwich.

Deduct one star for the burger patty that was clearly frozen and not made fresh.

Deduct one star for the lack of appetizers (don't know why this bothered me since I didn't want one anyway).

Granted, we didn't come for breakfast, so I'll give them a star back.this is a tough one.  i am not a sweets person.  but i did go in because its sprinkles and people made such a big deal about it.  my first question to the employee behind the counter was "  what makes your cupcakes so special? "  she had no answer.  after a few grunts and huffs and puffs she said they were made daily.  to me that does not justify a 5 dollar cupcake.  had she said organic ingredients or any answer with some confidence i might have a different feeling.  i guess with the building rent you have to raise the price.  so yea the food.  it was mediocre at best.  its just a cupcake people.I don't know what disappointed us more here: the service or the food?! Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.

We presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server. 

Bread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made. 

Overall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers.We are regulars here. The San Francisco fire is amazing! All the rolls are amazing. The downside is their policies are rigid and tend to make the experience not so great. It's next to a sbux and you CANNOT bring in coffee, but they also don't offer coffee. Their iced tea is low quality and not good. The apple saki is amazing though! They are sticklers for the late night special. Everyone MUST buy a drink, even if 3 out of 4 are drinking alcohol, they will penny pinch you (we are talking the difference of a dollar!). We in fact love this place but management definitely needs to change their policies.Pros:
Inexpensive.
Nice decor.
LOTS of Shrimp.
Better than the majority of the ungodly terrible buffets of Fremont St.
There's never much of a line.

Cons:
The room is weird, why are the buffet and cafe attached?
There really isn't ever a whole lot going on. Very average, traditional American food. I would have at least expected some Hawaiian offerings seeing how popular the place is with Hawaiians.

I would only recommend this buffet if you had an insatiable taste for something overwhelmingly average. If not, you can do much better.I like this place cause I used to go here as a kid with my family. I remember liking the Crab Leg night, but I went back recently on a regular night and it felt kind of sad. The sushi was terrible. I liked the mashed potatoes and the cream sauce chicken, that's about it. The waiters are terribly slow, too!A very below mediocre cafe that people probably go because they are too hung over or there is absolutely nothing else to eat.  Came here with a huge party right before they closed at 2pm.  The service is really slow here and  you'll have to ask for everything twice, that is if you can flag down a waitress and get their attention, but they were nice, just not very attentive. 

The food is not impressive at all.  My pancakes were were dry and I asked for soft scrambled eggs, which still came out looking like regular scramble.  I also ordered a plate of steamed vegetables, you know, so I can eat my veggies for the day.  Little did I know that the whole plate of veggies are completely doused in butter that glistens so much that I can see my own face.

Unless you really have to, there so much good food in Vegas, I'd go elsewhere.Liked the ambience. Pretty typical college town pub with enough TVs to catch a game from most tables.Plenty of room and not overly crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Good beer selection, but no listing of brews on tap and too many for our waitress to remember. She recommended a seasonal brew that sounded good, and was, but 10% ABV! Print out a beer list that at least shows alcohol content, brewery, and style of beer! Ordered a pizza. Ugh mistake, $17 for a 12 inch with doughy crust and what looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog as sausage. The happy hour burger deal was excellent however and the burgers were quite good. Just having a listing of their beers would get them another star.I REALLY wanted to like this place!  Good location, good sports decor, large cheap pitchers, and bar sports (pool, darts, foosball, scuffle board), but alas, I did not.

I have to agree with some (most) of the other Yelpers when I say the service was subpar.  Usually I can handle poor service if the food is decent (I know, I know, it's bar food) but even for bar food, it wasn't very enjoyable.  I mean, HOW on EARTH do you mess up a cheese crisp and chicken tenders?!?    

We may go back for a late night foosball game and a health dose of beer, but as far as dinner, drinks and sports.... I sadly say, head across the street to Zipps.You're better off walking a couple blocks East and going to Jordan's.  Way better sports bar atmosphere, better deals, more bar games and waaaaaay better food.  Lucky's is a sad shell of the former Oakcrest, which was always a favorite in the neighborhood.  There is the occasional good drink special and the food can be hit or miss.  All the stadium area bars have their niche, but I can't name one thing that Lucky's does really well.  Yet, even though I don't have anything good to say I can't really badmouth it too much either. It is just kinda bland, boring and wholly mediocre.I am really very forlorn at having to give Chompie's a 2 star-er. This place has been my go to weekend breakfast spot for years. Hello, day drinking begining at 7am on game days?? You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them "to go" 

But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling..."Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.

Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down. 

Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. "Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me. 

She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp. 

5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?
 15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird. 

I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.

Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place. 

Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit.I've only been here a couple of times. I went on a Thursday night where its supposed to be industry night. If you get on the guest list you and your guest receive a pass and a wrist band that allows you to receive free champagne from 10pm-12am... not bad. If you're a big fan of techno, then this is where you wanna be on a Thursday night. Only thing is, THERES NO DANCE FLOOR, I would not call this place a Nightclub but more of lounge with no where to sit unless you have a reserved table or you go outside in the patio. What I saw that night was a bunch of people standing around talking and a few drunk ones "dancing" to bad music. I would suggest going somewhere else or perhaps come around 1am when they start playing the top 100's. 

**I heard they have Latin nights on Sundays** but I have yet to experience that night.Okay, this review is service related and is not a reflection on the beer they brew at the Ale Asylum.  I actually love the beer.  

The service at the Ale Asylum is some of the worst I have ever experienced...any where.  Out of five servers working on a busy Saturday evening, three acted like customers were annoying them to order anything.  Even after the rush died down, one bartender in particular would stand at the spickets across the room and flail his arms at the few customers remaining as if to say, "hurry up and order already!"  This experience was not limited to me, there were others in my group that had the same impression.  One female server was actually mocking various people as she walked behind them, in plain view of other customers!  This was all before 8:00 p.m.  

The bar is basically located in warehouse next to an airport and has a terrible internal traffic flow when crowded.  If you are over 25, save yourself the aggrivation of being treated as if you are blessed to be served and buy their beer in a local store.The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location.My wife and I went here a while back and wont go again! She had a burger that was OK. I was the one that had all the problem! I ordered the fish with the side of mac. and the oyster sampler. The oysters were good but way over priced for the 8. My food got there at last and the fish was around a 3 oz portion which the waitress pointed out that I had a bigger portion coming! Why the hell would they even send it out if it wasn't right? I at my two bites of fish and while I was waiting for the rest of my missing fish I try ed the mac. I was old and dried out. I sent it and they brought me another portion that was nearly as bad. By this time my wife was finished with her food and I still waited.I finely got the attention of one of the wait staff (I hadn't seen my waitress for a while) and asked when the rest of my fish was coming? No one knew what I was yalking about. They hunted down my waitress, the girl who brought me the skimpy order and the manager. By the time it was all straightened out we were ready to leave. They comped the fish but for the burger and the oysters and a couple of beers the bill was still over fifty! I wont be back! 

I have to now give praise to the Fish House! I first posted my thoughts on a food blog and never had a response. Once I posted on Yelp I received several e-mails all from different individuals voicing their concern about my experience at Kings! I have to say that my opinion has changed drastically about this establishment! If I get a response of concern like this from just my complaint I feel that they really do care about everything related to their establishment and have to give them cu dos and high marks! I will continue.....I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design, creepy constant music, the fact that the mall's outdoors, terrible parking lot planning....

Oh. And it shoots lasers.

Seriously.

Lasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under "overdone design."

I have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here, though. There are a lot of teens, but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe I've just been lucky.The staff was friendly.  The food was okay.  Salsa was acceptable.  We sat in the dining room across the courtyard, which is what really ruined the meal.   It was difficult to enjoy anything in a room with such an over powering smell of mildew.The 'burlesque' in the show was pretty limited. I was actually disappointed. The girls were attractive and talented dancers, but I really was anticipating at least a taste of Burlesque as the name implies.What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?????!!

I was stone-cold sober last night, I SWEAR. I went to see George Wallace, expecting a middle-of-the-road Vegas standup show. Some laffs, some audience participation, whatever. What do you expect for free tickets, ya know?

What I got was about 60 minutes of a cherubic relic in a pimp suit mumbling, slurring and stumbling through a bunch of dusty one-liners 
(sometimes his delivery was so bad, I couldn't understand what he was saying). There were a few jokes in really bad taste, though, about which he was totally unapologetic...so I did laugh at those.

But then, the show got WEIRD AS FUCK!

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the audience is mostly middle-aged black people. Now, I've seen Madea and Coming to America and all those movies that end with church scenes featuring gospel singers clapping and throwing up their hands and singing "O Happy Day" and shit like that -- I thought it was some bullshit racist Hollywood stereotype.

But I'm here to tell you: at end of his show, on a Wednesday night in Vegas, George Wallace asked all the ministers in the house to stand up -- astonishingly, there were 7 or 8 of them in there that night, so they all got up and passed the mic around, saying their names, where they were from, and what church they preached at:"The First African Episcopalian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ," stuff like that.  WTF!!! 

Now George Wallace cued some 80s gospel music, and handed the mic around again. This one guy down front started belting away in a majestic baritone, somehow knowing all the words without a problem. Was he a plant? Or do all ministers just know these songs, and happen to frequent the George Wallace show (other reviewers here describe this same thing going down)? 

Next, he invited another one of the ministers, this big spiky-haired woman, onstage. He told her if she could sing this next track, and really kill it, he would match all the money people in the audience threw at her. WTF?! He didn't say anything about it going to her church -- I guess she just got to keep the cash.
 
So he cued up another obscure gospel track, and she took the mic -- and started DOMINATING that song!! I thought for sure she must be a plant -- she'd been sitting in a booth with a bunch of much younger guys who had raised their hands earlier when Wallace asked if anyone was from Detroit, but she said she was from Henderson...plus, they didn't react like friends would when she was pulled up onstage. Definitely seemed plant-y.

But if that's the case, then what a scam!!! Because after she belted a verse or two, people in the audience started getting up and throwing cash at her!!! They came from all over the theater -- the back, sides, front -- and even my friend went up and gave her $5, so I know the money wasn't all fake. People were standing up in the aisles, waving their hands in the air like on those creepy megachurch broadcasts, singing along and praising Jesus. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night in Vegas, and most of them were drinking Mai Tais and shit!!!!! WTF!!!

If this lady was really a plant, she has a pretty sweet gig going there -- she probably made about $100 for her "impromptu" performance, which I assume she repeated the following night...and the following night. George Wallace said he would match the money after the show -- he said, "Come see me, and I'll give you $100." Hmmm. 

Now that I think about it...the theater was only about a third full, and as mentioned my friends and I had gotten free tickets, so who knows how many other comps were in there. He's probably not making much money, since he spent a good portion of the show hawking his merch -- he told people over and over to be sure and buy one of his signature "I Be Thinkin'" hats after the show, which were normally $30 but this night only, just for us, he was marking them down to $20. He also pimped his $100 package, which included 2 CDs, 2 DVDs, 2 t-shirts and 2 keychains. 

It came off as kinda swap-meetish, and pretty desperate...so that makes me wonder: is he splitting the take with this planted gospel singer???

Either way, even if she was for real -- that's pretty fucking weird, too! I mean, these people were throwing money at her like it was the Spearmint Rhino!! 

WEIRD show. I would recommend scoring free tix somewhere, then eating mushrooms 30min before it starts.

And if you do -- be sure to let me know if the same lady gets up and sings! She looked like a fat Fantasia Barrino, with short spiky hair and a toothy smile.While I was in Vegas for a long weekend, I decided to try the Tacone Flavor Grill. I had read the Yelp reviews and the place averaged 4 stars. I also found a certificate for this eatery on Restaurant.com. We were excited to try the place!

First of all, we weren't expecting a fast food place in a Mall. I'm not sure how I missed this when reading the Yelp reviews. Mind you, I don't mind eating in fast food places or in the Mall, if the food is decent.

My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla and french fries and I ordered a burrito with chicken. Both of us found it difficult to finish what we ordered. The french fries had a distinct odor of curry and the rice in my burrito tasted like it had saffron in it. This was like no Mexican food we ever tasted!

The food was inexpensive and with the Restaurant.com certificate, it was pretty cheap. I guess in this situation, we got what we paid for. :-(

Next time we go to Vegas, I won't be going back to the Tacone Flavor Grill.Didn't know how to use the yelp coupon offer. Chips were old and cold. "A" team is not working tonight. Ill give it another try some other time.I am spanish and was looking for a good tapas bar to remember the taste of home. Unfortunately, I found the icon a bit underwhelming. I was not expecting to walk right into a restaurant in the middle of Madrid and fully understand that some ingredients are hard/impossible to get, however, I was expecting more from this place. 
I like the style but found it to be quite uncomfortable for a party larger than two. 
Will probably give it another try at some point.I have no idea what the big hooha is about this place.
It's bland.. yes the portions are huge but what good does that do if it taste like...blah.?

The reason for the 2 stars.. the decor and service. Being in this restaurant reminds me of being in a hotel in Vegas. it was very grandeur and venetian like.  

I was here on a business trip and managed to spend my per diem of $55 easily. I had 2 martinis which I think was the best part of my meal.

I had ordered calamari to start and tuna tar tar. The calamari was soooo bland that my salt and pepper sprinkling did not help.. my co worker actually sent it back to the kitchen.. that's how bad it was. apparently it was old oil (as the manager came out and apologized as he then tasted our dish and agreed.. or so he says.)  
The braised ribs were delicious, tender and the meat completely fell apart in your mouth, unfortunately this is what my coworker had ordered. I, for some reason went with ....hmmm. it was that bad I don't even remember. I remember not finishing it. 
dessert was apple pie (idk what their fancy name for it was.. but all it is is baked apple pie) with a scoop of ice cream on it. big whoop

a disappointment for the price and what I thought I was gettingMy buddy and I went here for a quick lunch because we had a buy one get one coupon. Actually we had two of them. One came from the Entertainment Book and another I found on the website. We walk in and its lunch hour. It's busy. It's noisy. It's chaotic. The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. 

It comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, "If they are for our store then maybe." Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. 

"See? At participating locations only." 
"So I take it you are not a participating location?"
He just shakes his head no. 

Now, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? 

It just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. 

We were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. 

We get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible. 

My friend said his thing was ok but neither of us were really thrilled from the minute we walked in.So. I just got back from Vegas, and stayed at, of course.. The Palazzo.  Well, I must say.. couple months really did some damage to the casino.  Can't believe I'm going to give this place 2 stars but whatever has got to be done.

(1) Service just got horrible.  It went from a solid A to a very average C.  And trust me, average is not acceptable in Vegas. With all the competition they have, it was very disappointing experience this time around.  From the front desk to the casino credit, it was very just average.  Maybe even a little below for the price they charge you for room.

(2) Room was still big and comfortable as I remember. But can the cleaning service be upgraded?! If the room wasn't comped, I would've been even more mad... but because it was free, I can't complain that much right? But at $350/night regularly, it was quite annoying that the cleaning lady could not distinguish lotion between conditioner.  I was in the shower, shampooed my hair, great.  Time to condition my hair... but wait, what is this, the lotion? Since when did people lotion their body in the shower? Very irritating when it took me almost an hour brushing my hair just because someone can't distinguish between lotion & conditioner.  Also, I was looking for my glasses that I left on the nightstand for about an hour, only to realize that the cleaning lady decided to tuck it into the bottom drawer. (Even though I specifically told them not to clean anything BUT the bathroom). Ugh.

(3)  Gaming wise... wow. Must say, pit boss's and dealers got super unfriendly.  Maybe they've been running into some not-so-great players, but honestly, what's up with the service?  Here we go again on the service.  Unacceptable, especially when the Wynn & Encore is just a bridge away.

(4)  They charge you for an extra fridge and late-check out now. What? I know they're going bankrupt and all, but c'mon now. Are you really going to scare away your loyal customers so you can get a few bucks here and there?  I have never been charged for an extra fridge nor the late check out.  But this trip made me realize... The Palazzo really must be DESPERATE!

(5) They don't comp cigarettes anymore. Wow. What else are you going to take, free alcohol? The Pit boss told me that it was because of health issues and regulations.  I assumed that this was all of Las Vegas's new rule and thought it was quite dumb but still let it slide.  Next day, I went to the Wynn/Encore to play, and the pit-boss comped cigarettes like nothing.  I was confused.  I then told the pit-boss what the Venetian/Palazzo told us about the cigarettes and all he said was, "The Palazzo is still around" and laughed.  Seriously.  They're still around? They need to honestly up their game.

My loyalty has really gone down in the drains with this trip.  On the up side, theres always Wynn/Encore.King's Fish House is in a nice location at The District at Green Valley Ranch.  The design of the restaurant is nice, and it is a comfortable place.  

I have found the service here to be reasonably good.  However, I am not a big fan of the food - it is serviceable, but nothing remarkable.  Sushi is not worth ordering here as it doesn't compare well to sushi restaurants that focus on this type of cuisine.

Other dishes, including the fresh fish and sides, are ok, but, again, nothing remarkable.

I do like many restaurants at The District (Lucille's, Kennedy, Settlebello), but this one just doesn't offer anything of great interest of exceptional quality in my experience.I would have given it 3 stars. While their selection isn't huge, its offerings were enough since I was starving and would have eaten anything. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty.

Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. 

Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. 

And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy.

Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started. 

Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :(As much as I adore TI as a hotel, the buffet doesn't leave much of an impression on me. Maybe because I've waited too long to finally review the place, but I digress. The sushi selection was okay, but the rolls themselves were a bit dry. Their eggs benedict was average. I could actually whip out a better batch in my own home. I guess I'm spoiled, seeing as I've dined at the likes of Wynn and M Resort. Their buffets have no contest with TI's.Great atmosphere. This is a good place to go for a drink, but I'll never go back for sushi again. The sashimi was not especially fresh, the rolls were not memorable, and everything is overpriced. Even the happy hour menu was no good.I go to this theater a lot since it's close by but it is far from one of the nicer theaters in the Vegas valley. Although they'd recently remodeled and added a couple of giant screen, leather seat XD Cinemas, the regular auditoriums are very dated. Yes, they are stadium seating but the seats are old and very uncomfortable. Want to see a movie in one of the nice new auditoriums? Yep, that'll cost you some extra cash. 

The clientele at this theater is usually a bit "lower quality" than at other movie theaters in town. Expect loads of screaming babies in R-rated films and lots of talking obnoxious teenagers and folks being of the type where you wouldn't want to even LOOK at them cross-eyed answering their cell phones during the movie. I have never had a pleasant experience here. There's even a big ad that runs before the movie saying that if you text on your phone or talk during the movie that they'll kick you out. That's a big lie. I have had to get up several times during movies to go alert an employee and while they will come in the theater and stand around for a few minutes, I have NEVER ONCE seen them ask anybody leave -- even when the offenders were talking right in front of them. 

The absolute worst thing I have ever experienced was a few months ago when I went to see an animated movie. There was a (loud, talking) family behind me in the theater. During the movie, their baby started crying (of course) and they didn't take him out, they just sat in the movie while their kid wailed and wailed. Suddenly, I started to smell poop. It got stronger. Thankfully the movie was almost over. As soon as it ended, they walked out and I STILL smelled poop. I turned around to look and the mom had CHANGED HER BABY'S DIAPER DURING THE MOVIE and had LEFT THE POOP FILLED DIAPER STUFFED INTO THE ARMREST ON THE MOVIE SEAT. This will tell you the "quality" of the customers at this place. 

I try not to go to this theater unless I have to because management doesn't seem to care about the rude behavior of their audiences.I have an update, because as my lease is ending, I really need to say some things about this place.

I've officially been living her for a year. The grounds keepers/maintenance crew are the best, most humble people you will ever know. Regarding the office staff, seems like they want to turn a blind eye towards all the problems the good residents are complaining about, in order to keep the rioting college kids, who bring their friends every weekend. Besides the fact that there is construction going on in a warehouse behind the apt., they work 24/7, noises all the time...
I'll list the problems, that not only I've had, but that others have too.

1- We're trying to buy a house, instead of just letting us know that 'hey, your lease is almost up, you haven't been a problem resident, you don't have to pay extra to break your lease'; We were told that if we break our lease, we have to pay the months rent that we are living here, $1660.00 to break the lease, PLUS pay back the incentive we received when we moved here. What kind of B.S is that!? Needless to say, we're buying, moving and still paying rent here...and I will CONTINUE to use all their amenities (pool, movie theater, etc until my lease is up).

2- My hubby and I rent a garage, monthly, because there aren't enough parking spots for all the residents, because there are so many freakin' college kids/friends over, that residents have to look/scrounge for spots. Anyway, we rent a garage, expensive I might add, my husband likes working on cars, is knowledgeable, blah, blah.  I had the courtesy to ask the office, if he could work on my car, as it needed a new clutch, among other things. We were told NO. Ok, so I went ahead and paid almost $3000 to get my car worked on. Lately I've been seen residents change their oil, work on their cars and motorcycles (both in the garages AND in carports). So again I complained and I wrote the manager a LONG email about why its unfair, that they ignore these residents, but yet don't take into consideration that I asked, etc. They response was that they haven't seen anyone, so they cant say anything. B.S! I've even given them the license plates of the people working on their cars, no EXCUSES! Grrrrr!

3- Dog poop: this has been on going and on going. People here pay extra to have their dogs. Fine, I'm a dog person, love dogs, cant wait to get one. But if I did have one here, whenever my dog went out for a poop, I'd clean it up (the apt even provides the baggies). No, there's dog poop EVERYWHERE! Be careful if you are drunk, cant see well at night, etc because you will step on dog poop. You know who cleans it up, maintenance/grounds keepers, they aren't even the owners of the dogs!!! They keep a tally on who the owners are, the office has pics of the dogs that live in the complex, etc. and NOTHING is being done. These sick a$$ owners want a dog, but don't clean up after them... I can only imagine how disgusting their apts must be!

4- (And I swear this will be my last rant)- Drunken people: If you're going to live here, please be aware that you will feel like you're living in a dorm. I'm no longer at the point of my life where I want to be woken up by some drunk girl, crying because her boyfriend looked at another girl at the club, SHUT UP! The pool has hours from 7a-12a, people bring their friends over, drunk off their a$$es and those that live around the pool area, have to listen to all this, they complain to management and NOTHING is done about it. We even have a security guard, where is he? Sleeping in the office or his car? Management knows EXACTLY who these people are, because its always the SAME people!!!!!!! and do nothing about it. 

Ok, like I said last rant, I'm so over this place, too expensive, there are no more community events, as the budget was cut, now they want residents to pay for some guy to come and cook, it's like living in a dorm, and for every ignorant resident they have, they'll be loosing 3. Can't wait to leave!

(Sorry it was so long and the actual rating I want to give is 2.5 stars)Overpriced. Only went because we had a coupon.  Service was OK but not overly friendly either.  Definitely don't need to go back...Menu and management have changed so many times, it's hard to keep up.
Food has been awful, good, and back to disgusting currently. Not sure why the new manager changed the menu and mage it worse!
They get great bands but a lousy set up for live music, so caustics is always off and it's impossible to hear anyone talk unless you scream.
Staff is okay. It has not been the same since Amy left.
They crown can be seedy.The place has nothing to boast, other than being in a cute old house, that's it.

The beers are very expensive and the food sucks BOTH times we have gone there.

I will go back one more time as I have a 25% off coupon that includes beer, so we'll just have beer even though they have IPA only in the bottles and its about $1.50 more than most places.

I'd rather go to the George and Dragon honestly.They only have a few good instructors left at this gym, since most have left for better paying gyms. It has gone down the tubes in my opinion. The whole place needs a facelift and the management could care less. The only reason I keep my membership is because of the few teachers left that I love, it is über cheap, and I can use it when I travel. Clean it up...it looks like it came out of the Miami Vice days.I hate this place. The bartender who helped us with a total assuming jerk!

Spanish Steps may have a nice location on the strip, but I've been treated better.

I decided to stop here with my father, so we both could have a Diet Coke, which would be followed shortly by at least one beer for myself. It was a hot Tuesday afternoon this past May, the bar was uncrowded, and there were plenty of seats.

We both sit down at the bar, order the two soft drinks, and immediately the bartender proceeds to make the drinks in to-go cups. I didn't ask for the drinks to-go, nor did you ask if I wanted them to-go. My intention was to sit there out of the sun, enjoy the drink and after a couple of sips I would order a beer to accompany the soft drink, but nope, we apparently were unwelcome if we order only soft drinks.

The bartender hands us our to-go drinks, which basically is like saying "here you go, now leave" and tells us it will be $8.00.

WTF? I'm floored! $4.00 for a 16 ounce soft drink is outrageous!

Would I be complaining if we had been served correctly, been given refills on the soft drink and felt welcomed so I would've gotten my beer- absolutely not.

So we paid the tab, didn't tip the bartender a cent since clearly his level of service was on par with a fast food restaurant and walked on to another bar where I was treated right. Just a side note, but at the next bar I got another Diet Coke, but also drank three beers and on top of the 20% tip I gave on that bill I also handed the bartender the tip the idiot at Spanish Steps should've received for the $8.00 tab!

So basically, Spanish Steps you can shove it!I'm afraid I can't give this place more than two stars.  The service was attentive.  That's the one positive.  We came here because some friends of ours stayed at the Resort and had two entrees for the price of one coupons.  Thought, how can you go wrong.  I had the lobster bisque, tenderloin, and bananas foster.  The tenderloin came as just two slices of tenderloin over some average mashed potatoes and some side vegetable.  Others around the table also had the tenderloin.  One person had duck and another halibut.  We all came away with the same impression - highly amazingly overpriced for what you get.  Nothing special on the food.  I have had better steaks at lower prices in many locations.  Bill for my daugther and me (two appetizers, entrees, wine and a dessert) came to $170 and that was after the one entree free coupon!  There are so many interesting food choices in the Scottsdale area, I won't be back to this.I wish I could give this place more stars but- like everyone says its over price, slow service and the food is only ok. You are better off going to the Starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin.Seemed good-- but no! I ordered a taco salad, and it wasn't very-- hmmm... "mexican-ny." Pretty pricey, but what am I saying, it's Vegas. However, I thought it was bland and had less flavor than a jose ole frozen burrito! I'm from southern California, so maybe I expect a little more from mexican food-- but this was supposed to be authentic. With all the money they make in this city, would it kill them to have a professional-cultural-cook advisor?Eh.  It's entertaining.  You are paying for the entertainment with higher food prices for food that really isn't all that impressive.  

Not sure what's changed for me.  Maybe my taste buds have gotten wiser over the last 3 years.too loud!!!Went there for happy hour one time and have not been back since. 

Pretty medicore service. When it FINALLY arrived, some of our food was cold. Our server seemed like she had MUCH better things to do...god forbid I ask for a refill! Speaking of drinks, they were a bit overpriced considering how weak they were..although, maybe I'm a bit biased there.

I mean, they had just opened 2 months before but still....cold miso soup? Yuck.  Attitude? Yuck.

If you want a great sushi place, try Sapporo or Sushi Brokers.As a piano bar in Vegas, there are definitely better ones (Harrahs and New York New York). Stopped by twice and the singers/players each time were mediocre. No one was requesting and when we actually did give a request with money, they didn't play it for 45 minutes. I know what they were doing - they had our money so they wanted to keep us around. Boo hiss! 

Cocktail service was very good. It's the same bar menu as the rest of the Venetian and Palazzo.   Also serves the wasabi peanuts and kalmata olives at the table.

More of an older crowd in their 40s+. Bar closes at 1 am.Staff good! Decor is awesome! Food is gross & greasy! Salsa is the only good thing! I wouldnt go back!Every time I've gone to Red Mango, I have had a bad experience. Their mochi is always hard and the fruit is never really fresh. The flavor of the yogurt is also mediocre. 

I highly recommend Cefiore. You can taste quality in their frozen yogurt, and I'm all about quality! The prices are also very reasonable as well.Smelled horrible in this place.
There was a cook or waiter sleeping on one of the booths.
Food was solid but nothing special.I'm a fan of the embassy suites chain. Big rooms, nice buildings with large open atriums, free drinks at manager's reception and free cooked to order breakfast. 

I know embassy suites, I've stayed at embassy suites....embassy suites tempe, you are NO embassy suites.

Here are my gripes in order of priority:

1. Heating was broken and a call to the front desk resulted in a promise to "fix it right away" but no follow up action. My dad who stayed with us froze his tail off at night and felt sick all weekend. Shame on you embassy suites for failing to care for the elderly. (Yes it does get cold in AZ in the winter!)

2. The Garcia's in the lobby makes the entire lobby reek of oily food smell. Great way to introduce the hotel to new guests. Walk in and smell the tex mex. 

3. The service is ok at the front desk, but you are left feeling "on your own", much like a no frills hotel. I did not see "Embassy Suites Express" on the signage. The complex is huge, maze-like, and difficult to navigate. The front desk did not really help much with their directions to the room. My family was left wandering around far longer than they should have. This place is not like your traditional embassy suites with huge open air atrium. It looks more like a converted apartment complex.

4. The breakfast and happy hour area is just too small and cramped. I wasn't very happy when i can't even find a seat during happy hour.

5. The mini fridge did not work very well. It was barely cold enough to keep a drink lukewarm.

On the positive note, they did respond quickly to requests for extra towels and blankets. The furniture was new and clean. The bathroom and mini bar had granite tops. The gym was quite good with brand new equipment and TVs integrated into the elliptical and treadmills.

So there you have it. Stay there if you must, and try to hang out in the gym as much as possible.Meh...I went here for the Lakers game today.  They have appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and salads.  The O'Connell burger that I ordered, which had bacon was just so-so.  The fries were decent.  The Coors Light was a little flat.  Overall, just an average sports bar.  The crowd here seemed a little older.Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh but Kabuki hit the big fail button! Maybe my darling co-worker as well for not checking the order before bringing it back. A co-worker and I wanted to try it out for lunch and since it's in close proximity of our workplace, we said let's go. We called in our order, I had ordered the Bar-B-Que rib and tempura combo and she ordred the Gold Rush Roll and Vegetable Roll. When she came back, hers looked amazing and mine, well, wasn't what I expected. It was SALMON! How the hell do you get salmon and bar-b-que rib mixed up. And also there wasn't any tempura sauce in the bag. Being pressed for time, I sat there and gagged down the dry salmon (teriyaki sauce did nothing for me) and tempura. If there was a survey tip in the "Good for" that said nothing, I would put my check mark there.It has a cozy dining area that was easily able to seat our party of five. I'm no Thai expert, and the food was decent, but it was unremarkable. I had the beef pad thai (it was a toss-up between that and the green curry) which was greasier than I had anticipated. The service was friendly enough, but not very proactive on the beverage front.Had the Cuban sandwich. Not what I expected for a Cuban. I will need to try something else.FORGOTTEN...  Nothing too memorable about the setting, music, or people there.  I went for the first time on a sat night with some friends.  It was pretty empty given the large space.

As for the actual bar it had a Hip Hop section with tables and an open bar, a "techno/dance" room (void of any actual people), and an outdoor patio which was small and a bit crowded but housed all of the smokers for efficient second hand smoke intake.Food was average, service was bad overall with the exception of one server; Robert.  While I love Mario Batali, I think he needs to re-evaluate his staff.  We received attitude from two out of the three servers waiting on us.

One example, we asked for our salad to be split, and they brought the salad on one plate.  I asked again to have the salad split onto two plates, and the waiter looks at the other waiter and shrugs his shoulders up and down and says, "Ok, why not!"  That was such a rude response, and they acted as if we were asking for a custom meal and they were doing us a huge favor.

There's nothing worse than when you're paying a premium price for dinner, and the food is average and the service is bad.

Unfortunately, we will not be back.  Sorry Mario, I know if you would have seen the way we were treated, you would not tolerate that behavior from your staff.The location is the best thing about this place.  I know it is a chain but I expected much more.  The customer service from the hostess was good very pleasant and smiled the whole time.  the customer service from the waitress on the other hand was not up to par.  she seemed to be having a bad day.  My drink order was wrong that's an easy fix but then my meal was wrong too.  I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and got the thai chicken pizza instead.  I brought it to her attention but ate it anyway cause at this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.  I think I would give this place one more chance and update my review.As of recent I have been going to Einstein Bros Bagels rather than Brooklyn Bagel that's literally across the street from my place for their Salmon Lox on Asiago. Which at any other time, I would be pleased with the speedy service and toasted Lox. 

This time, I came for breakfast had a white chocolate mocha coffee, and bacon egg cheddar on of course my fave, Asiago bagel. White chocolate mocha coffee honestly tasted better than the Starbucks version. It wasn't too sweet and didn't make me stomach feel funny like how some Starbucks drinks make me feel. I took my order to go, so that I can make it back in time for a 12 hour overnight shift and of course there service was speedy like any other visit. But once I got to my shift, I was sadden that their service was tooo speedy they forgot my bacon and added cream cheese! Oh shucks. The bagel tasted soggy from the loads of cream cheese. It tasted like cheese overload.. Asiago bagel, a zillion layers of cream cheese and a slice of cheddar cheese -____- omg. When I make my own bagel sandwich at home.. I'm perfectly fine with ONE layer of cream cheese.This place used to be really great, like 5-6 years ago, when it first opened. It was the spot. My friends and I would be here every night we wanted to go out (if we weren't at the nightclubs on The Strip). Especially since they offered Hospitality cards - if you work in the "Industry," you present this card, outside of Happy Hour, and you receive a wristband that provides you with an instant 50% discount on drinks and food. Fabulous. The martinis are fun and, for the most part, delicious. The food isn't bad either. Most nights, the music was decent and dancing in the area near the stage was fun. Now, the crowd has certainly changed (or maybe my friends and I have changed?) and it's just not our scene anymore. The problem is that I don't think it's much of anyone's "scene" either. 

The service has been spotty as well. One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time, occurred on St. Patrick's Day in 2009. A particular bartender was unnecessarily rude and implied that I was going to leave the lounge without paying my bill by coming out from behing the bar and standing next to me the whole time we were paying. My friends and I were at the SAME table next to the bar for a couple hours and we didn't say or do anything that would have indicated anything! I have never been treated with such disrespect at any establishment as that day. I've been just a few times since then and it's been just okay. I'm not sure what makes all the employees think they're too good for their jobs and better than all their patrons, but it is beyond me.I SOOOO wanted to love this place.  We used to have this great Jamaican place around the corner in Chicago, and were really looking forward to those flavors.  They were very attentive when we arrived, and I thought, this will be swell.....  

Then we met our server.  This place is not very big and our server, who didn't seem to know what he was talking about (how's the fish, it's yummy.  how's the short ribs, so good.  not helpful), was LOUD.  He seemed really overworked which I cannot understand because there are only like 10 tables in the whole place and there were others working...

Starter - we had the Prawns and Roti.  They were amazingly good.  One criticism - when they say prawn, they just mean bigger than average shrimp. I understand this is common in certain areas of the US and the rest of the world, but the starter was slightly different than we expected.  Nonetheless, it tasted amazing.

We had the rum punch of the day to drink - VERY tasty.  I would go back just to have the "prawns" and rum punch.

Dinner - I ordered the short rib stew - their take on a beef stew, essentially.  It was VERY tasty.  Really, I could've eaten more.  No really.  I wish they had given me more.  The portion was smaller than I expected for the price.  The flavor was nice - and spicy - and amazing - but I still hadn't tasted anything that reminded me of the Jamaican food I had back in Chicago.  I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything, but...

Todd had the Mussels.  These should really be on the starter menu.  I'm not sure how someone can make a meal out of 10-15 mussels.  There's no side and two small pieces of bread.  Again, for the price, it seemed strange.  Also - while the mussels were tasty and wonderful, they were larger than normal, and neither of us cares for the larger mussels.

We were not thrilled, and for a birthday celebration, it was underwhelming, but we had a nice time (because the company was good).  I'm just not sure our experience was worth the money we spent.I love this food but the service is really lacking..  we come here at least once a month but the service is rarely good much less great..  Hey owners do you not read what your customers say??  Help us love this place by stepping up the service...  dont you want to keep loyal customers??  Help us help you..  READ what the customers say and make a difference!!!Lunch on December 26, 2011.  I had the shrimp po boy.  It was not bad, the portions were fine and there were steak cut fries that went with it.  The price was $16.  I was OK, but nothing to write home about.  I would not go out of my way to come here, but if you are hungry and want to get something on that side of the shopping area, it is ok to try.  You can at least say you tried one of Emeril's places.Table 10 did not meet my requirements for bomb Louisiana/Mississippi Delta food 

We went because its a Creole and Cajun place and I like that kind of food.  I stuck with the basic at a place like this: shrimp po boy.  A shrimp po boy is the cornerstone oof any legitimate Cajun spot.  Its not the the po boy was horrible just wasnt great. Too basic nothing stood out.  Not enpugh flavor for me.

We ordered the truffle mac since its a favorite of many people who come here.  Unfortunately, I had to compare this one to Boteros and there was no comparison.

On a positive note, Table 10 is not a 1 star, I just did not like the food and the service is a little slow.  I did like the decor, the wine cellar, the bar, so maybe I would have had a better experience If I was here for a drink, but I was here for lunch and it was a duece.I used to LOVE this place but in the last year, it's really gone downhill. I don't know if it's under new ownership but there's been a tremendous change with this business.. They are super pushy about trying to upsell you to the $40 'Happy Feet' pedicure and their waxing services. For a $40 pedicure, it's SO not worth it. It used to be when you would really get pampered with a long massage and hot rock treatment. Now if you get lightly rubbed for a few minutes, you can consider yourself lucky. If they can't sell you on 'Happy Feet' expect to be pushed and pushed on the individual services that comprise 'Happy Feet' like $5 callous removal, $5 big toe design, $5 massage, etc. and then pushed more for waxing services.The last few times my friends and I have been, our manicures smudged badly even after a good 15 minutes sitting under the blue light. I believe this is happening because they are adding nail polish remover to their nail polish to thin it out and make it last longer as I've seen them do on a few occassions. Another friend of mine stopped going to them after 3 of her tips peeled up within the week.The last time I went there (which will be my last time), the nail tech pushed and pushed to get me to do my eyebrows. Stupidly, I let myself be badgered into it and then she took off almost my entire eyebrow leaving me a tiny line!! This in spite of the fact that I told her repeatedly that I only wanted the middle and the strays on the bottom taken care of because I don't have much in the way of eyebrows in the first place! I had little 'Sharpie' style eyebrows for 3 months and they still haven't grown totally back.

For those of you who don't know, the Azul Day Spa across the parking lot is owned by the same people as Nails by Tina and the staff goes back and forth between the locations. Expect the same issues there but they charge more for their services at that location because it's a day spa.This is a standard coffee shop.  We had a long line and a bit of a wait. Cinnamon roll french toast was good. Salmon cream cheese spinach omelet  had  lots of good salmon. The cream cheese was a bit odd - it was in chunks. Service was good.Cafe Pino is the sort of place I am totally mixed on. I wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. But, my experience here was odd at best. 

Went with one of my friends, Meredith G., after a movie. We were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. Also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were "ok." This quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.

The pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall.The good thing about this place is everything but the steaks and waiter. The salad, bread, and dessert, and side dishes were superb. The steak tasted like a $15 steak. I guess it's the way they cook it-- which was meeh for me. Once I got my steak, my mouth dropped. The outside of the steak was BLACK. It was burnt! I was so disappointed. I told the waiter and instead of apologizing, he was defending himself and saying how that's the way the steak is supposed to be. WHAT AN ASS. I'm paying a lot for my steak and I should at least have an opportunity to enjoy it! The worst waiter ever. Although everything but the steak was good, I give it 2 stars due to the fact that this steakhouse can't even perfect a steak (well, it is a steakhouse after all!) and the waiter was a douche bag.SERVICE
Stumbled upon this place while shopping in Tempe Marketplace.  We went to dinner around 5 on a Saturday so it was not crowded at all.  That being said, to echo others, the service was pretty bad when there was really no reason for it to be so.  Ordered a salad and was not asked what dressing I wanted so I assumed it was already dressed.  Salad was served with no dressing and could not flag down a server to get dressing for about 10 minutes.  I sat there and made my companions all feel to awkward to eat because I couldn't eat the salad without dressing (literally, dry as a bone).   It was generally hard to get our server to our table and when we managed, he seemed irritated.  

MENU
Largely overpriced.  It's bar food with a little extra but at dinner prices.  My companion had the Sliders which were unremarkable but the beef was of relatively good quality.  
I ordered the Chop Shop cobb which was again, overpriced (aprox $12 for something a bit larger than a dinner salad) which was fresh and had some good produce (although my avocado was not ripe) but again, not dressed and sort of boring in the end.  
Diversity was lacking- a small selection of pretty generic offerings.  

CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY
This is going to gross some people out but I was given a straw without a wrapper on it and when I put it in my mouth, it was salty... as though someone had stuck a sweaty/dirty hand into a bin of straws.  My dinner companion had the exact same experience.  We were both really unnerved and grossed out.  

ATMOSPHERE
It's brand new so the facilities are generally clean and well kept but the atmosphere is ridiculous.  It's sort of Texas Roadhouse meets Coyote Ugly and neither work very well.  There's just something awkward about trying to eat dinner with a mechanical bull beside you.I didn't really expect to eat good Mexican Food in a sketchy hotel off the strip in Vegas. My assumptions were not wrong.  The food was average.  Nothing to celebrate or recommend but a decent meal in a hotel where the other option is a buffet or Jonny Rockets to go.

The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.  We were constantly asking for my water, chips and for them to take our order.  I don't enjoy restuarants where I have to do more work to get them to do their job. 

Granted, this place was a nice escape from the outside environment of a gross off the strip hotel. But please, don't expect muchI want to preface this review by stating that I have over 25 years experience in retail management and customer service so I understand fully the rigors of large big box store and interfacing with customers on a daily basis. 

I was pretty appalled at my recent shopping experience there and because of what occurred I won't shop there again. Prior to this I liked this store a lot and shopped there often. Its clean and well organized. Generally the staff is helpful and not pushy and they have great discounts on plants in the garden department. 

I went in to buy 4 eye screws for a shelf I had at home. My sale totaled a little over 5 bucks for the 4 screws. I paid for them inside the store and specifically asked the cashier to put the receipt in the bag where it would be visible as I next was going to the garden department to check out some plants on my way out. it was a small bag and the receipt was hanging out of it not to mention the bags they use at Lowe's are translucent and you can see through them fairly well. 

I picked out 3 plants in the garden department and went to the counter to pay. I placed the bag of the screws on the counter as I went to get cash out of my purse. The receipt was hanging out on the top of the bag and you could also see it through the side of the bag. I was really taken aback when the cashier asked to see my receipt for the stuff in the bag. I cancelled my purchase and went to the front to ask for a manager. 

He explained that it was store policy for the cashiers in the garden department to ask for receipts for items not purchased in the garden department. I've made 25 or more purchases the same way... first in the store then out to the garden department to get some plants.. and NOT ONCE has anyone EVER asked to see my receipts. My own experience in managing a big box store that's owned by the same company as Lowe's tells me that this is NOT their policy and the policy is to ask for a receipt for a large un-bagged item that is hand carried by the customer such as a garden hose or a carpet or lumber etc. The fact that the bag was on the counter with the receipt hanging out of it and clearly visible should have been more than enough for this cashier. I can only venture to guess that she had a desire to exert petty authority and this is how she did it. I've seen this before and had the unhappy experience of managing the same type of employees and had to counsel and re train them.  Nobody wants their shopping experience to include a shake down and I certainly felt it was way out of line. 

I got a call from one of the store managers the following day after complaining to the corporate office and I felt his response was lack luster. While he valued my input as a consumer he sure didn't do anything to win me back as a customer. If this had come across my desk as a manager I would have asked that customer to come into the store and offer them a $10 gift card to show how much I wanted them back. I'm not looking for handouts but I spend money at Lowe's every month. In protecting those 5 dollars worth of eye screws they lost hundreds in future sales. A 10 buck gift card could have won that back. its simple math. 

I'm back to shopping at Home Depot now and that is where I'll stay. The prices are lower overall and they seem to value the customer a great deal more.This place was a real let down.

 I was really looking forward to trying Stacy's and am completely disappointed. I ordered the rib tips and string beans and my boyfriend ordered the hotlinks, coleslaw, and sweet tea. We shared an order of fried pickles. The sweet tea was old and had that weird old sweet tea aftertaste. We didn't let it phase us and were still looking forward to the meal. The fried pickles came out with no sauce, we asked for and were given 2 ramekins of ranch. The waitress came back to the table and told us the charge was 50 cents. My teeth are still aching from the rib tips- they were practically inedible. Instead of the juicy hotlinks that I'd imagined, we got burnt, dry links that were absolutely SWIMMING in sauce. And they didn't give us any bread! I did enjoy my string beans and my boyfriend's coleslaw was tasty as well. 

First and last time at Stacy's.The Fall From Sushi Grace!! 
Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now.Food is usually good. It is loud, get a booth if you can so you can hear the person you are with. Don't depend on much service and you will be happy. It is a bar like atmosphere, lots of TVs, the games are on, people are yelling, kids are yelling, don't plan on going there to chill out and all is good. Tried this place for a second time on Saturday again got a table next to a screaming kid. When they cleared the table the they flung food at us.  I am not sure if they just employ young people that just don't care or if the noise is so loud it makes them all crazy. I was so stressed out from the noise I put on my headset and listened to music....Never again!!Well I hate to disagree with the reviews on here about this place but I thought the food was sub par. I am not sure if I went on an off night but I was not impressed at all. I had monkey balls and ninja jalapenos to start and they were terribly breaded and flavorless. Next came locally named rolls that were all covered in eel sauce and were not made with quality ingredients.Nice place, nice decor, roomy/huge (empty) patio (with no service on a Friday night - we had to schlep our own drinks!!!) but...

Big large room - rather cavernous...with a small band playing in the main room, diners chatting, etc. it was way too hard to have a decent dinner conversation.

Wait and bar staff were friendly.  Host was kind of a cold fish.

We waited about 25 minutes on a Friday night and the place was certainly not jammed.

Food was average at best - small portions for the money.  No one in our party of 6 raved about any of their dishes.  Salsa containers (for hot salsa) are so ridiculously small you can barely get a chip in there to dip!!!  What's up with that?  The salsa was not that good either.

Good margs - especially the sangria marg but that's about it.

Nice place too bad the food does not live up the decor/vibe.  I get the feeling they could be killing a good concept unless they improve the food.

I may try again for lunch to see if it improves over time...but only if I'm in the area.  They did have nice clean restrooms which is always one of my barometers for how they operate...nothing worse than a dirty/disgusting restroom in a restaurant.Two stars for being the worst of the three that I've been to.

The usual SS staples are there, and the food isn't bad, but they ditched the Calimari that is on the Chicago menu!  Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!

Mostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.

Just misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else.Was in vegas for the super bowl and made reservation at Sushi Samba Saturday night.  The menu looked interesting and I love sushi.  The decor is pretty cool, and as other people have posted it is loud, but that didn't bother me.  Our waitress was asian and very hard to understand.  Is it too much to ask that I understand our server?  We asked for help on the menu, but she was useless.  We ordered some sushi and grilled beef.  The sushi was totally average which was a major disappointment.  They messed up our order and brought us grilled chicken.  Took forever to get our beef.  The drinks were good, but again took forever.  It wasn't even that busy.  Couldn't wait to get out of there....I don't understand all the hoopla about this place.  The last time I ate here was probably 2005.  The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular.  The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great, fresh and non-microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger.

To each there own I guess :-)We have been a few times. Usually they were fun. Our most recent time I spent 50 minutes in line waiting to place our order then 20 minutes for our food. Once we ate our toddler was ready to go,  I spent all my time in line and waiting, it was a disappointing family outing. Perhaps they can figure out a way to expedite the service.This store is on my way to work and it is the only one so I am forced to stop here to get my favorite coffee. Their employees are very rude. I am moving on Saturday and I cannot wait to not have to come back to this location. 
My experience today was the last straw. 
No one was in line to order in the drive thru so I went right up to the menu and waited a good minute before anyone said anything. I order, and a man repeats the order back to me completely wrong. So I go to correct him and a girl cuts him off over the speaker "yeah. okay. we got It. pull forward"

Okay....rude. 

I get to the window and a man rang me up. In the process of doing this a girl comes up to him and asked him "since you're doing that, can I clock out now"
I've never had a good experience here as far as the customer service. I go there everyday and not one person has ever asked me my name. 
I worked at Starbucks before and that's why I'm being so critical. 

Today was my last day going to this location.

The stars are for the coffee. It's great!We ordered two sandwiches - one large, one regular and we could not tell a difference in size when they arrived at our table.  If I wanted cooked with with BBQ sauce thrown on top, I would have ate at home.  Whatever happened to cooking the meat IN THE SAUCE??  The smoked flavor of the meat was so overwhelming, I could not taste the sauce.Miserable spot in a depressing corner of the airport. It's overcrowded, dirty and dated. Service was slow but it wasn't their fault. When I flagged her down, my waitress, though obviously harried and overworked, was surprisingly pleasant, earning FSG an extra star. 

It was a slow night in the world of sports, and a terrified-looking family in a corner had to ask the staff to change the channel away from a grizzly UFC-type thing set in the jungle. The manager couldn't work the remote and succeeded only in alienating the segment of the restaurant half-watching a listless game of third-tier baseball. 

A drunk followed up by dropping a glass on the floor, which made an already grim atmosphere feel somehow worse. The whole thing felt like a bad carnival experience.  

I left feeling unsatisfied and vaguely anxious, exactly the opposite of what you want before boarding a plane.What sounded like a promising and even delicious burger, the Buffalo Ranch, arrived at my table as a total disappointment. To start with, the "seasoned" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were "seasoned" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).  At least the server Brandon was a nice guy and he offered to remove the burger from my check. For this, and the fact that the place serves beer and has sports on tv, Fox gets two stars.First off the bat there.  the lady that took our order was not really paying attention to our orders.  Hence is why im eating burgers with my friend right now that we did not order and got it wrong.  My friend ordered a modernest.  But she got a way different burger with jalapenos in it.  Way to spicy for her and for her one year old daughter.  
I ordered the midevil burger with the biggest size of patty.  Yet i got a burger the size of a mcdonalds happy meal burger.   The fries where limp and soggy.  The only positive part of this meal was the sweet potato fries.
Also word of advice for the workers there, pay attention to your customers orders and pull up your pants. If i wanted to go see some thong and ass id go to a strip club.I came here for a scale. They had none in stock.

The store itself was relatively tidy, though a bit strangely organized.

Took me a while to find someone to help me, and then took them even longer to tell me they had nothing in stock, even though I started off the conversation with "there are none on the shelf".

The employees were friendly enough, but the overall experience was meh, even for a Best Buy.This is average food with a hip atmosphere.my gf and i are avid bww patrons, i'd say every weekend we partake, however lately we've been experiencing a lot of problems with their pick-up / carry-out service which we often place orders through.

fairly recently we've been having issues with them getting the order right.  typically they forget utensils, missing orders of celery and / or ranch, give us the wrong flavor, etc - but the line was drawn for us when we placed a 24pc wing order only to see that there were 12 wings in a 24pc box and the other half of the order was not included after coming home, relaxing in front of the tv and getting ready to eat.

never had we really experienced a problem with dining in (with the exception of the occasional lag of service when it's a little crowded) but all of these mistakes with carry-out has started to rub us the wrong way.

when picking up an order, always always ALWAYS double-check right in front of them.I will give this place two stars because the service was pretty good. The food was another story. 
Our waiter was very attentive and offered some great suggestions to start. One of which was the "drunken chicken nachos". We ordered a couple of them for our group and when it was brought over, one of the first comments was - " wtf is that smell?"
I really am not sure what was added to those nachos, but it looked like a pile of crap. It didnt taste any better. So for entrees I think the majority of us either ordered the short ribs or the filet mignon. I guess since this was a Mexican place I should've ordered something else, so maybe this was my fault. But the waiter who took our order described the steak to be comparable to some NYC quaility steakhouse cuts. Steak looked nice and plated well but it was lacking some seasoning. Overall I would not recommend this place or ever go again. Afterwards I began to understand the name YOLO, I felt pretty sick and thought I was going to die. You definitely only live once after eating here.Sat at the bar. The bartender sucked, lame attitude, no silverware, never asked about food or needing another beer and basically not very friendly.
The chips & salsa were pretty good, not great. The chicken fajitas were ok but typical, nothing to brag about. They need to make the beer colder and the staff warmer.My experience was seemingly better than most of the reviews I've read on here. That being said I still have to give it a 2 star experience as far as the service was concerned. I booked my car a week in advance: 3 days for a grand total of $51
Not bad considering other companies were close to twice that. The taxes here are insane.

When I arrived there was nobody in line, so I was served immediately. I gave the lady my name and ID, she found my reservation and that's where the fun began.
It went more or less like this:


"Sir, are you going out of state with this car?" 

"Uh, no, wasn't planning on it"

"Oh, because if you were you can get a Sonata Hybrid for $12 per day more!"

"Not bad, but no, I won't need it."

"Are you sure? It's a nice car!"

"No, that's OK, thanks."

"Ok, no problem. Will you be adding insurance for only $26 dollars a day?"

"No, I've got my own"

"Are you sure? This is Las Vegas! We have the highest insurance rates in the country because of the accidents and theft!"

"No, I'm from Miami, I'm familiar with the problem"

"I don't think it's a good idea, I had a renter just last week had their car stolen out of the Valet lot at the Mirage, and people break into the cars all the time! You'd be stupid not to take the insurance because your insurance won't cover the cost of downtime and other expenses!"

"Wow. Sounds like that's the Valet's problem really. No thank you. I'll be fine"

"You're getting an unheard of rate of $8 a day, you mean to tell me you won't protect yourself for only $78 dollars more?!"

"Yes, I'm sure."

"Ok then, the total will be $66"

"I was told it was $51 when I booked online. Taxes and fees included... why is it more??"

"We automatically add roadside assistance for $15 when you book. If you have any problems the hookup to the tow truck alone will cost you $75!"

I was tired of fighting.. "Whatever, fine."

The next day I called in and complained, they took off the extra $15 because I KNEW I wasn't going to need it. Most of my driving consisted of driving from one parking lot to the other and the occasional trip off strip.

My entire trip I was paranoid that something horrible was going to happen, like I'd come back to find my wheels were missing or I'd find my car days later in the bottom of the Grand Canyon stripped clean by the buzzards.

Yes, a very 2 star experience.Populated by a surly staff who, due to the neighborhood, start from the assumption that everyone in the store is a criminal, it at least has a larger selection than the one on Trop @ Pecos.I have a friend who I may not trust with my life, but I do trust with dining and nightlife recommendations. Basically, wherever he tells me to go, I go.

This was the first time my trust in him was shaken. 

My companion got meatloaf that was terrible; my steak was tough and flavorless. Our bread basket was good, though. 

Service was friendly but inept.

The place was empty.

The herb garden in the back room is beautiful. Actually, the whole restaurant is beautiful, especially with the pool area lit all beautifully.

The giant cotton candy ball was the highlight of the evening. What does it mean when $.10 of sugar ends up being the best part of your dining experience?

Oh well, you win some, you lose some.I was not impressed by Bradbury's. The atmosphere was cool, but the seating situation was not ideal. Considering how long it took me to get my meal (which was just tea and a crepe), the lack of chairs without back support was kind of a bummer. I agree with earlier reviewers that the staff was pretty stand-offish; they seemed awfully tense for people who get to make crepes for a living. As far as the crepes themselves go: they were crepes. Standard, middle-of-the-line crepes. I ordered a sweet rhubarb crepe and tried some of my friend's trout crepe, and both of them were pretty average. They were good, but hardly worth the prices that were charged for them. 

Bradbury's: All I'm saying is you can get comparable crepes elsewhere without the uncomfortable seats and snobby staff.Just got back from eating at Kabuki, which I was treated to by a friend.

I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer; I love soft shell crab.  Their soft shell crab tasted like the smell of a wet dog, and I had to force myself to finish it.

I ordered the dragon roll sushi, and it was a tasteless mush.  Oh, it looked cute, done in a little dragon form, but I can't ever remember being that underwhelmed by unagi before.

I ordered the apple tart dessert, and again, it was a tasteless mush.  I could barely tell what I was eating.

I was dining with others, and I tried some of their baked salmon and salmon sushi, and it was all just blah.  I can't ever recall eating sushi and Japanese cuisine that bland before.I love Indian Food. 

I'm constantly driving through this intersection and have always wanted to try it.  I finally got the chance and on top of that it was lunchtime and their sign said, "LUNCH SPECIALS".  

I arrived around 11 am and the place is empty.  I ordered the "dinner" portion as I was sharing with my child.  $13 for Chicken Curry & Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also ordered a side of plain Naan.  

The entree came with a "row" of rice that separated the two choices I made.  The rice tasted like something that came from Uncle Bens--no flavor and every time I scooped up rice there was a lot of water-soaked rice underneath.  The chicken curry and chicken masala tasted the same, one was red the other wasn't.  Again, very little flavor.  

How can Indian food lack so much flavor???  The naan was just a flat bread, nothing important about it... but it vaguely reminded me of the frozen Naan they sell at Trader Joe's... and when I started thinking about it, so did the Curry & Masala.  I ended up spending over $20 dollars for my meal that I shared with my young child.  I felt like I could have gotten the same thing at Trader Joe's sans the watery rice for about $10. 

I gave this place two stars... just based on the great service the waitress gave and another for it trying to be a healthy Indian restaurant.  Trust... go to the Indian Buffet in the airpark, although it's the real deal, it's worth the money and calories!Dirty, crowded, loud, unwelcoming. That about sums up what I think of this 99 Ranch Market. I definitely agree with Tony T. that the 99 Ranch Markets in Southern California offer a completely different shopping experience. This location has very poor customer service. It seems like they have a lot of employees, but not a single one ever talks to me or tries to help out at all. On a couple different occasions, I've had to carry down a large bag of rice by myself because no one would help me. On top of that, the prices aren't the cheapest, but I think many people don't know about other Asian groceries in town, so they just rely on this one. The place isn't necessarily a mess, but it's definitely dirty and I never see anyone cleaning the floors or anything. I'd like to say I'll never come here again, but I know I probably will.the broth was too sweet for me. perhaps just personal taste though.We were a party of 10, on 3 different tables. Our table was a disaster. My 'American Kobe Beef''' burger, was cooked medium well, when I asked for medium. My wifes was medium when it was supposed to be medium. I could not taste any Kobe distinguished flavour in my burger, to be sure. 
Another one of our tables waited well past after were were finished before they were served, and again, their burgers were all cooked incorrectly. Table 3 of ours enjoyed their burgers alot and they got served in decent time.
The place has great ambience, the shakes are to die for, but the manager has to get ahold of his kitchen/grill staff and kick some ass. Cause they are sorta out of control at least as of July 29, 2008.I could give you a rundown of this whole menu item by item and tell you where to get a better version of it somewhere else in Vegas AND at a better price.  LBS at Red Rock blows this place away in every way possible.  $5 for fries??  Give me a break.We have given this place several try's. I have really wanted to like it, it's 
close to my house and took over a cute old diner. The service here is just 
bad and saying that about a pho spot is kind of redundant. However that only fly's when you are in Chinatown. We actually waited 20 min for our food after we ordered?!? For a bowl of Pho?? Usually it's on the table 30 seconds after you order it. There may have been six pieces of meat in my small bowl. Which besides the ammount of broth was the same as the large bowl. Then they come around to vacuume by our table at 9:00? They close at 10 and are telling people at 9:45 they will have to get the food to go(they went somewhere else....go figure). As far as the food it's just OK. I have eaten in Pho places all over and some are a little better than others but they are all pretty much the same. Just give me a large portion with pleanty of vegg on the side and I'll be happy. Pho 8 opening across the street is gonna put a serious crimp in thier numbers. Or maybe it already has they were basicly empty when we were there?!?The service was good and the decor is fun, but I'm not sure that makes up for where The Mad Greek falls short. 

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. 

The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. 

I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. 

When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.

Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch.Overpriced, overrated. Their pad Thai is different alright--chow mein noodles?Everybody knows what Swiss Chalet is like so I won't bother talking about the food, Its consistently above average.  However, recently I tried to order online and had a terrible experience.  

At first i called and had to sit through 5 minutes of pre-recorded message before i was worthy of speaking with a human.  At which point I had a flier with a "2 can Dine for 14.99" coupon of which said nothing about its validity for a delivery order.  I was however denied the use of the coupon.  The gentleman on the phone was from a call center in India even though i called the Waterloo number from the flier.  After attempting to place my order I was transferred to a different gentleman. Who was presumably from the Waterloo restaurant.  He proceeded to ask the same questions i had already answered.  It was at this point i hung up and ordered from a different restaurant.This place was PACKED at lunch, so they must be doing something right.  But it's definitely not the Pad Thai.  They sat me immediately, and took my order fairly quickly, but then it was over a half hour before I got my entree.  The Pad Thai was edible, but seriously lacking in flavor.  I asked for it medium spicy, but there was no heat whatsoever.  Just a bland, almost maple-syrup flavor.  I would have asked for some hot sauce, but between delivery of the food and the bill, nobody checked on me.  Guess I can't complain too much, however, as it was relatively cheap.  (But isn't most Thai food?).I love bebe so I would've thought 2b bebe is pretty similar right? I know it's not the exact same quality since the price ranges between those two stores are night and day. 

I went in on a WEEKDAY NIGHT. Probably 2 hours prior to store closing. Customer service wasn't very good. I only had one associate greet me the entire time while I was there but I think she only asked if I needed any assistance because I was shopping at the section she was folding clothes at.

Their layout of their merchandise isn't all that shopper friendly. Most of their clothes are hung on top bars and bottom bars. I'm a short girl (5ft 1in)....good luck to the other short girls trying to reach for items at the top bars. It just doesn't make a good shopping experience while trying to browse/reach for items up top all while having a bunch of other items on my arms at the same time.

I made my way towards the fitting rooms and nobody was there to assist me. Or so I thought. A few moments later, an associate emerged from outta nowhere. Watcha doin hiding in the fitting room girl?!?! I know you had to straighten out the go-backs and such but the go-back racks are located in the front of the fitting room anyways. 

Accessories rack wasn't very appealing either. Bracelets were just thrown in baskets while earrings and necklaces were hung on racks in a messy way. Necklaces were all tangled.

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come to this store. If I'm in the area, fine...I'll stop by. But this is definitely a "meh. I've experienced better" kind of store. I was only here because all their tops were 30% off.Ewww... another label bites the dust. They have low quality cheap clothing made specially for their outlet stores... Occasionally you might find a hand me down that didn't get sold from their regular Guess store but the majority of the stuff here is a step down from their normal stuff. Not worth your time. But if it is hot enough, definitely worth your time in the store... they REALLY blast the AC.Ok good
Nothing special
Very loud. Music is not conducive to having since, quiet mealQuick shitty pizza found in malls and airports.. though big slices and decent prices.Very disappointed in the turn this buffet has taken.  I've eaten there probably 50+ times (four times in the last two weeks) and in the last few months it has just become OK as opposed to a place I'd want to eat.  

My biggest disappointment is that they have removed the beef brisket from the line up.  It was always my favorite and one of the most flavorful tender briskets I've had.  That was the main draw for me, as with many of my friends.  

Now I've been told by Silverton that they have brisket every day.  I'm not sure what they think brisket is, but what they are serving is roast beef.  I'm from the South and I know my brisket.  What they are trying to pass off as brisket is actually a cut of meat from hind quarters of the cow as opposed to a flat cut from the breast section.  Brisket can be flaked apart with a fork, as opposed to having to be cut with a knife the way the roast beef they are serving has to be.  

Also, it used to be a much wider variety of food on various days, now it is the same thing every day!  The only thing that seems to change up is the Asian section.  

I asked to talk to a manager tonight, right after we arrived.  I explained how much I loved their brisket and asked when and if if would ever be back.  She said she would talk to the Chef and let me know what she found out.  She never came back.  

I was recently traveling for 10 weeks, so I wasn't in during that time, but if I recall correctly, things started changing before I left.  I was told that they had a new chef, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with some of the changes.  It was perfect before, why change what isn't broken.

I sure hope I don't have to take Seasons Buffet off my recommended list.Trys to be high class but does not deliver 

First off the fried artichoke hearts were pointless. Flavorless, mostly uneatable husk and overpriced. The steak was average but it did not make up for the flat cole slaw. The chicken salad was good but everything seemed pricey for the quality. Most of all the location tried to be high class but it stopped short and the service and menus, table settings, ect were more like a diner. 

We do not think we will be returning.This is a much more manageable version of Forever 21, where you don't feel overwhelmed by the variety and super long lines... but the quality is pretty much on par and a little more expensive.

I like the cute gift and odd/ends items, good for misc bday stuffers.Breakfast review only.. 
It's a bad sign when the waiter warns the table the kitchen is very slow, so the buffet is a better bet if you don't want to be there for a while. 
What's worse is that I considered this warning an improvement over past experiences - waiting forever to be served, and having only minutes to slam down a meal before heading to the next meeting. 

I've had a number of business meeting breakfasts here, but ONLY because the people I meet stay at the hotel. The food is average. I cannot think of anything better to say about it. No standouts, no pitfalls - well, maybe the yogurt parfait because it is so small. I waited how long for this??? At least the waiter was gracious enough to give us warning...Where do I start?
The instructors are great, but go a bit too easy on the kids, especially with regards to earning their belts...
Otherwise, my main objection to this place is the cost. The first 6 months are $100/mo for each child (no discount for the 2nd; but the rest of the family is free after that) and every 8 weeks your child graduates (whether you think they really deserve it or not--let's face it, you can't "hold them back" if the rest of the class, including their brother, is moving on) and each graduation carries a $50 - $80 fee (for each child). Oh, and then there is the gear that is required: $40 for gloves; $40 for foot gear; $50 for a foam bat that can be made for $5 (but are not ATA approved, so you can't use them in class). All of this times 2 for my two boys.
Then, on top of that, they are strongly encouraged to switch from the "basic" $100/month class to the "weapons" training $150/month class with even more weapons and gear to buy and tournaments to enter (don't forget those belt ceremonies every 8 weeks!)

Unbelievable that anyone could truly afford this. I'd rather put that $400-$450/month into their college funds. It will do them a whole lot more good in the long run.

Until then, we'll keep hiking and biking and swimming. Total cost: $0/month.I have to agree with a number of other Yelpers who have commented that the food is rather lackluster at Two Hippies.

The restaurant itself is very cool...stepping inside to order and waiting on the side porch and or back porch for your food is for a moment like being transported to Venice Beach or Mission Beach in Cali.

But alas visions of California soon recede (and you snap back to the the fact that...damn...I am still in Phoenix) once you eat the food here. The portions for the taco's and burros are large but oh so bland.

I had to drench a vegetarian burro I ordered with green sauce to get any flavor and even then it was still a bland meal.

There are much better taco and burrito shops in downtown Phoenix  (La Condesa Taco Shop is best I have been at in Phoenix so far...have to do a review soon) so look around and don't get sucked into Two Hippies just for the scenery.I thought I had written a review from my visit in March but I guess not lol. My brother and his wife live in Arizona, so this is where we went right after I landed and our waiter was fabulous etc etc. I give it two stars for my first night experience, plus I love the company establishment etc. I would give it a one star or even none if I could for my second experience here. This rating is solely based upon my experience and not the establishment itself, because I am a fan of the Yard House. I had a horrible snobb stick up his a** waiter! He seemed like life was miserable. I mean everyone else, including the manager was amazing so I am sorry to give such a low rating, but like I said, it is solely based on my experience with this one waiter. I only wish I got his name, so I could warn everyone not to get served by him! lol. He seemed as if he was so miserable and he was taking it out on us. Let's see, i'll describe him. Black or dark brown spiky hair...caucasian, light skin, and snooty!Eh...  

Maybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.

Hubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.

The soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.

The chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  

The sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.So, this was my second time entering this establishment. The first was to buy a gift card for my daughters teacher & the bartender (the ONLY man in the place who can sell you a gift card apparently~ young guy...fohawk?) ignored my desperate glances for all of 20 minutes before he finally granted me (the sale of) 1 gift card.  So, round two, today.....was told upon arrival (12pm) that it will be 15-25 minutes for the 1st available table, wait 40 minutes before the pager buzzes only to notice she called 8 parties that arrived AFTER us. She couldn't bear to apologize for the loss of our lunch hour~ didn't care or acknowledge that we were standing 10 feet from her while she was piling other guests in front of us.  We spent 45$ (plus tip) on 2 meals that we had to leave behind, because there wasn't time to wait for our food (had to go pick up kids from school).  The waiter was nice, but I don't have a clue where they get all their customers, the pinto beans were yummy, but their fish tacos have nothing on Otro.  Never again, not for me.Grim.  Ageing and tired.  There are a few absolutely dreadful basement rooms with no view, no wifi, no 3G signal and no hope.  The other rooms are only just better, with furniture that looks as if it's about to fall to bits any second.
Also... if you're in one of the ground floor or basement rooms at the back, do make sure your windows are secured: a colleague of mine suffered a break-in here.
If you can, try to get in the "club" rooms across the road, which are generally slightly larger and nicer in my opinion (but don't get your hopes up too high).
However: one good point is that the breakfast is not bad at all.  Porridge is included, which is not the case in all hotels.
On the whole, though, avoid if you possibly can.I haven't eaten in this bar so I can't review the food, but as a bar I'm not keen on it. Whenever I go out socially with my exercise group we always end up going here for some reason and I never enjoy it. It's a weird layout for a bar, but maybe that's because of the restaurant as well which divides it up. It makes it hard to find somewhere to stand and we always seem to be in the way of people passing to the toilet which you have to go down a flight of stairs to get to. The toilets are shared with Bar Napoli. 

I personally don't think there's a great atmosphere in the bar and with all the great bars in Edinburgh to choose from I would never choose to come here.This is an GroupOn voucher experience. 
Would I have entered this bar from the street? Probably not. 
The front is small and elongated, it looks crammed from the outside and indeed it is.
The back room is spacious and there was a private party or something going on. So we were advised that meals are served in the front area. 

 We did nearly sit on others people's laps getting to our table. For pub, drinking purposes that is possibly fine and acceptable, but we were here to eat a meal. 

We booked for 19:15 and we arrived prompt on time. Our table was backed against another punter who had her coat hanging over her chair which was now part of our 'wall' where the table was parked against. 

We presented our voucher and asked which wine we wanted: 'Red' or 'White' - we choose red. When it arrived I got to Reading the wine list containing 3 red wines and this wine wasn't on that list. It was a Spanish table wine and a little cheap tasting, in my student days I may have even kept this sort of wine in a cupboard..as a backup.

The menu was especially for GroupOn - 2 courses + wine menu - it was a mixture of their existing full menu.

A choice of 3 starters, main & desserts. We both opted for an Steak & Haggis Pie (supplement £1.50) with new potatoes and a cranachan for afters. 

We waited for our main to arrive a long while. Just after 8pm (after being sat at our table for 45 min) it finally arrived. Now we were hoping that the long cooking time was to improve our meal or even the pastry crust - I was making plausible explanations, but none was supplied by the staff. 
I did ask for salt & pepper - I needn't bothered. The gravy was a little too salty for my taste - and I add salt to nearly everything. Anita couldn't eat it. 
Positive note: the pastry crust was perfect. 

It took a while before they cleaned the table - and they did not ask if the main was to our satisfaction. 
The cranachan was good - well better than the main, nice & sweet and we finished that. 
After that we went to pay and even though the bar staff didn't ask if we liked it, Anita A. mentioned our dissatisfaction, they were not too apologetic, but waved the supplement from our bill. 

My experience here for a meal was an uncomfortable one and not to be repeated. The bar has a nice feel when you just there for a drink with a few friends, but for a meal this is not a nice experience. 

Not one to go back to in a hurry.We had a very disappointing visit to the Mussel Inn. The soup that I had to start was extremely poor. The mussels were better, but it made us "kind of sad that I can no longer keep it in my mind as the holy grail of mussel places." 

Overall, we said: "It's an extremely popular place, as was evidenced by the lively and diverse crowd packed in for a busy lunchtime service, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the quality, particularly of the soup."I've been here a few times, each time forgetting the slow service and rather bland Thai cuisine on offer here at not particularly impressive prices. Conveniently located close to Haymarket Station, but I'd wander further afield if you want some above average Thai cuisine at the same price level.In the day, before I had any incline of indie coffee chains(pre Yelp) and when my favourite place to chill out after work was Waterstones, the coffee supplied by its previous occupiers, was more than just well coffee...I mostly went there for the banter, from the baristas.

So tell me Edinburgh what's happened to this bookywooky shop? Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not! Somehow it has left me less warm to the chain since the renovation, just like a random wifi connection.

Yep the black/cream walls could do with a good lick of paint, the toilets could be more welcoming, the dwindling book stock could be more...stocky! New coffee team, different position of the coffee shop(why change it if it ain't broken) this place is in real danger of of going either one of two ways. Either turning into an abode that resembles Black Books or a massive Kindle shop? I know which one  I'd prefer?

God help me if one day I go in and Bernard Manny and Fran are sitting drinking red wine in the corner, swatting strange unseen creatures, while they discuss the reasons not to throw a kindle in the bin, or end the suffering of book lovers and give this place back the dignity and charm it deserves or put it out to pastures new.

I did like coming here, but now as I know it's lost a few regular customers, dropped a few more books since I started writing this email and not really made many inspirational changes to keep me from going elsewhere then apologies to them.

But if your gonna subtract something then if you add something else you really should multiply to get better results. With great power comes greater responsibility so please Waterstones be even greater and more responsible!Not being a regular shopper at this store I am generally shocked and disappointed when I come in to buy occasional last minute birthday/Christmas presents. Everything seems to be incredibly expensive; I do usually buy things online and i know they can't compete with those prices, but still, over £10 for a DVD seems incredibly steep to me. I find the selection of stock on display generally uninspiring and I can never be bothered trawling through the alphabetised CDs and films: if I knew what I wanted to buy, I'd get it on the internet for half the price. All in all, not a great place to shop.Ahhh... sooo much opportunity... the only Indian food in Henderson area!  They could make a killing!  We've waited so long!  So disappointed!

I stopped by earlier in the day to review the menu since I was in the area, and happily found they had pani poori and chaat and other non-standard fare - pretty much the only nice, sit-down restaurant in all of Las Vegas that serves Pani Poori AFAIK.. but I digress.  

Well I convinced my SO to go down there and give them a shot.  We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! 

Ahh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  

Tough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.

The full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  

I wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.  She wont even take this stuff to work.  She'd rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal.  *sigh*.  Such high hopes!

Sorry Taza.  Please, learn how to cook the chicken?  Is that too much to ask?I'd heard some positive buzz, but was rather unimpressed. We hit Hanny's on a Friday night and it struck me as one of those places that try to do too much and end up not doing much very well. My salad was okay but nothing I'd make a special trip for, my friend who ordered the Shrimp Pancetta appetizer said it was yummy, but the third in our party had the Pork Calabrese sandwich and it was so greasy I my skin almost broke out just sitting next to it. The too-loud (and "too cool") DJ and overpriced drinks didn't help the situation. It is a cool space and perhaps I just wanted too much, but I was simply disappointed.

I would give it another try, but only if other people were going and it was an "I'll meet up with you there" kind of thing. It definitely wouldn't be my pick. I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there. Maybe they will win me over then.Okay been here a couple more times and think I need to update. Of all the places to go this is now maybe my fourth choice. If you are meeting someone, go early to get parking otherwise you'll be later than you expect. The menu has changed and it doesn't rank as high as before - just okay, breakfast is poor and lunch depends on the day. The staff on the floor are hard working and keep it clean, the staff behind the counter is mixed. Some are cordial and others act as if waiting on you is a bother. It might be a networking place to be seen, and it seems to host cliques as if holding court...but it has lost the luster for me.Took 45 minutes to get our food. The kids ordered Mac and Cheese, wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll. Why the delay? No explanation, just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately we won't be back. Service here in the past has been brutal... Too bad.I really want to like this place.  I do.  The decor has got the hip modern "restaurant in a house" thing like The Main Ingredient, only it's more open and had no trouble accommodating our group of eleven (we had made a reservation.)  They have cucumber water, which is awesome and for the most part, everyone's dishes looked good from where I sat.
My disappointment came when it was my turn to order.  I was informed that they "don't really modify dishes because they are going for a specific style and flavor."  I worked in restaurants for 15 years.  Trust me, I get it.  You don't want me to modify the heck out of something then say I don't like it.  But unfortunately, I have some medical issues that make it difficult for me to digest more than trivial amounts of fats.  I was informed by our server, South, that I couldn't even get the dressing on the side for a salad.  They don't even have a regular grilled chicken breast.  I asked for his recommendations and the only thing that sounded remotely healthy was the vegetarian gnocchi (the regular has sausage) and I asked for it with very, very little oil in the pan.  
So, our food arrived and everything looked great.  My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese and said it was good.  Then the gnocchi arrived.  With a puddle of oil in the bottom.  Then my friend's dish arrived to my left.  Lo and behold, there were grilled vegetables on the plate (with what looked like oil on them, but even that would have been better.)  Why not just offer a side of grilled vegetables?  How hard is it to do things a la carte? 
Not being one to complain or send things back, I ate what I could of the gnocchi, pulling pieces off of the main dish and putting them on one of their share plates so I could pat the oil off of them before eating them.  About a half an hour later, I began to feel ill.
I know I could have been a jerk, made a big stink, asked for the manager, etc but why ruin everyone else's good time?  I've been a restaurant manager, I hated getting yelled at because one of my servers was pretentious and entitled and was too lazy to see what the kitchen could do.  
So, if you don't have any special dietary needs and you like to be treated like you don't know what you're talking about, go to Tuck Shop.  Otherwise, I'll stick with The Main Ingredient and ask for a slice of cucumber in my water.  At least they put dressing on the side.If you are visitor to Vegas, without the car, this is not a good place to go. It's too far, Your meal is cost as much as the same your cab. it's really hard to get a cab to pickup after you want to return.  When we were there at that time, the waiter will go around us with the meat selection we really waiting for. We end up only taste about 7-8 kinds.  I had almost everything at other brasil steakhouse.I had been tossing it around in my mind whether or not I wanted to review this place.  So, I'm just going to do it.

I had the take-out beef ribs, collard greens, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and the hush puppies.  I am really picky about ribs, and you could tell that these were not slow-cooked.  They were sort of tough, and not at all how I like them.  I didn't care for the sauce much either.  The sweet potatoes were good, and so were the greens.  Someone stole the black eyed peas from me, so I didn't taste them.  The hush puppies were fabulous though.

I dunno.  I really like ribs, but I would never have them from here again.  I don't know if it's worth it to me to go back and try something else.Blanco is not the place to find authentic Mexican food.  The atmosphere is really unique--super trendy and quite dim inside after sundown. The margarita was ok and the food was good, but nothing to write home about. They fill you up on chips and generic salsa to compensate for the smaller portions. 

I ordered the vegetable tacos with grilled chicken and black beans. The accompanying carrots and risotto-like rice were very out of place. 

The service was impersonal and we hardly received any attention from our server--not even a single refill on water!  I'll go elsewhere next time I'm craving Mexican fare.The places looks good, there's a line out the door, but they are cheap on bacon for the BLT sandwich. It had two pieces total for the entire sandwich. When I ordered extra bacon it cost $3.54, for three pieces of bacon. Not happy that a BLT now cost me $13.53. To the manager, please Don't be cheap with the bacon, it makes your nice restaurant low end. 

On the positive side I had the burger and it was very tasty. My wife did like her BLT, but  won't order it again. I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the bacon.pricey for a breakfast spot, and food was not spectacular.OK, we stayed a week here. It was OK, and I agree with the other reviewers, but, we didn't have bugs like some of the other guests. I agree also, that the place needs updating, but, overall, the location and price can't be beat in that upscale area. The other hotels cost twice as much!
We plan on returning next year, and we'll brace ourselves for a new adventure. I also sent a message to the hotel management, asking if they've read their online reviews, and why don't they get a loan to update, and hire more help. We'll see what they say!!As a Louisiana native, I was not impressed.This place is now US Egg's.  Food wasn't bad, just not a lot of flavor and im a guy that likes a lot of spice.  Service was adequate as well.food was okay. prices were crazy high though.For our final evening in Vegas, my friend and I were interested in trying something low-key and decently affordable.  We had been walking the Strip all day and were finishing up at the Wynn, so a convenient stopoff seemed like the best option before heading back early to our hotel room.  Both my friend and I tend to favor Asian-style cuisine, so the beautiful Wazuzu seemed perfect.

The restaurant was only about one-third full when walked in around 7 pm on a Sunday evening.  The decor was quite shocking with the brightly painted red walls and massive glass dragon hanging along the back wall.  The environment seemed to be more of a Chinese influence than Japanese.  We were immediately seated and debated over trying the sushi or the hot meals.  When it comes to modernized Japanese places, I find that it is always a struggle to know which type of food they are known for (if any). 

My friend ordered some sushi rolls, which she enjoyed well enough.  However, my Salmon Terriyaki Bowl was terrible.  The large bowl was almost three-fourths full of brown rice.  A very small helping of  sauteed peppers and onions was thrown in as well.  The salmon was dry, fishy, and bland.  It tasted like something you would get at a low-budget diner.  The sauce was flavorful, and obviously I had more than enough rice to soak it up with.  However, the fish was a disappointment and more vegetables would have been appreciated.

Wazuzu was a marginal experience, but not a place I would return to.  If you are looking for something similar, I would recommend Sushi Roku in Caesar's WAY before this place.My first visit to Sinatra earlier this year was great and merited 4 stars. Unfortunately, my last visit was not as good.

The food was actually the same: great but not the best I've ever had. 

What changed was the service. On my last visit it was reasonably attentive, despite the fact that I was dining in a large group. When I returned, everything seemed fine until we placed our order. The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.

That meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.

Yep - even after we complained about being totally and completely ignored, the waiter never returned to apologize or explain. 

Guess it's Spago for my next Vegas outing instead.Nothing against this applebees particularly. The company as a whole has gone to hell. They've gotten rid of all their good beers, appetizers and entres. The boneless wings kept going up in price, the beer went up with less selection, thai chicken pizza GONE, jalapeno poppers GONE, onion peels GONE. It's like the people running the company are completely backwards. As a result I have not been back in over a year. Other places have more beer, better prices, and better food. No reason to go back to applebees.Usually I love Paradise Café. However, I have given this one four or five different tries. Unfortunately this one does not make the cut is not make the cut.  I don't know how you can mess up the salad but they manage to do it each and every time.  Ordered one half of a sandwich and after one by the bread was crumbling apart.  I specifically asked to make sure the bread was fresh because I've had this problem time and time again.  I guess they can't tell the difference between stale dry and fresh bread.  

And last but not least is the Joker that works the cash register.  If he would just do his job and quit trying to entertain it might be a nice experience.

Won't be coming back here, maybe another paradise café but not this oneThe decor of Beijing Noodle No. 9 is awesome but like most Vegas' places that's all there is to it for what they charge... eh-hem overpriced meals. I came here for a work lunch as everywhere else had a 30 minute wait. Ordered an ice tea, not bad, and then the beef chow fun. The beef chow fun was not bad, kind of greasy and the beef was overcooked. Noodles are made fresh in house so thumbs up. Service left little to be desired and even though I did not pay for the meal I wouldn't come back.Came for a quick lunch. It was not busy but the hostess was not at her post. I had to wait around, wondering where she was. Finally she came to get me and seated me next to a very rowdy Chinese family. 

I received a glass of water and I placed my order. I ordered the chicken and seasonal vegetables. She brought me over a fork and set it down without a word. I tend to get a little irritated at that, because I'm a white person, I'm an ignorant who can't use chopsticks? 

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks. On top of that, I never actually got a plate. I just ate off the serving dish because no one bothered to give me one or check on me.Stay here yearly over Spring Break. They always suggest calling in with special requests (location, floor, etc). The problem is that they don't accommodate those requests. WE got in late because of airplane problems and the person in front of us in the registration line was complaining about calling in several times on his request and having them ignored. We followed. We had indicated a preferred building with close parking due to my inability to walk long distances comfortably. Instead they put us in a building with no handicapped parking in front of it and in the farthest room from the parking lot. And of course at the time we arrived there were no other rooms available to switch too. For the money we spent to buy the time shares you would think they'd try a bit harder to make their customers happy. But apparently they don't care.I have eaten lunch here (sandwich, chips, obligatory pickle), but I am specifically Yelping about the bakery.  I purchased a "Holly Go-Lightly" cake for my Mother to celebrate Mother's Day, and was really disappointed.  The price is steep (over $30 for an 8 inch cake...maybe it was even a 6 inch cake...) but I have always been willing to pay for those extra special touches.  But there was nothing special about this cake.  I admit, I was taken in by the glittered frosting, however, the frosting was not as good as most buttercream frosting on your average wedding cake.  And the [yellow] cake itself was dry.  My Mother said that maybe we did not serve it appropriately (meaning, that cake is ideally served at room temperature as opposed to directly from the refrigerator) but come on, we know good cake when we taste it, cold or warm.  So, after the "ooh" and "ahh" I received upon opening the box, that was the last of the compliments.I love Anthropologie but this store sucks. I travel a lot and I always check out the local Anthro store. Love their products and unique stores. This one has the worst display on the planet. The saleswomen are friendly if you're well dressed. Otherwise they follow you around if you have merchandise in your hand like you're going to steal. Seriously guys get cameras or get a life! Not sure if its racist or judgmental but I couldn't help noticing how unfriendly it was for people who weren't impeccably dressed white people.  Anthros from other cities, I love you. Great sense of style, design and display. The quality of products is not great all the time but 60% of my home is Anthro :)  I pick and choose the best they have to offer.Tubing for a drip system in my garden is not in gardening; it's in plumbing.  I guess that makes sense as I'm putting a plumbing system in my garden, or at least my wife is.  Light bulbs are not in lighting; they are in a separate light bulb section.  Not sure how to rationalize that one, but changing light bulbs is all me, in case you were wondering.  And so it goes in the aisles of Lowes that feel more like a maze with dead ends, trick turns, and no end in sight.  I would end up blaming myself if customer service weren't lacking.  It seems to be hit or miss with few hits.  The best thing Lowes has going is a convenient location.We used to eat here once a week because it was that good. The last take out a couple days ago was so disappointing, and we ordered our usual favorites: Panang Curry and Pad Woon Sen with Shrimp. Panang's taste had changed and the Pad Sen had a chewy piece of meat in it  (i ordered shrimp) and some sharp small bone-like things that almost made me puke when I spit them out. 

I used to think this place was 5 star also, but you only get 2 when you mess with people's food. *sigh* I'll give it a shot one more time, but the once a week visits are over. It'll be a few months before you see me again.

So long Sakun ThaiOn a positive note The rooms are spacious and quiet. Diamond Members please note: in room coffee is the worse, not even drinkable!
no business center, computers are .25 per minute!  A small cafe with limited offerings and Starbucks opens at 7:00AM. Huge construction project going on. Not set up for a business traveler.Et tu, Aria?

Seems like this hotel has joined the long list of other resorts that have thrown away customer service, simple common sense AND appreciation for their paying customers customers. I was there for EDC Weekend (June 8-11) and, I have to agree with my fellow yelpers there, that the check-in fiasco has left a bitter taste even a week after the trip. The first thing you expect to do when arriving at your vacation destination is check-in, drop off your luggage, and relax! All of this could not be done because our arrival was met with a 2.5 hour long line of disgruntled travelers standing static and clueless to a computer system failure. I understand that technical issues happen and they can be beyond the control of any employees. But I ask, where was the foresight in attempting a massive computer system overhaul prior to one of the busiest weekend of the season?? Being an EDC sponsored hotel with and incoming of +300,000 guests to Vegas, a Manny Pacquiao Fight, Stanley Cup Finals, and NBA Playoffs? Aria did little, and by little I mean nothing, to compensate for the wait, computer meltdown, and inconvenience other than putting out some stanchions  to make it feel like a ride and handing out bottles of water. We aren't thirsty we are tired from a 4 hour drive or a plane trip. We got things to do and nowhere on a person's weekend plans should it include standing in line for hours with little information on the status of the situation.

We were 10 minutes away from booking a room at the Paris down the way that boasted no lines and a rapid check-in as we were on a tight schedule when FINALLY they opened the check-in counters and started the process. We were near the front luckily and got through surprisingly fast from that point on. I'll give the hotel that, their staff handled it like an all-hands-on-deck black friday sale. By the end of the trip our promises of compensation seemed to be unfamiliar to the front desk upon check out. After ten minutes back and forth we got the resort fees removed from our room and oddly enough our total still came out higher than what we allegedly booked for through ARIA and EDC's "Great Deal". At the end of the day this was Aria's second chance to impress me. It was my return visit there. And even the first time, on a friday night, mid January, with no line at all, it took us a 45 minutes to check-in after the front desk couldn't find our reservation...

This hotel looks great, something straight out of the future and it's a real testament to modern architecture. It's luxurious to the pinnacle of definition all the way down to the perfume adorned air to the auto curtains that slide open upon entering your room. But aside from all the aesthetic oooh's and aaah's this place soils itself when it comes down to the brass tax and the fundamental functions of any good business, that is of course, customer service. For the amount of money you spend here, it would behoove you to spend it at some place just as nice and with service that far surpasses this place. Cosmo, Venitian, or Encore are fine choices.This is a really nice place but housekeeping needs to take better care of the rooms. The first two nights the room was not as clean as it should have been and the cleaning person on the third night did a really good job. Other than that, staff was great and resort is beautiful. Plus it doesn't charge for parking.I chose this resort because it was listed as a 5-star resort in my B of A credit card's rewards section. I had thousands of B of A rewards points saved up, so I figured it was high time I took advantage of them... and happened to have a 4-day trip to Scottsdale coming up.

Where I went wrong was by not doing further research. If I had reviewed other sites, such as this one, I would've avoided it and gladly paid more to stay somewhere else.

Tonight is my last night here--I check out tomorrow morning--and I can't wait to leave. As I set here, I'm sleep-deprived and covered in mysterious bug bites.

THE GOOD

- The staff is friendly and helpful. The young lady who checked me in was pleasant and courteous. The front desk sent housekeeping to remove the pink silly-string from my ceiling (she joked with me that they had found this in other units as well). However, these are baseline customer service requirements. I consider this is "the bar"--the minimum level I would expect from any reputable establishment that isn't a dive.

- Location. Close proximity to everything you could want... food, fun, etc.

- Price isn't bad at all, but you get what you pay for.

THE BAD:

- Bugs in, on, and around the beds. Possibly bed bugs? At first, I ignored them--thinking that 1 or 2 bugs was no big deal. But by my 3rd night (tonight), I've realized it's more of an infestation. Watch long enough, and you'll see the little guys scurrying across the white comforters. When I pulled out my night stand, I saw 3-4 scurry away from the light. I've realized they're all throughout the beds... behind headboards, in the mattresses, etc. I now have an explanation for the half-dozen or so itchy bites on my body. I have to go to sleep here in the next hour, and I'm dreading it. I can't wait to be done with this nightmare.

- This place is obviously "older," and this shows in many ways. Additionally, it doesn't appear that any attempts have been made to renovate or update.

- The furniture in my unit is old, stained, and the cushions are compressed and sagging.

- The carpet is old, stained, and torn at the edges.

- My 2nd day (Saturday), I had my "DnD" sign out all day, because I didn't need room service and wanted to take a nap. So, room service actually CALLS ME and wakes me up... basically asking "Do you REALLY mean you don't want to be disturbed, or would you mind if we come clean anyway?" Are you serious!? So much for my nap.

This was a mistake--the most unpleasant aspect of my visit to Scottsdale. My trip would've been perfect if I'd just stayed somewhere else. I can not and would not recommend this "resort" to anyone.This place has gone down hill, this was my 3rd visit and my last.  I have nicer towels for my car and a little bleach wouldn't hurt.  The receptionist Heather was the least helpful person I've come across.  The saving grace was Bryce, nice guy, super helpful.Should've read yelp reviews before venturing here. Like one yelper mentioned the place smells funny. Was thinking of walking out but we didn't. My friend ordered the burrito. There was nothing special about it. It was pretty big though. I ordered the carne verde too much verde sauce ~ my pork was swimming in it. It tasted like the bottled verde sauce. Accompanied with Spanish rice and refried beans. Nothing really stood out. I wasn't looking for fine dining. Place is dingy and dirty. Our food came out about 5 seconds after ordering it, ok, I'm exaggerating it was more like 5 mins which made me believe their food was pre-made and probably nuked. Really not worth it and a waste of stomach space.I have been to this place over 10 times...  I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst...  What gives?  Each time we go, I hope it gets better.  Nope...  The service has gotten worst too.  Hum, I might not return again...  But my husband loves the place...So dissappointing.   Moved to LV a little over a year ago.  Asked around for best buffet, and was told repeatedly that it was the M.  Went there for Seafood Brunch - Fantastic!  Have gone back several times with out of town visitors.   But, something has changed.  Now, not only would I not go again (after two bad outings), I won't be taking anyone there.   

Sunday, went for the breakfast buffet- $10.  Awful.  Most pans were either empty, or in need of a refill.  I finally got a serving of Eggs Benedict (my favorite) - muffin wasn't even cooked, let alone warm.  Egg: over done.  Didn't finish it).   Line for "cooked to order eggs" was ridiculously out of hand - they had the line following the buffet, making easily 1/3 of it next to impossible to access (Management, Really?  Don't you see how this is ineffective?  I would have had that line re-routed within 5 minutes, and I don't even work in F&B industry).  

Today, I played at the M so I earned a 'free' lunch buffet.  Line wasn't long, so I went on in.  After I paid, I still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  Once I was allowed entry, I was escorted to  my table, passing by many empty tables and many tables that needed to be cleared.  Food was just 'meh'.  

True that the desserts are plentiful and tasty - but the same every time I've been there.  No variety.  Not worth it.

Sorry Studio B - whatever changes have happened, you've lost 2 customers in my husband & me.Old location was great and had character. Now it's overpriced, average food and ambiance is lackluster.You know I simply don't understand why so many mediocre restaurants get such high ratings here in Phoenix.  Is it because many of the patrons have not been to true 4 and 5 star restaurants?  Postino's on Central falls into the mediocre category for me and my guy.  The décor is quite nice and inviting but the wine list is uninteresting and limited.  I was under the impression that a wine bar features many types of wines that range from the modest to the spectacular?

The meal that I had was over the top with the sweetness that simply overpowered my pallet.  I had the Italian Picnic salad with the Prosciutto w/ Brie, which was a hot greasy mess.  I think I got the Panini from the reject basket, it looked not so hot, was difficult to eat and again with the too sweet fig jam, overkill for sure.  

I tried 3 different wines, which were decent but uninteresting and waaay overpriced.  I guess I was expecting more diversity and higher quality, which was not the case.

As for the staff, ladies please lose the attitude; you are not that pretty or cool.  The hostess was very unwelcoming and quite unpleasant.  The male wait staff seemed to have less attitude and at least made us feel that we weren't putting them out.  

If this Postino's lost the hipster, too cool attitude and actually got some great wines on their menu and tasted the food before it went out, it actually might be a 4  1/2 star wine bar.  But I can see from the reviews that I am in the minority so I'm sure nothing will change.   Too bad because we live in the neighborhood."Much smaller place than expected. " That was my first thought when I saw the place. But oh well. Met with some friends here and they already chose the items to order for dinner because we had a comp. Ended up getting lobster (so not worth the money!), sea bass clay pot (yum!), oysters on sizzling plate (so not worth it! It was chewy and barely any oysters anyways) and also peking duck... which I guess was decent. They didn't even give us any plum sauce for the duck, just the hoisin for the skin in the buns.

Service sucked. Had to ask for water a couple times and they couldn't even just bring one per person and had to ask how many glasses. And same with rice. Which chinese food doesn't give you rice with dinner?!? So for that they asked how many bowls also.

Most chinese restaurants bring you a dessert after the meal (not additional cost or anything.) but they did not do that here. It was near impossible to even get the check! In such a small restaurant that seems to be fully staffed on a not very busy day, service really sucked!

Food was average... and I don't even know the prices since it was comped. I would not recommend this place for Chinese.I expected so much more. The food here was eatable, there wasn't much variety. The "sushi" was rice and veggie rolls. I'm not coming back.We came over an hour before closing and were told they were no longer seating anyone.  The restaurant was about half full.  We found out we could sit at the bar, so of course we did.  First off, peanut butter frozen hot chocolate...amazing. (and seems simple to make at home)  now the fun stuff, the bartender was arrogant and a jackass.  We also had the nachos...awful.  They tasted like they were made with roasted plastic, the chips were oily and overall a bad choice.  I should have gotten the steak sandwich or the pizza like my neighbors, looked great. I say go, but don't look beyond the desserts.So my friend and I checked this place out from here great reviews from friends and family as they said the deserts were good.  But after reading other comments on Yelp, I was pretty skeptic (like all other reviews) because it's all relevant as what's good for you or not as everyone has different taste.  

But when the hostess and server doesn't really seem like they have any interest in serving you in anyway, I just want to get out ASAP.  I understand with a huge line that they must be tired or cranky as the line didn't seem to die down a bit but boy the look and the tone of voice they use were not friendly at all.  

So going back to the food, my friend and I ordered one sundae as I was told they were big, and it was pretty good as well as I love sweets.  But the deserts weren't anything mouth watering as it tasted similar to any sundaes I had.  For $15 bucks, I can't really say it was worth it.  

Now, going back to the waiter who served me, at first he seemed super nice as when I asked about what he recommanded, he seemed very determined to help me.  It was when I was paying, he took my check and cash but when he gave it to me, just threw the check holder right front of my face...my friend looking all shocked.  So I took the change and since my seat was right next to the computer where he was working at, he just looked away doing something...no "Have a great day,"  or "thanks, hope to see you soon.." Nothing.  

I get better service at any local teriyaki stores that has one server that does everything.  =PThis is a review for their TOGO food menu:

I ordered the works hot-dog. A foot long, and $11. Worth it? I think not. Go towards the Venetian from Quad and you'll see a foot long selling for $2. The pizza my friend ordered (BBQ Chicken) is probably more worth your money but still not amazing either. And no free tap water, really? Oh Vegas, how you dehydrate us. 

I feel like my experience might have been better if I did sit down inside the restaurant rather than taking togo. But maybe another day if I'm in the mood for frozen hot chocolate.I was lured in by the street side billboard offering a Large pepperoni pizza for $5.00-and as they say you get what you pay for.

It was fast & they were real nice and the prices on everything on the menu are real reasonable but...

When I first opened the box I thought they had given me a cheese pizza but quickly i realized they just put the chesse ON TOP.

I have had many a pizza and this was a 1st...the pizza was cheap and nothing to write home about..actually it was another 1st in my house. 1st pizza to NOT get finished.

I wouldn't bother with the pizza here again but I'd give their other stuff a try.Food - 4 stars- We had some really tasty burger sliders and pulled pork sliders. The homemade chips were delicious albeit heavy.

Service - 1 star- Although our waitress was as sweet as pie, the time it took for her to bring our drinks and foods was inexcusable. We also had a 20 minute wait to get seated when there were literally 10 people in the restaurant. 

Atmosphere - 3 stars- I could imagine that the place might be jumpin at night but we were there for lunch and it was DEAD. The mechanical bull is a nice touch though.

If it weren't for a groupon I wouldn't have ever ventured into this place considering Blue Martini and Yard House are close by. It's also pricey, which I wouldn't mind if everything else was up to par.I placed a large to go order. It was placed into boxes and was being bagged when the drive thru/manager got an order for a single meal. She took one of my biscuits and gave it to the drive thru order thus making me wait 5+ minutes for the next batch was made?!!

She put my order on hold to keep her drive thru times down. I was ordering for a family and the drive thru was a single to go order; pray tell which one should be more important? 

My search continues for a clean store with good service!The new set-up is terrible.  The old stand under the trees was great.  The new stand in the middle of the compost is terrible.  It smelled liked I was shopping for food at the dump.  The ambiance carried this place in the past and somewhat justified the high prices, but I will definitely not go out of my way to experience the dirt and dust pile that you have created now.Came here for a late dinner snack (around 10pm).

I was not impressed. I've been to many BWW and have experience great service. I have no idea if it was because it was late and they were tired or they just didn't care...

My date and I walked in and there was no one around to greet us. We didn't want to seat ourselves so waited a good few minutes before someone popped his head up to greet us. He was sitting in a booth... watching the game on the giant screen. Um, what the heck? That really irritated me. 

We put in our orders, got the food and started eating. Then, they started vacuuming! It wasn't super loud or super close to our booth but I was annoyed. Totally ruined the whole experience.

I most likely will only go back to this BWW if I am in the area.Meh, thats really the first word that jumps into my mind when I think about my experiences at Toby Keiths. I went to the one in Vegas at the Harrahs Casino and it was ok, nothing special though. Very loud and crazy bar, at least that location is. Mesa location is a bit tamer but still kinda crazy. Food was typical bar food (burgers, fried food, etc) on both occasions (Vegas and this location), drinks were ok, service was fine both times. I can't really complain but this is not one of those places I would not choose to go to. Typical sports bar in my opinion. A couple of positives I can say is that they do make a hella good fried twinkie dessert and the waiters at the Mesa location are hilarious and a blast. Bottom line, this is one of those places you go to party, be loud and obnoxious. If you are looking for a quiet place with tasty terrific food, you will most likely not find it here.I've hear that Toby Keith's song about his bar says something like "never a cover charge". On Wednesday night there was a $5 cover charge for guys. Then the door people handed me a card saying that there were $1 domestic beers for guys until 10pm. So we went to the bar and, after some delay, the bartender asked me, "Would you like a short one or a tall one?" I said a tall one, so he brings me a 32oz. mason jar with Blue Moon (a domestic) with a slice of orange. He said, "That'll be $9." Some other guy later on that night said he also got ripped off that way, too.
Even the ladies were paying a lot for alcohol, $7.50 for shots of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey. The place was pretty dead except for our party. The sound system was good, although too loud and we did get some dancing in.Huge warehouse like bar and grill with strange Djs that play country along with hip hop and rap tracks to throw everyone off. The funny thing is that most people are dancing to the twerk songs rather than the 2 step! Its an average bar with average food and average girls.The only complete dud at CityCenter. Confusing layout with people wandering around lost, still lots of big areas of emptiness. There weren't many people looking in the stores, and NO ONE was buying. Give it two years and it'll have a GAP and a Barnes & Noble.Food was very tasty but no left over. Very light on the spaghetti  sauce and the meat ball was very dry. Service was one of the worst I have seen. I will try it again the other foods at the table were great. Hopefully the service will be better. I will repost after my next visit.I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. Don't get me wrong, it has an awesome atmosphere.. but, it's way too snooty to be a sport's bar(which is what it claims to be.)The food was good, but not nearly as good as it should be considering what you're paying for it--yes, it's pricey (for what is essentially bar food.) Our server was just flat-out rude... We just never felt welcome in there.   It is however, a great place to watch a game (there's tv's at every booth)..Other than that though, not a place to write home about.Slappers.

Drunks.

Cheap paintstripper booze.

Awful music.

Violence.

Same as pretty much any other nightclub then. Awful.The Positive - Nice Ambiance!

Major Disappointment - 
On one of my flights back from Europe saw a documentary about Master SOMM - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUunwFZFqZo

There are apx 205 Master SOMM in the world and one was working at Sage!  

How excited I was being a passionate wine lover and having had the rare chance to visit some of the finest and exclusive wineries in Boudreaux &Napa. My knowledge of wine is far limited as compared to that of a Master SOMM. When I can save up a few shillings I take the opportunity to indulge my senses (with the family) and get pampered in the culinary arms of world renowned (Michelin) chefs where the service is usually bar none and with it put the local SOMM to the test.  

There are hidden treasures and with this is the opportunity for me to get a chance to experience through the help of a SOMM (local usually as there are only 205 Master SOMM in the world) and give them a reasonable price range to choose a wine after describing the flavors and style of wine I am in search of.  99.9% of the time the SOMM comes back with a bottle I have never heard of and causes a frenzy in my search for more!  

Well, guess what this Master SOMM came back with- Chateauneuf Du Pape - (Similar to one I can pick up at one of the local Costco) -

To add to the insult, we ordered the tasting menu and when the runners brought the dishes their passion to explain each dish runs off like a bullet train at 1000 mph only to leave you guessing about the dish you are about to sink your fork into.

While the flavors of the food were actually decent this place treats you like a Vegas hop on hop off bus, just another number Baby!My husband and I met a friend in Vegas for lunch and we went here. Well this place was a disappointment. The only reason they are getting any stars is for their customer service because their food gets nothing. They have a very basic menu which is way over priced and the food tastes awful. I was very disappointed because the restaurant is beautiful and I expected better. I do not really have much to say because the place was so basic and blah it is really unmemorable. It is way overpriced and I recommend easting elsewhere. You can get the same quality food at Dennys for alot cheaper. Their customer service is great though.Not impressed.  If it had not been for friends staying at the Aria as a local I probably would have never experienced this breakfast.   I ordered the Seaside Benedict.   That wasn't too bad.  I enjoyed the crab cake twist on a classic but for $20 the hash browns that accompanied the meal were as hard as hockey pucks.  To top it off service was lacking.  I ordered an ice tea when we first sat down and everyone received their drink but me so I flagged down a passing waitress and requested my drink again.  And then about 20 minutes after that our main waitress bought out my drink order not realizing I had already requested another one and received it.    

What I did like about this place is the atmosphere.  To me it had a futuristic kind of feel like where I might imagine the Jetsons would land for Sunday brunch.   I don't think I will be returning here unless it's not of my choice because the meal and experience I received shouldn't have cost more then $10-12.all i have to say about the buffet here is BLECH...it's not SO bad that it gets only 1 star, but it's far inferior to buffets i've tried elsewhere in vegas (i.e. bellagio)...especially for the price...for roughly $35/person, it's money better spent elsewhere...and actually, now that i think about it, yuck, i would not eat here again

like most vegas buffets, they had an assortment of cuisines, but nothing really stood out...they had king crab legs, prime rib, steak, turkey and sushi stations...sure it SOUNDS good, but don't let your eyes and ears trick you...everything tasted a little off, i feel like nothing was fresh! and i would DEFINITELY avoid the sushi and i'm pretty sure the shrimp was the thaw and serve kind...also, each person get's HALF a lobster with their meal...but again, didn't taste that fresh and they don't clean them very well so it wasn't a very appetizing presentation...and when i mean not clean them very well, lobster poo was still all up in there...i know for some folks out there, they just eat that sh*t up, but for me, no thanks because seriously, do you serve kobe beef with a side of poo, no!

so overall review, either their food had been sitting out for awhile, or it was thaw and serve...blech blech blech...i mean, for it to be in the ARIA hotel and have TROPICANA quality buffet, i would totally skip

desserts were AWFUL...the selection was limited and again, nothing tasted quite right...i would go with the creme brulee, i mean seriously, you have to be tastebudless to get that classic dessert wrong

not to sound like a lush, but the only saving grace is the fact they had unlimited wine included in the $35...i'm sure it's boxed wine, but compared to the tasteless slop they were serving, the wine tasted like rainbows

oh, FYI, after dinner (and for the rest of the night) i had the worst heartburn/stomach ache...i'm convinced it was the lobster!I think this place is a tad overrated- first off I went here for breakfast while en route to Mandalay for a convention. We show up- there are no signs that tell you where to line up when you're approaching from the casino level- by the time we saw that there was an actual "line" we'd been waiting and they felt sorry for us and let us through. The "server" if you'd call her that was bloody awful- she literally slammed my drink on the table- is Aria telling me that there isn't talent in Vegas that actually cares about customer service? Now on to the food- pancakes were hard - yuck and also no maple syrup- only berry toppings- WTF it's a brand new hotel not the Nugget! I would choose other places over this joint for the price.Pretty low end for a purported high end hotel. Price is good ($20) for lunch but it really seemed like a larger version of the Old Country Buffet. Nothing very surprising or interesting to choose from though the Indian station was a bit different.  Crab legs were a bit suspect, too.  I'd save my money and go to a better hotel buffet (Wynn, Paris, Bellagio).Buffet is worth 4.95 very dissapointing coming from Aria. Only French toast, tofu salald and gelato were good.

The wait and price totally not worth it, save your Vegas Money and go somewhere else!!How utterly disappointing this place was! I was responsible for deciding where to eat since I'm on yelp all the time. I decided to lead my group here since this place got decent reviews and it was in our hotel. 

Atmosphere was good. Very dark place and it was pretty empty on a Sunday night. Ambiance is nice for a date since it seems like a intimate and casual location. 

Service was friendly and there was no complaints there. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. 

Food was...well, how can I say this nicely...overpriced and overall disappointing. The food I ordered wasn't BAD, but definitely wasn't worth the price we paid. I ordered the sampler that came with the buffalo chicken lollipops, walnut shrimp, and philly cheesesteak dumplings. All three tasted great, but cost $30 total. RIDICULOUS!!!!! Portions were tiny. Granted the shrimp were more like jumbo prawns, but that does NOT warrant the price I paid. Yes...I understand location and rent and blah blah blah..but that's just ridiculous for such simple food. My friends ordered entrees that were priced pretty high as well and they were unimpressed with the steak and pasta dishes. I also ordered the Doritos Mac and Cheese and felt that it did not have a good cheese consistency. I've had better...way better. 

I was expecting some thrilling food experience, but left with emptier pockets and sad faces. I failed my friends on this yelp-based food adventure.Granted, the restaurant selection in Chandler is slim and pretty generic. And the Ocotillo district, though it aspires to become "the next Scottsdale," has a way to go....the area billed as "downtown Ocotillo" is, in reality, just a mid-sized strip mall.

So by those standards, The Egg and I is pretty decent....the food's not bad and the portions are generous.

But the service...I can sugar-coat it if you like, but in a nutshell, it just plain sucks. 

I arrive with my wife and kids, we have four people ahead of us on the list, and we're told 10-15 minutes...not bad for a Sunday morning. Never mind that we can see four tables, all clean and available...we wait patiently, and after 15 our hostess leads us past two empty booths and three empty tables to a table in the back, with rickety chairs, by the kitchen entrance, and within sniffing distance of the rest rooms. We ask if we can have a booth instead, and are told they're reserved. 

Meanwhile, two groups of four who arrived after us get seated right away, and are being brought their drinks while we're still waiting for any one of six, count 'em, six waitresses to even look at us. Waitresses are running past us every 30 seconds (like I said...we're right in front of the kitchen), and every one of them actually avoids my eye contact....as do the three waitresses standing gabbing with their customers. (I'm not talking about taking their orders...I'm talking about "how did you like the movie," and "my brother's playing football this weekend" kind of gabbing.) If the place was slow, I could see it...but when you've got customers sitting there being ignored, that's just rude.

After 10 minutes of this I get up and go to the front and ask the manager why. She smiles sweetly and tells me their reserved customers get preference in seating. I ask if they also get preference in service and civility....I get a blank look. Either she's considering the question carefully, or she's trying to figure out what "civility" means. 

In the end, she sends us a waitress. The food was actually not bad...not worth the extra 15 minutes between sitting down and ordering it, but not bad. And she knocked a bit off the check to make up for it, which I wasn't counting on....a smart practice for any restaurant that wants to see a disgruntled customer return. That said, my wife was even more annoyed than I was, and I doubt we'll be returning any time soon.Work done OK.  Pricing was quite high.  On-time and fixed/upfront pricing as advertised.  Left me with an "iffy" feeling about way additional services pitched/quoted.

While turning the water back on after installing a new toilet, I managed to somehow strip the main service shut off valve (old fashioned), leaving us with ~20% water flow to the house.  So, we needed a pretty quick fix.   Called Benjamin Franklin because timing was important (just wanted to get it done).

Technician showed up mid-way through the 3-hour promised window.  Was general courteous/professional.  Explained the issue (needed a new shut-off valve) and inquired about pricing for a new hose bib and pressure regulator (all at the same exterior plumbing location on the house).

Was shown a book of standard pricing and a written quote sheet was filled out (definitely had the aggressive car dealer feel... move forward, fast, no questions).  Shut-off valve replacement (w/ service charge for showing up - which was disclosed at appointment time) was almost $470.  Another $585 for a pressure regulator and $285 for a new hose bib.   I declined the latter two given the pricing.   It just seemed way off given that the regulator would actually be installed in-line with the new shut-off valve which was 4 inches down the line from the hose bib.  I'm not comfortable sweating pipes in myself, but have seen it done and understand the basics - the quote seemed way out of line in general - and way, way out of line to do at the same time.

Anyway, work proceeded.  The technician shut-off the service at the meter and then ??? for 20 minutes... not sure... then he came to the door and told me he was going to leave for a while to get parts while water drained out of the house (huh?).   It seemed odd to me given how few and how common the parts were.  It was even more odd given that the guy showed up in a rolling parts closet and the business advertises how they carry all the parts they need with them.  Whatever.

After about 1.5 hours, the tech returned and finished the job.  I'm not a plumber, but the workmanship seemed fine to me.  It functioned as expected.

Bottom line it was a shady, overpriced experience, but I made the conscious decision to proceed - the hassle was bigger than the money or suspicion, and the contracted job was completed satisfactorily.

I would not use this service again in the future.   It could be ignorance on my part, but I feel the prices don't justify the service, and I definitely got the impression that they are comfortable exploiting clients ignorance for any purpose if/when they feel the customer isn't knowledgeable about plumbing.Loved this location so much but the last three visits included a 10 minute wait in line and they still said, "pull around and wait for the food" - way to pull best practices from all the other shitty fast food joints.

At least the guy was honest and said he gave our food to the car ahead of us and needed to recook everything. 

Advice: go to another location!!!I have given Anthony's two chances to get and it right and have been disappointed.  The service is slow even when the restaurant is empty. I have gone on my lunch hour and been late back to work. On my second visit, every table around me got served before my pizza came, even though I was the first table seated.  I am assuming something went wrong with my order but the server didn't feel the need to tell me.  While I was waiting, the host staff couldn't be more bored and was talking loudly at the front of the restaurant.

As for the food, someone needs to tell the cook that coal fired pizza doesn't mean burned pizza. A layer of soot on the bottom of my pizza isn't artisan cooking, it's a clear sign the equipment is not be used properly. I do not think I will give this place a third try.I don't quiet understand all the good reviews for this place. If I could divide this review into two different categories of service and food, I would. I would give 4 stars to service. I went there for the first time and didn't know the menu. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helped me pick something out of the menu. They had a lunch special but somehow we ended up paying way too much for just lunch. And that brings us to the second category: Food. 

I'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs "dill sauce" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava. 

First of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite. 

My recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely. Also, if you are looking for a more authentic taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, you might want to try Stephanos' or Baladie Cafe (my favorite).Looking for an early lunch (11 am early) could sometimes  be a challenge. I was so excited to find a place that was literally around the corner from me. I'm unsure what my expectations were. I knew that this would be a "nice restaurant" = expensive which i have NO problem with.HOWEVER, when I'm spending $100 on two people, I expect to have little to no issues when it comes to the taste of my food.

I got the lobster bisque which tasted like a clam chowder wih no clams or potatoes. I had to SALT IT TO DEATH before it had any taste. I can't say that I was too upset about that due to the "soup of the day" only being $5. I ordered an apple martini that was probably the best thing I ordered there. I had the half chicken with potatoes and spinach I think..which was ok. I really feel like I could've done better myself at home due to the lack of flavor on the potatoes and spinach, My chicken had blood coming out of it. My bf had the flank steak and fries.They brought the flank steak and fries out at first and he wasn't impressed. When the waiter came back with the "sauce" for the flank steak that he forgot, my bf was so excited becase he figured the sauce would bring it ALL TOGETHER. Not so. Not so. The best thing about this place is the scenery and service. Our waitress was nice and the view of the lake was awesome. If I go back, it would be for drinks and a nice view.I also purchased on of the chocolate mani/pedi groupons.  I agree with several of the other posts that say it took forever to actually get in for an appointment!  I called several times, and I finally got a Sat appoint, but literally booked it a month in advance!  The layout is really strange too.  I don't get my nails done THAT often, so when I treat myself, I like the full sha-bang.  You will not find that here.  I love the big chairs you normally sit in for a pedicure that soaks your feet while giving you a massage-- not here.   At R Salon you will find yourself sitting at the nail station with your feet in one of those at home pedi soakers.  I used to have one years ago and tossed it because it splashes water all over the place!  

The nail polish colors are rather limited for a salon, but they do use high-end brands like Essie and OPI, which is expected.  The service itself was quite good.  My tech was super nice and sweet- and she did a really good job with the mani/pedi.  My only complaint about her was that she would stop and check her Blackberry AND respond to emails WHILE she was doing my nails!  

That is just common courtesy 101... all in all, I feel I got my money's worth with the groupon but I've received better service at a regular ol' nail salon.  I definitely would not pay full price and probably wouldn't buy another groupon if I saw one.my friend lin was visiting me from albany,ny and after picking her up at the airport, we
stopped by about 6 o'clock, before going to my home close by.
the food was good, chicken marcella and chicken parmizon.
we waited and waited and waited for bread and water, however, we were met by
too many attendants (3-4), each watching and switching plates of butter, glasses,etc.
the main server came by too many times, and i was ANNOYED by him!  was he
wanting a higher tip?
the prices were too, too high for this kind of strip-mall place.   2 dinners were
over $40, plus a small tip.

will not go back for this kind of treatment. however, my friend (who was
starving, made a pig of herself, by slopping the hard bread lots of times in the
chicken sauce.  hope no one saw her (she was in the middle of a divorce.Lots of hype for nothing. I've had better waffles, chicken, grits, etc. elsewhere. The service and staff there were upbeat and fun. I'm glad I didn't have to wait. If you want to try it, go early for breakfast.Not the BEST Mexican food I've ever had, but this was the best, non-fast food option I could find in terminal C at the Phoenix airport.

My tamales, beans and rice were good but could have been better. The service was fast--I bet they are used to serving customers who need to eat quickly.First impression was...cool a Mom & Pops kind of place. I'm from New England and thought yum, fried clams, fish & chips. Fries were not so good, overcooked! Had two pieces of fish. One was overcooked and the other was fine. Everything tasted like old grease to me. My husband liked the fried clams and cole slaw and hush puppies. He thought it was kind of old grease too.
Didn't like the idea of the cooks bare hands handling my fish when it was dropped into the deep fat fryer especially since he had just taken money from a customer at the register for an order. YUCK, wished I hadn't have seen that. Please wear gloves!!!!! All Cooked orders were handled with tongs...that's good.
Won't be going back but glad we tried it.The cheesy bread was awesome.  The pizza was a mess.  Good beers, people at my table said.  The root beer was pretty fine.  But, when cheese and sauce is just falling everywhere, and when the attention to detail is not Lou Malnati's quality, I dock points on my ratings.This places is ok. It's right by UNLV, in a boarded up building, no windows so no natural light. 

It's also a one man show. The bartender makes the bar food, serves the food, pours the drafts and does the tours of the cellar. This means if you want to actually ask questions about the beer your not going to get much dialogue since he's just too busy right now...and for the rest of the night. 

They have a great beer selection for pretty much any taste but I thought it was really overpriced. We paid 20 dollars for two beers. They were good, but I can also buy them for under 3.5 at Total Wine and More and get the same level of service. 

What I mean to say is frogs didn't cultivate the experience of going out so what's the point of paying more? I'll just buy and pour it myself.My wife and I decided to check out this lounge as we've heard so much about it.  We were very disappointed with the entire Mandarin Oriental experience.  We've heard so much about their 5 Star service that we had our hopes up.

We walked from Aria to Mandarin Oriental.  You have to walk down a long set of stairs to get to the entrance.  On the way down, we noticed how filthy the stairs were.  I realize it is windy, but 5 Star properties shouldn't have trash on stairs like that.  There was a lot of trash too.

Our next disappointment was that there was no doorman to open the door for you.  I don't want to sound like a snob, but I thought that was a requirement for a 5 Star property.  Well, there were none.

Then the two employees in the lobby didn't greet us.  They ignored us while we looked around for the elevators.  We had to approach one of them to ask how to get to the lounge.  He was busy texting someone on his cell phone....hmm....5 Star service?

When we arrived at the lounge, we were very impressed by the decor.  Again, it shocked us because there were 2 employees behind this huge desk and not one of them greeted us.  We were well dressed and looked proper, so I don't know what the deal was.  Anyway, we were finally seated in the lounge and our waitress spilled the water when she filled my wife's glass, but didn't clean up the spill on the table.....what?  and she poured across the table instead of next to us....wow, that's 3 Star service 101 and they can't get it right here?

The wine selection was very good and the Cabernet I ordered was fantastic.  The views from the lounge are spectacular.  That's the only reason why this place got 2 Stars....I was very tempted to give it 1, but the ambience, decor, and quality of the wine gave it the extra Star.

Normally this kind of stuff doesn't bother me, but we wanted a 5 Star experience....we could have spent much less money somewhere else and received better service.  Maybe they had an off day....I dunno.

Will I return?  Because of the brand name, I will give this place another chance.They say it's all about location, location, location and if that's the case then this would probably be the world's best hotel. But I'd say it's also about character, service and getting what you pay for.

I was in here for cocktails with a friend a while ago, and it was my first time ever in the place. I have to say, it was pretty soul-less. Being part of the Barceló chain, you know it's always going to be more or less the same standard as any of their other hotels in terms of cleanliness, prices etc but the bar area definitely lets them down in this one.

For starters, although it's open to non-residents (in fact, they usually have a blackboard outside on North Bridge plugging their latest drinks deals) there are no signs or directions or anything when you walk in to the reception area. This wouldn't have been a problem if any one of the half dozen or so members of staff around had been willing to help or even acknowledge that we'd walked in.

When we eventually found it, the table we sat at was dirty. Not a good start. We saw from looking around that you waited at your table to order your drinks rather than going to the bar yourself, so we waited... and waited... and waited. After nearly ten minutes we went up to the bar, only to find that half of the things on their cocktail list were out of stock.

Then we had the same problem with the bill. We'd asked for it, but then waited another good 10 minutes or so before going up to the bar to pay. It wasn't even busy either; I could have counted on one hand the number of other tables that were occupied, so I don't really know why the service was so slow.

The cocktails themselves were great, which is why I'm not giving it 1 star. Apart from that, not great really.I had high hopes for this place.  I mean really, Emeril Lagasse and hyped as  "the best sports experience in Las Vegas" pumped me up for the visit.  Man was I disappointed.  The best thing I can say about this place is they have televisions at each table and just about everywhere you look.   Other than that, there is no comfort feel to this restaurant/sports book.  The menu is over priced.  Based on my experience at other Emeril locations, I expected creative twists on bar favorties.  However, there is little creativity here. The menu items are basic traditional fare with little or no "bam" that Emeril is famous for.  It almost seems like they slapped Emeril's name on the restaurant and added one or two pseudo emeril meal choices just to get people in the door.  I will say that it is easy to place bets here and you won't miss any of the action but I expected much much more.What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.Went for dinner with folks. Service spotty, starters awful, main course was OK. Mom ordered Chardonnay, for which the only descriptive word she could find was "Ganges".

I am told that lunch buffet is good. I would not recommend for dinner.Please note this hotel is FAR from the strip.  You can see it but you definitely cannot walk to it.  The hotel charges to use their shuttle: $5. Cabs swing by some of the time.  The lobby is nice and the rooms are decorated well but the one we were checked into SMELLED FOUL.  We asked maintenance to come to the room and he confirmed it as did the housekeeping staff.  It smelled like rotten laundry/unclean towels/fungus feet.  So management switched our room and while it was better temporarily, as soon as you showered, the smell returned.  The only plus is that it is within walking distance of the tapas restaurant Firefly. Oh, and there is no free breakfast.Be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes and pay 10 bucks for a sandwich and cookie at this place.  The food is good, but definitely not worth the high price and long wait.  (The wait time is purely slow staff, usually the place is empty or half full).my third visit; and i gotta say that they really cut back since they opened a while ago. when they first opened everything was first class!... now its no class-FAIL!!! employees at the meat/seafood counter were not engaginging and rough around the edges- maybe its just me but i dont like being called "bud" and "pal" by people that are supposed to be taking care of me. selection has gone way down since opening; the worst was the produce! i can believe i could not find one decent nectarine, peach or plum, during peak stone fruit season. so sad but i guess they have to cut back like everybody else.I've eaten at Jollibee in Daly City, the PI and this location in Las Vegas as well as the one on the east side of town. So for this location 3 Stars for the Food, it's Hit or Miss, Never Consistent. 1 Star for Service; compared to the PI, I miss the Hundreds of Employees offering their Help and Eagerness to Clean and take your Trash, but here It takes them Forever to take your order and it takes Longer than that to get your food. -5 Stars, that's right Negative 5, for their Lack of AC, ESPECIALLY during the Summer! We first assumed it was just Broken, but after Several of Years of them being in business and experiencing Hot Oven like conditions, we're now Speculating they have a Crappy AC system or they are just a bunch of Cheapskates for not wanting to pay their Electric Bill! It's Las Vegas for goodness sakes! We live in a Desert, it gets to 120 degrees in the Summer! Heck even all the Jollibees in the PI all seemed to have Sufficient AC!A little behind on my reviews.... 

Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends. 

We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders. 

Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza. 

Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish. 

Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute. 

Manager too sounded confused and surprised... "Don't know why food would be cold?" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries... 

Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too. 

I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants. This will not be a place I would consider again unless the timing for Happy Hour presents itself...I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.

Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?

Really?!I really, really wanted to get something from this place.  It was cheery and clean, and helpfully sorted out everything by size and color.  But I could NOT justify some of the price tags.  I mean, I usually do most of my secondhand shopping at Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads, so I know what the upcharge for these stores should be.  The shirt I ended up falling in love with was a Cynthia Steffe for $28, and at the end of the day I just couldn't do it.

Do you and your wallet a favor and go to the Goodwill down the street.  Same selection, quarter of the price.S.L.O.W. service.
It wasn't even busy when I went in. ONE person getting ONE drink ahead of me.

I place my order for a large honey vanilla latte with soy. Wait almost ten minutes. They wrote soy on the cup.  The barrista spent plenty of extra time making the foam at the top look like a swan. If I was drinking it there, that would have been nice. I ordered it to go. It was getting a lid on it and going to my car. I don't need pretty. I need caffeine!
He announced "honey vanilla latte." I added, "soy?" And he said, "no."

He took the cup back, and started again.

I went in for a quick latte to go - on my way to work.

Total time - close to 20 minutes.

Not Okay.

That said - the latte was quite good. I may go back for another one. When I have lots of time to sit and sip and not care what the clock says.I'm Korean so I know what korean food tastes bad or good. The kimchi was good but the soup was not so great and I've tasted sooo much better! The service was a bit bad also, only one lady working while the owner is just sitting around drinking beer and watching T.V. Our lady server spilled the rice bowl on the floor causing a bit of commotion. In one of our orders, they forgot the cow meat in the soup and just gave us the plain soup. We informed her and 10 minutes later she brings out the cow meat in a different bowl. In addition, slow service, it took them 30 minutes to bring us out our food. I've tasted better, I probably won't be coming back here again.The sad thing is that every Japanese resident of Clark County would rather shop at Greenland Market than Nakata or Japan Creek.  Whenever I am at Greenland, I find every single Japanese person I know hanging out at the "Japanese food aisle". I constantly run into the cooks from Monta, the angry old man from Ichiza, a ton of various Sushi Chefs, and even the workers from I-Naba. Do these "authentic" Japanese restaurants actually get their ingredients from a Korean Market?

The produce here is awful and totally f*cking costs too much. 

The only nice workers are the Latino ones, no one else ever even gives me eye contact. 

K JUN chicken in the food court was good while it lasted but apparently they f*cking kicked them out. F*ck You Mr. Greenland or whoever the f*ck owns this place!

Chappagetti is the best jajangmeon we got here in LV but I feel it's slightly missing something on account of the fact that it's not Chinese owned. Jajangmeon is NOT Korean. It shocks me how many Koreans think it is an authentic Korean dish. Jajangmeon is a Chinese dish which became very popular in Korea. 

Anyone who knows me knows that I always bitch to my Japanese friends( most particularly Aaron K) about how Koreans tend to treat me like sh!t. I don't appreciate it at all. My Mom is Korean, so that makes me Korean, and during my youth I constantly attempted to reach out to the Korean community but was always pushed away by snotty FOB Koreans, who hated every single damn thing about me. My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese American, and no one in my family speaks any other language but English..but is that a just reason to consider me an outsider in the Korean community?  My brother took more of the Korean side of the gene pool and grew up to be 6'5". Many of you idiots don't know this but the average height in South Korea is actually around 5'10", which is considerably taller than South American and African countries. Koreans tend to be one of the taller ethnic groups in the world. Well, the workers at Greenland assume my brother is Korean on account of his massive height and they treat him pretty darn good, but I can't get any sympathy over here. I hate how at Japanese Markets they think I'm Korean, and at Korean Markets they think I'm Japanese, and at Chinese Markets they think I'm weird.

OKAY.... the best thing here at Greenland is the FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREME BREAD. Believe me, you have to f*cking try it. Pictured here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw?fsid=IOt7lW-WFEOARLbS_yG77w#Vb2-TK6mBKPndNEUkb3Y2A

They also sell those mega sized Mexican cokes for 1/4 the price you would get them at "World of Coke" for. World of Coke is officially useless now, and sucks!

I've experienced this epidemic of White dudes married to Asian women trying to shield their wives when I walk by them.  They literally grab their wives and hold them really tight when they make eye contact with me. What the f*ck is this? What the hell is going on here? I know I'm really f*cking hot, and I'm a giant womanizer, but I'm not gonna steal your damn mail order bride. Stop being so paranoid! I have white uncles and most my white friends are married to Asian women.It's funny cause in Hawaii, it's just a casual normal thing for Whites and Asians to marry..but for some reason the people here in LV think they are living some "John Lennon-Yoko Ono" fantasy and that their relationship is "forbidden" or some stupid sh!t. Go shop at Albertsons or Smiths then if you don't feel comfortable shopping around Asian people. 

Whenever I come to this Koreatown shopping center, I usually just walk straight over to "SUSHI ON RAINBOW", while my brother eats at Chappagetti. I don't know how we turned out so different. 

The Moral of the Story is to eat FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREAM BREAD with Mexican coke.

UPDATE- Today I was at Greenland Market and the workers were talking about how confused they were that  everyone was now suddenly buying Frozen Smiling Rabbit Moon Cream Bread. Apparently, they had a hard time selling it in the past.Dont come on a Sunday. You get seated very fast but the wait for your food after you order is very long. I ordered the crab cake bennidct and because the wait was so long, my eggs became hard not runny. The servers however very attentive.Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.It's like the Applebee's of BBQ.  Typical, fairly overpriced, nothing special.  Eat here if you have nowhere else to go :)After all the hype and excitement about this place I gave it a try.... not impressed.  Expensive for an average burger.  The only thing that was cool was the free peanuts but then again, not a huge fan of peanuts with hamburgers.  GO TO SMASH BURGER INSTEAD!!!The food is great, WHEN THEY GET IT RIGHT.  But I swear, they screw up our order every time.  I don't think I'll be ordering from them again...it has happened far too many times.Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!Went to Grimaldi's because of the high marks in Yelp. 

On vacation with relatives, we went in with a party of 13 including a 6-year-old, two 4-year-olds, and a 1-year-old. Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.

Asked for a kid menu - "no." Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - "no, only pizza." Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a "Hawaiian" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - "uhhh, yeah, we don't have that." WTH?

The left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a "vegetarian", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?

We ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's "extra cheese" pizza! haha

The white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, "yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing." It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.

If we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell.I went here with high expectations. Band was stellar. Well worth the cover charge even tho the hostess was trying to persuade me to sit at the bar instead of paying. Whatevs. The bad part was tho I wanted to pay for a table for dinner, they sat me at a dirty table with no place settings. Gross. Relocated myself to a dinner table and had a horrible waitress, Lakeisha -- needs to learn how to serve tables! Was rude, yelling at the hostesses, even as the food runner brought my entree, the salad/ old wine glass was never removed. Why let dirty dishes sit in front of your guest at such a nice place? Good thing the meal was one of the best ive tasted! Carolina salmon, on top of creamed corn, it was Delicious!!!! As waitress trompped around, I felt uncomfortable but tried to enjoy the ambiance. I was going to stay around at the bar to enjoy the band but the bathrooms were so far away I never went back and I am glad i didnt. It was the first time in a VERY long time I left a 10 percent tip but with such lack luster service, i think this was generous.The servers do not speak a word of English, and do not tell you the price until after you've eaten. We ended up paying over $17 for two people with just water to drink. The egg drop soup was terrible, the orange chicken was questionable, the rice and noodles were mediocre, and the skewered chicken must have been 50% fat. Frozen peas and carrots were generously thrown into everything, including the egg-drop soup... They also had zero sushi to offer. The selection was VERY limited. There are numerous superior asian buffets to this one in the area. Their only saving graces were their seafood and real ice cream, of which 6 flavors were available. So unless all you want is shrimp and ice cream, don't waste your time and money. 2/5I starting going to Benjarong about 3 years ago...it was a great Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. I had always gone to Pin Kao but since we moved we thought we try it out. My first couple experiences were good. I told ot friends and family about it. We even had it delivered to our house and ordered their carry out food. I was completely disgusted to find a medium length black hair in the bottom of our Red Curry Chicken- i fed this to my whole family! It wasnt till the second serving that my husband wanted- i found the gross hair. I called to let them know and the reaction i got was that the person on the phone didnt understand and said maybe it was mine! At the time I was a red head and my husband has short hair so nope it wasnt ours....They offered a credit for the red curry. 
A few months go by and we thought, lets give it another try. This time ill pick it up at the restaurant. The food looked good but i realized when we got home, that the white rice that comes with the entree wasnt there and there was only brown rice that i ordered for a woping $2.50 a container. I opened the rice and it smelled like a most sour foul smell ...not normal for brown rice. I took a small bite and spit it out. The rice in a bag was definitely burnt and rancid. I now had no rice to serve to my family with our entree. I went on the the chicken satay appetizer. As i opened the box of food and foil i grabbed 2 skewers and not again...i found  ANOTHER BLACK HAIR!!! I was utterly disgusted my husband was fuming mad. Also that same trip to Benjarong i made sure to tip the server an xtra 10 for a tip.
Well over $20 percent for take out. I really regretted buying this food from them again.The kicker was when i called the lady who handed me my food she said "you must have lost the white rice...i gave it to you, the brown rice is supposed to smell sour and the hair in the food...she denied it again. Im sorry but  im not going to waste $40-60 bucks on food thats rancid, has human hair cooked in it and service that is less than normal and health code appropriate. 
I will NEVER order from Benjarong ever again!!
I dont know whats the matter with who ever runs the place, why the cant keep their hair out of the food they serve others and why the heck they cant admit they mess up people food and dont exhibit clean methods of preparing food but until someone takes responsibility...i think they should be cited and given a fine to clean up their act!The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price.Went here for the first time with a gift certificate that I received for my birthday. The people at the front desk were so nice and got me green tea asi was directed to the manicure station. The girl doing my nails was nice and personable, but stopped a few times to talk to other employees in the middle of the service. I personally want my cuticles clipped and I like to see that they have taken the dry skin off. It's a pet peeve when they don't. Heads up, they don't clip the cuticle at all. After the manicure was done, while my nails looked pretty,it felt like I just had a polish change. 
Now on to the pedicure..pretty decor and comfy tufted chairs. ( in my opinion the atmosphere of this place is so much better then the service you are receiving.) no massage in chairs, no jets in the bowl, no cuticle remover put on my feet. They were soaked for maybe 30 seconds before she took maybe a few small cuticles off and trust me they needed a lot of work. Massage was great but lasted about 20 seconds per foot. And that is being generous. Paid extra for callus remover and still had dry feet when I left. When I went to check out the total was 60 dollars! Are you serious?! I will stick to my trusty nail salon any day over this over priced frou frou nail bar. Also if you want to indulge.. Go to DryBar and have a blowout next door...so much better.Really 2.5 stars overall.
I ordered delivery 6 times from Eddie's.  The pizza is good, but a couple of times it was burnt and like cardboard. Called and complained the first time to no avail. After the second burnt pizza, I just stopped ordering from them.  That was about 2 months ago. The lemon garlic chicken sub is tasty, though. They are worth a try, maybe you'll have a better experience.You'd think a place called Hot Dog Stop would serve a great Chicago-Style hot dog.

You'd also think they'd have snappy Sabrett hot dogs, since hey, they have 4 Sabrett umbrellas outside.

Leave your assumptions at the door, since neither of the above is true.  My Chicago Dog was the following:  A skinless hot dog, inside a mexican-style bolillo roll, with chopped tomato, jalapenos, sport peppers, electric green relish, mustard, onions, and a pickle spear on the side.  

C'mon guys, at least try to make it look like the real thing.  Give me a poppy seed roll, put the pickle on the dog, give me a natural casing dog, no jalapenos.  Sliced tomato please.  Sport pepper and relish were fine.  

The owner(?) was energetic, almost slightly offensive.  Tone it down slightly dude.  Customers are uncomfortable when you comment on their perceived hunger based on your judging their body size - even guys.      

The condiment bar was well stocked, but canned mushrooms?  Yuck.  

Also very expensive for what you're getting.  I paid $10 for a dog, fries and a drink.  On a positive note, their fries were really good, albeit a little too salty, but really hot and crunchy.

I hope they can get it together, and other hot dogs looked good.I was looking forward to a feast, but even with the $50 coupon, it was a big let-down. There wasn't a Greek soul IN the place--flies were buzzing everywhere, my lamb soulaki was overdone, my side dishes were exactly the same as my husband's, and he was supposed to be having a gyro platter--with none of the appropriate sides to a gyro. His meat was stone cold. Everything was very UNseasoned. The only good part was the calamari, but the dips for the calamari were more like salsa or ranch dips--I began to think I was in a Mexican joint instead of a 'Greek" place--everyone running the place was Mexican. Maybe the chain was originally started and run by Greeks, and the name says Greek, but it had no other connection, having probably sold out to Mexicans years ago....even the wine was lousy.
Next time, go to Carraba's...WAY way better food, service, ambiance, cleaniness, menu, wine.I have never met a cupcake I did not like, I have been here twice, Both times I have gotten the same 2 cupcakes, Orange Creme & Razzberry, Lemon zest. They are both very good, always moist, I usually have to take the top half of the frosting off because there is just to much of it. I really like the cupcakes but the customer service is lacking, My husband and I went in, there were 2 ladies in front of us. There were 2 workers they both ignored my husband and I and focused on flirting with the 2 girls in front of us, chatting them up for 10 minutes, when the girls left and they finally helped us out, it was "what can I get you... Need your receipt?" we didn't even get so much as a Thank you or a Have a good night. When you don't feel your patronage is appreciated you don't tend to want to visit again!Very disappointed. Cupcake was dry. Purchased on a Sunday early afternoon. Wondered later if they were Saturday's cupcakes. Guess so. Won't be going there again to spend my hard-earned money on stale cake. Sorry, Sweet Daddy.Had the three taco lunch special.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Offered chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the dish, albeit very mild, is good.  Tried an assortment of other salsas from the salsa bar.  The "taco sauce" was somewhat bland, the salsa verde was very good (and spicy) but the other salsas I tried were lacking punch.

Ordered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.

All three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.

Carne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.

Chicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.

Carnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.

There's not a huge beer selection, which is a positive, but had he standards and a good selection of mexican beers.

Hopefully they can get the spice levels set correctly and I would be more than happy to give it another shot.Pita bread was very good. 
Disappointed with the fattoush. I ordered it as a carry out. When I was ready to eat it, I opened the carton and it had dressing on it and all the pita chips soaked up dressing. Also, the tomatoes in it tasted old. I threw them out. 
Mixed shawarma was not like I'm used to. I had a couple bites and put it down. Not good in my opinion. The saffron rice was fair. 
Hummus had too much tahini and wasn't lemony at all. It tasted pasty. 

Even though I was hungry, I threw most of it out. 

I am middle eastern and hear my friends say how good it is there. I didn't think so.My experience was a little different here.  First of all the parking lot was empty, usually a bad sign.  When we entered the resturant, we were the only ones in there.  The two guys working there were friendly enough and the prices were fantastic.  But the food didn't taste quite right.  Something tasted a little off in both my dinner and my wifes.  Almost like the oil they were cooking with was too old.   And the fact that they charge for refills on the soda (after the first free refill, but it's a small cup) was a little offputting.  The price is right but the food could certainly be better.I have been there 3 times. No one have ever greeted me or even said Hi . No customer service what so ever. Clothes are designer, but old and out of date. Prices are high. Selection is slim. Needs to put forth a bit more effort in my opinion.My GLK hood would not latch properly without slamming the hood. Only one side had the latching problem. While in for service I requested an adjustment to correct the problem. I was told by my adviser that service could not do the adjustment. When I got home I adjusted the hood in just a few minutes. I should not have done that being it was under warranty. I assume they did not want to take the time to do the adjustment. This was an issue that was a while back but it is still stuck in my crawl, so I decided to mention it.Too few checkout lanes open, check. Open checkouts are absurdly slow, check. Restrooms are filthy with sticky floors, check. Receipt contains a feedback/survey link whereby customer comments are completely ignored, check. Yup, this is a pretty typical Walmart store. What? It's a TARGET you say?Once upon a time I had FIrst Union, then Wachovia bought it, then Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, so now my bank is Wells Fargo. I tend to stay loyal to a business as long as the customer service stays good but I've gotten tired of this giant bank's policies and I'm itching to go with something smaller like a local credit union. 
I started to notice ridiculously high fees for things that should not incur a fee to begin with. For instance, I get charged to put money INTO my savings account and then I get charged even more if I or they have to pull it back into my checking. They call this "overdraft protection", but it's MY money coming from MY savings account not a line of credit.  Don't banks like for a person to put money into their savings account? 
While shopping around I have found that the credit unions tend to not do this or if they do charge, they charge a nominal fee for removing money from savings usually only if you do it more than so many times in a month.  NO ONE ELSE charges you to transfer money INTO your savings like Wells Fargo does!
Bottom line is, I have no problem with the customer service at this particular branch or any Wells Fargo branch I've used,  but I think Wellls Fargo charges fees for  things they shouldn't and too much at that. I also think it's the more ethical thing to do to switch away from big banks like Wells Fargo. I'd rather keep my money local unless it benefits me financially to not keep it local, which is far from the case with Wells Fargo.  I'm switching to a credit union.Horrible horrible went with a friend his 2nd time there he had bad experience the first time but went on the first day (no waffles or sweet potato pancakes) so we went around noon place has been open for 2 weeks nice hostess got a table right away then sat there for 10 mins befits someone took our drink order still missing waffles on the menu so I went for a burger I wanted soup the waitress said it's not ready it was 1245pm 1/2hr later we got our food ehhh jus a burger not impressed saw some of the Mack bros there on the way out as we paid hostess asked how it was and I said ok actually not good 1/2hr for 2 burgers that sucked and are over priced he over heard and stared me down like he was gonna fight me lol I'll never go back there againGot there at 3:15, appointment was at 3. Yes I'm late, but yes I have a terrible 2 child. Also, started to call the place at 2:45 to tell them I'd be late and ask if they'd still take me. NOBODY answers the phone here. 

Upon arriving, there were three families in the waiting area, after a couple minutes the girl comes out to ring someone up. She greets me an I tell her "I had an appointment at 3".

She says, "we'll it's now 3:20, and you have people in front of you. I'm sorry I'm here by myself and the other photographer is taking the bus to get here. If you want to wait around we will try and squeeze you in".
This was the only day I could take care of these photos. So I decided to wait. All the while seeing families go in and HEARING THE PHONE RING NON-STOP. They definitely need a receptionist , maybe the manager is a cheap turd. But this lady was by herself until 5! Which was when I got seen. Only took about 8 photos of my little one, because my daughter was tired after that point. 

Did get a free sheet of photos , but ultimately not worth the wait.Q: If you have 3 lanes set up for drive through, each of which are designed for 2 ATMs, how many drive through ATMs do you have total? 

A: If you are the Blue Diamond location of Bank of America, the correct answer is 2.Come on Jamba J, give me a mean green juice NOT from concentrate. I am waiting for you to make it fresh!This place just keeps getting worst and worst to me. Not so much the service, but the customers. In the Summer it was great, but now every single time i go in there, it's like the customers don't know how to add as they shop. Every time, i have to wait 10mins for the cashier to ring up 80 things, and another 10 for her to take off 60items, because the customer only has $20. I'm so over having to deal with people that can't count.The thing that annoys me is that, yes there's barely a wait after you sign in, but once they bring you into an exam room, you sit there for 30 mins waiting for the doctor to come look at you for less than 2 mins. Sucha waste of time. All other urgent cares I've been to has a longer wait time in the lobby but once you were called in, the nurses and doctors attend to you right away. 

And honestly, I don't think these doctors care much. They talk so fast you can't even understand them, then they go "bye" and off to the nextStock standard shopping centre.
Nothing really about this Albertsons really stands out, they have your normal run of the mill bakery and meat department. They finally refurbished the lanes and stocked with new items but still has the average stuff.

Starbucks is kinda slow and sometimes the staff isn't even in the booth.I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over.My bf recommended this place cause he used to go here back when he was in high school, he remembered it being good. 
We came here and I got the milk tea and him the Choco slush. Unfortunately, the bf and I were fairly disappointed because both of them had an incredible powder taste.Autozone and I have a love hate relationship. Here's why. 

1: Pricing. As an example a bottle of Lucas Fuel Injector cleaner is at least $1 higher here than at their competition. 
2: Batteries. Shopping around for a battery netted me a $30 savings over what Autozone wanted to charge. 
3: Quality: Autozone's lifetime brake pads and shoes have just not held up to regular use. Pads purchased from their competition have held up and are quieter. 
4: Service: Quite frankly this location seriously sucks with attitude, slowness, and just plain sloppiness. 
5: Cleanliness. Parts Stores are not bastions of cleanliness but this one is cluttered and dirty compared to other Autozone locations here in Las Vegas. 

In short, sometimes they have what you need at a price that you can't beat. But that's rare. More often than not your best bet is to pick up the phone and call around. You can often times find parts for less elsewhere.Went on a Sunday and the fried chicken and mashed potatoes were highly recommended. I have had better frozen dinners. Dry chicken and flavorless mashed potatoes. The only good thing I had were the fried pickles. Everything else was just blahhhhhhhh.The food was good for bar food, subpar for a gastropub and not what I really expected from Todd English.  Hard to say if its overpriced or not, given the mindwarp that is Vegas, but none of the dishes were outstanding.  I've eaten at Olives (one of Todd's other concepts) and was blown away and expected a similar effort here, that just missed the mark.

The concept itself is a little confusing, gastropub crossed with frat house sounds like it would be right up my alley.  But upon further reflection, I like to keep my meals and beer pong/"7 second beer chug and its free" competitions seperate.  

Not a bad place for a quick and easy meal, but didn't live up to the Todd English expectations that I had.Nothing special and not worth the long drive all the way out there. Myself and another guest had the fish 'n' chips, which tasted like a frozen, breaded piece of fish from a store-bought Highliner box of fish. It certainly was not fresh.

The side of onion rings was huge, but those too seemed as if they were frozen and store-bought, and many of them were burnt and cooked in old fryer oil.

Fries tasted frozen and/or pre-cooked.

The atmosphere was nice and what you'd expect.

It took 3 servers before one would finally take an order, because the first two would say "sure I'll take your order" then "oh! Just a second..." and wander off to another table.

In sum: stay in the city and you'll find better food with a better price and better service.A Storage Locker is just a storage locker.  The only thing that really makes one better than the next is price and customer service.  I made the mistake of not shopping around and when I discovered that Public Storage on Camelback is significantly more than its competitors, I still wasn't motivated to relocate to more reasonable storage until the office staff became increasingly rude.  Paying more is irritating but there was no way I was going to continue to support staff who have no sense of customer satisfaction and basic courtesy.  Clearly they don't realize that the bottom line is that it is the cusomter that pay their salary.  Never again, good riddanceThe good things about this place are the location and the fact the food is decent. This restaurant is located in the Fashion Mall, right in the happening part of the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn. The enchiladas that I got were also pretty good.

The only bad things about this place are that it's pricey, and in my opinion you don't really get enough for what you're paying. I understand that the fact that it is on the strip would make it more expensive, but they could at least provide some free chips and salsa. Most other Mexican restaurants do!Vig Uptown

Too many lawyers and 60+ Cougars.
At least the cougars at Vig Arcadia are hot and 30-40.
What can you expect on this side of town though....?This was my second visit to the Vig. The first visit was not a good one, but my arm was twisted, and I agreed to go again. Yeah, still don't like it. The first time I had some ribs, and I had to question what animal the ribs were from! A hamster maybe? It was disturbing. Glad I didn't see them on the menu this time around, The food is overpriced, and average. The chicken kabobs were dry, and when the waitress asked how everything was, I told her, and she agreed. She said she didn't like them either! Nice. My friend ordered her burger medium, and it came out well done. Very well done. I was brought the wrong beer, but said I would drink it anyway. I don't like to waste beer. When the waitress brought me the correct beer, she said I wouldn't be charged for the first one. I was. 

I really don't get all the good reviews. Most of the people I saw weren't even eating.... because they were to busy posing, trying to get the attention of all the other posers! I thought I was in Scottsdale for a minute. Ugh.Ok food- overpriced. Cool  atmosphere.My daughter and I decided to have breakfast out this morning. Big Mistake.
We went to IHop because she loves pancakes and waffles. The restaurant was busy but we were still seated right away.  
Our Server Kate came over promptly to get our drink orders. When she brought our drinks she got our food orders after that it kind of went downhill.
It took 20minutes to get our food (pancakes with face and brioche french toast) shortly after we got our food and after we had ordered a 2nd chocolate milk my daughter tells me she has to use the restroom. (Daughter is 7 ) . When we return from the restroom our table has been bussed and there is someone else sitting there. We were not in the restroom that long. her pancake had not been eaten and I had only finished one piece of my french toast, als0 her 2nd chocolate milk had not been drank.
I went  over to the hostess stand to say something and they were less than helpful.
They did say sorry. I said that the check was still on the table as well as uneaten food
then they handed me  my check. 
I was about to pay the whole tab and I was getting angrier for the lack of reaction from the Manager I told the manager that I did not think I should pay for my daughters
pancakes since she did not get a chance to eat them.
She removed them from the bill and her note on the check was "did not eat".
I'm not sure what I expected but I will not be back.I'm so disappointed in the direction this place has taken... 

When it first opened, it was AMAZING!  Everything we tried was outstanding, the prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly.  I recommended it to everyone and thought I had finally found "my" Thai place.  

...and then they went under new management.  It was all downhill from there.  The service became worse, but what really became bad was the food.  The portion sizes decreased.  The panang curry, which used to be creamy and delicious is now watered-down and over-spiced.  The pad Thai is bland.  The Nam Sod, which used to be my favorite dish, is now watery and doesn't taste fresh as it used to.  They became really inconsistent with their spicing, too.  We used to be able to order hot and know what to expect.  Now if you order hot, you'll either get hardly spiced at all, or so dang hot that you can't eat more than 3 bites.  And we prefer our food spicier than most, so that's saying something.   

This just makes me sad.  I wish the original owners were still there, or at least had given the new management some training before bowing out . I thought I had found "the one" but now I continue my search.What a disappointment.  I had read some good reviews and was looking forward to trying something new.  I love the concept.  Cool nostalgia, and interesting books to look at. However, everything else was not up to par.  We had brought our young child in and were already late getting her some dinner and to bed.  Unfortunately, it took way too long to get our food and get out, even though there were only 4 tables.  The waitress was super sweet, but the other waitress was sitting outside socializing.  Our waitress seemed to have trouble handling the 4 tables.  We waited excessively long for all of the food to arrive, and the order was incorrect.  On top of this, the restroom was untidy and most of all, the food wasn't that great.  I had high hopes for this place, but I've got to give it a thumbs down, we won't be back.After reading the reviews, I should have known better than to expect good ramen but I was still hopeful.  Sadly, I was disappointed.

I ordered the tonkotsu pork belly with an egg traditional style, as well as edamame and gyozas to share.  The appetizers were cooked well and the best part of the meal.  When the huge bowls were ready, I realized that they gave me the modern version of ramen instead of what I ordered.  The sulky girl behind the counter who took my order originally was not what I wanted to deal with again so I went with it.  There was no depth to the broth and the noodles were not ramen noodles as they were soft and kind of slimy.  The store bought packaged kind is better.  Where was the milky broth made rich and unctuous by hours upon hours of slowly simmered pork bones?  This was a poor introduction to ramen for my friend who never had it before.

I couldn't even eat half of it because it was not good and bland.  When we went to get to go containers since I hate to waste food, the same unhelpful girl asked why we needed two...really?Meh. The food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive, but it was also boring. 

I'll never understand how so many Mexican restaurants can make refried beans bland.

I've had much worse, but I've also had much better. It was worth a shot, but I probably won't be back.I love harkins! i have gone to many and only return to this one because it is close to me. Yes the theater might always be nice and clean and not ridiculously crowed but the management is ridiculous. Some crazy girls in front of me and a friend of mine had something up there you know where and kept trying to get us kicked out for literally doing nothing. We may have whispered hear and there but nothing that would disturb the whole movie. The manager need a reason to kick us out so claimed we harassed two girls in the bathroom (like seriously the most ridiculous thing ever) and when i asked him to please review the security footage to see that me and my friend never even went to the bathroom together he declined and asked us to leave. Luckily the assistant manager is the sweetest lady ever and could tell we didn't do anything so she asked the crazy manager is she could handle it and then she brought us to a different room. however this took my mom coming to the theater and screaming at the manager...haven't seen the man there since and hopefully never will again.

additional info: this was the twilight marathon attached to the breaking dawn part 2 premiere. the guy i speak of was around 5'5 and completely bald. If you ever see him run in the opposite direction. evil man.The food is bland and service is suspect (slow)... clientele is senior citizens which I personally don't mind... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste. I have been there twice now, and was underwhelmed both times. Probably wont go back, but if your 55+ you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies....The first time we tried to get this deal was at Rio. Yet, stand in wrong line, automated machine selling regular price rather than this deal, terrible, terrible service there, it was late and unable to change line to purchase this deal. The food was awful there, really awful!!! Absolutely do not go for Rio, perhaps trying Rio seafood better, but additional $15, worth it? Casears palace was limited in choice. Harrah's was decent. Paris, Paris was okd too. One best thing about 24 hrs buffet pass, you don't have to OD on food , stuffs yourself, but spread over period of time and if you dont have to stand in line for these buffets than probably worth it. It was nothing spectacular, just average buffets for the price...Sometime it's better to pay for quality than quantity, good for breakfasts only.I had a groupon for a spa mani/pedi.  The technician was very nice but the services received were NOT impressive and weren't as advertised.  I'm not sure how I receive a  "spa" manicure with a simple filing of my nails.  I can't even imagine spending full price...Wandering around the Strip on a chilly Christmas Eve, I was EXTREMELY hungry and suffering from intense sugar withdrawal. We had just emerged from the arcade in New York New York (not worth it; it will eat all your coins and leave you poor and desolate) when I saw It'Sugar!

I've always had a childhood fondness for old-fashioned candy-stores (i.e any store dedicated to candy), probably stemming from my early love of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So, of course, I was hooked.

Looking back, the candy was insanely overpriced. I mean, yes, it IS Vegas but.. really? There's no way a handful of gummies should add up to $5. What is this nonsense |:I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews about the service. Really sub standard. Our server was actually very cocky. Really close to annoying and rude.

The Food. 

Pierogis - OK had some caviar on it. 

Flatbread pizza (with Truffle Oil) - decent -thin crust -had a great crust

Scallops - It was borderline BAD!! 

Chicken wings (Thai curry) - The best dish of the night - chicken wings lollipop style covered in curry Thai sauce. Very flavorful

Tuna Tartare-OK 

Chocolate Ravioli - Horrible 

Toffe cake with ice cream - Recommended to us  - i did not think it was that good. 

We did have a great bottle of Pinot  Noir. !!!

Hookah- OK 

Close to three stars but the service was just not up to PAR. 

I doubt if I would be back..This is perhaps a variation of Tex-Mex, but not really Mexican.  Tacos with flour tortillas only?  Or did I miss the corn variant?  And why was the pulled pork stew (carnitas) so very sweet?  No fresh cilantro on the tacos?
Sorry that I don't share the enthusiasm here -- but this is the type of Mexican food they serve for gringos in the US.  And even for this clientele Los Cardos would be sub-par.This aquarium is ok.  I've definitely been to bigger and better ones.  The fact that it's attached to a mall is interesting, but ultimately a big pain in the butt because you not only have to navigate aquarium traffic, but also mall traffic.  On top of that, AZ Mills is a mess.

Sea Life feels like what it is: a privately-owned aquarium franchise that uses mall space.

I probably wouldn't have gone if I didn't have the 2-for-$20 groupon, since the admission is pricey.  The aquarium itself is small and crowded.  There are also "box" seats seemingly randomly strewn throughout, with which my shins are very well acquainted.

They do have a nice sting ray exhibit, with some sharks here & there.  The 360 degree walk-through was nice, but small.  The jellyfish exhibit was a very small tank.  The crustacean room was interesting.  The seahorse exhibit was great (then again, I love seahorses so I'm pretty forgiving).

It felt like I could have seen the majority of these fish in the Rainforest Cafe in the same mall, or even at a tropical fish store.

There are a lot of kids working there.  This isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't make me feel confident in their marine biology experience.  

I left feeling underwhelmed and a bit annoyed.  Unless I get free tickets, I probably won't be going back.If you like to awkwardly stand around and maybe sway to the music, then Surrender is your place to be. 

Also, if you like to be molested by strangers and have sweaty strangers pressed up against you, then Surrender is still your place to be. 

How is this possible? Because Surrender is the land of opposites with nothing in between. On one hand, we have the space by the pool, occupied sparsely on a Saturday night by bottle-service people on beds and random people walking around and talking but no one dancing or apparently enjoying themselves. On the other hand, we have the area around the bar and the "indoor" part where people are packed like sardines trying to dance. I just wanted to dance and Surrender really wasn't conducive to this at all. 

The line looked ridiculous as well and if I had to wait in that line, I'd probably be even more upset. The bar staff was reallllly slow and getting a drink was so arduous I thought about stocking up when I was actually able to order one. Music got sorta repetitive over time. Overall, I'm underwhelmed.In my Vegas experiences, Surrender has been the place where you expect to have a chill good time. Don't get me wrong, you spend as much here on drinks like you would any other club in Vegas. This place is huge but knowing there is XS right next door, it doesn't satisfy the young's craving for a wild night out in the 702. You can have fun at Surrender but I feel like I would rather spend the night at the neighboring Encore club XS. 

Drinks are the same price at XS. Your bottle service looks better at XS. Just go to the club next door, Surrender is Encore Beach Club during the day and it's your best bet to shell your skrills during the day. Skip the night party at Surrender.Surrender's look is similar to XS with an inside/outside club. The vibe at Surrender is standard issue high end Vegas club scene.

DRESSCODE:
Most people were dressed to impress, but there were the few in flip-flops or Converse...so not sure if they're strict on this or not.

MUSIC:
house and hip hop mixed in with house beats. The music was ok, just your basic top 40. 

Drinks are pricey though.. running about $20 for an AMF with tips. And I saw someone paid $8 for a mini Fiji water..Say whaaatt?? Lots of bouncers strolling around keeping the place in check. They don't let you sit down unless you have have bottle service, but I find that silly when there are so many empty tables.A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed.  Pricey too.  My chopped liver (I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.

i was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's.I have been looking forward to the opening of Primebar since I saw the signage.  I went with a group of friends Fri, June 4 figuring that they would have had enough time to work the kinks out.  Considering the place is owned by a successful restaurant group, Restaurant-America, I assumed the place would be running on all cylinders by then.  Not so much.  
I was actually shocked by the lack of organization and lack of management presence.  Normally at a place this new, SOMEBODY stops by your table to see what you think.  
The dining room was about 75% full but the service was super slow.  Drinks took forever.  In fact one of our drinks (a draught beer mind you) was delivered after our dinners were cleared.  The drink had been ordered when dinner was ordered.  
Three of the items we ordered had issues (mostly missing ingredients).  I understand some mistakes for the first few weeks but what I didn't understand is how the place handled it or didn't handle it as the case may be.  
Our server was made aware of the issues.  And NOBODY ever came to the table to address the situation.  I didn't expect for anything to be taken off the bill but a manager could have come and said something, anything.  
In one instance, a member of our party ordered a margarita which stated "agave nectar" on the menu.  It came to the table clearly missing this ingredient.  When the orderer of the drink asked if it could be a little sweeter (aka more agave nectar), the waitress actually came back with it and said, "The bartender says he made it exactly how he is supposed to and you must just not like it"  Seriously? 
I plan to give it another try in six months or so but I must say, if someone from the management team had just come to the table and said two words to us it probably would have made all the difference.Over-priced and under-cared for, the Sport Center is a memorial to what could have been if Vegas residents used this place or if the owners took care of it.  The building houses a Cross-Fit gym, batting cages, climbing wall and basketball court.  The basketball court is in great condition and is used for basketball camps.  The climbing wall is decent, but there's no marked climbs and the cost is pretty ridiculous ($8 a climb v. $10 a day in another climbing gym).  

I went for the batting cages which have a great set up with a mock field and mock home run background.  However, the machines are old and not maintained well (4 out of every 14 pitches are low or deeply inside).  The batting cage cost is a little high too ($2 for 14 pitches).  This place could be amazing with the fake field and wall, but the poorly maintained machines and bad pitching ruin the place.

All in all, this place is a monument to what could be an amazing local sports place/community center.  Instead, it's just a rundown place with moments of genius.So disappointed, second time I've been here and the service was horrible. We sat for 10 minutes before anyone even came by. The table was so wobbly our water spilled and when we asked to move, our waiter acted like it was such a problem, seriously the place was not even a fourth full. The chocolate pizza was like rubber, when we told the waiter he said what do you want? I told them we were locals and we had been there before and this was the most disappointing outing I had there. Sorry Sugar Factory but I'll be referring my guest to other restaurants on the strip.After seeing all the pictures, I really wanted to come to Sugar Factory and I wanted to enjoy it....but I didn't. 

Coming in for breakfast, I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the Hollandaise sauce was just too overwhelming. It had too much of a buttery cheesy taste that by the time I finished my food (I don't like to waste...and I'm a fatty) I began to feel a little bit sick. They also drench the plate in the sauce instead of an appropriate amount so it is hard to try and take bites with minimal sauce.The eggs were cooked well although I find it difficult to really screw up eggs. 

My gf ordered the classic crepe with berries. This was very underwhelming for me. Having gone to Cafe Crepe, the one here was just not up to snuff. Wish I had a few more berries and a little more love put into making it for the price I pay. 

Though I will say that the menu has MANY items on it and I'm sure if I had ordered maybe the fondue or a dinner item I would have enjoyed it more. Just as a breakfast place I would pass.Sugar Factory is OK.  Sort of a hit or miss for me.

I've had the chicken and waffles and the french dip sandwich.  The sandwich was easily below average, no flavor at all.  The chicken was actually pretty good, the crust was sweet - definitely the highlight of the meal for me.  Waffles were decent, nothing to write home about.  The fries were pretty good, above average.

The specialty drinks are overpriced.  

They use celebrities to market their restaurant = LAME.  If "The Situation" was sitting near me at the restaurant, I would throw my waffles at him.

Food isn't incredibly overpriced, but not cheap either.  I will resist returning for a third time.  

SUMMARY:  Honestly, this restaurant is for your reality-tv-loving girls aged 14 - 23.  A no-go for food.  Better for desert.After having five wonderful experiences with Sugar Factory in Las Vegas, I have to write a negative review. The new chef and existing owners have decided to chop the menu, removing many favorite items, and to stop serving many of the popular breakfast items at 11am. For a Vegas restaurant, this doesn't make much sense. It is clear that the menu is focused on flavor as the existing items are still wonderful, but the changes are not welcome, in my opinion. I found that the owners are changing the name, soon, so perhaps the store isn't working anymore. Sad.It was good for the price. The service can be a hit or miss. I have been there when we were never offered any chips or dessert. The burrito is massive hard to finish for one person. I have had much better in LA and San Francisco. If i was in the area and wanted something cheap i would try it again.I have given Lee's many chances, and far too many disappointments have come my way. I think that I have particularly high standards for them because they are soo much better in California. Their sandwiches are usually sloppy with a lack of/ skimp amount of necessary ingredients such as pate and picked daikon and carrots. Their bobas are inconsistent and not always as soft and plump as they should be, but rather shribbled with a hard center and dripping with boba water residue in my slushes and teas. The slushes are watered down and flavorless. I have taken my out of town friends here to try, and was embarrassed in doing so. I should've known when I tried to order in Vietnamese, not one person understood me because there were no vietnamese workers there. This really doesn't matter to me, but I can certainly see why the sandwiches are not up to par with my cravings for authenticity. I'd rather go to hue thai for the best sandwiches.This place is tiny. It has basically 3 different types of ramen and you pick and choose your toppings. It is very unique for Vegas and it is what  typical ramen house is. I guess since I am not crazy for ramen, I just thought it was OHKAY. I had the miso ramen with kimchee and corn, because when it comes out it comes out bland. They give you 2 tiny pieces of pork, and it looks very fatty. The ramen noodles were good and seemed fresh. The soup is hearty. The noodles in the tonkatsu ramen are thin and look different.This is probably the most popular ramen restaurant near Las Vegas area because we had to wait about 1 hour just to get in. Restaurant was pretty small and service was okay.  

Miso ramen with extra chashu porks and nitamago ($7.25 + $2.5 + $1.5) - The miso broth was a bit salty, but at least there was some flavor. Nitamago (flavored egg) was actually pretty good. Chashu porks had a good texture, but tasted a bit salty. I do like their wavy noodle, pretty chewy. 

This place probably won't be this popular if it opens up around the Los Angeles area because there are too many great ramen restaurants. Overall - noodle wasn't too bad, but broth was definitely a bit salty.HOT! Not sure if their air conditioner is normally off, but it was 94 degrees inside! Hot room with hot ramen is not a good combination. 

The noodles my husband got were salty. Mine were...ehh. I could have done better with a cheap pack of noodles at home and a few eggs.

For $42, not worth it- just for NOODLES!We took a spontaneous trip to Vegas this past Easter weekend and after seeing the beautiful pictures of Rumor (and after finding out it was about $80/night for the champagne special), we decided to book a couple of nights there. We've never stayed off the strip before, so we thought this would be a good time to try something new. Besides, we've stayed at boutique hotels in other cities and have always loved them!

Well, or so we thought... Rumor is beautiful. The decor and furniture alone are worth the 5 stars, but that's about where it ends..

Our room was at the very corner of the resort and wasn't the room we had requested. They told us they were fully booked and to check in the next day to see if more would be available. However, from the time we checked in to the time we checked out, we barely saw any guests there.

Numerous things about our room wasn't working either. The phone, for starters, was missing the plug to actually BE plugged in. The iron and the outlet in the bathroom weren't working either. Little things, but they really started to get annoying after a while. The hotel also does not have a fridge or coffee maker, which is kind of a bummer.

So, skip this hotel and find something better on the strip.This review is on the bánh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). I ordered the pork sandwich. It was just average. Nothing great but nothing bad either. I haven't had one yet as good as in Vietnam but I'm looking. If I return, I wouldn't get the sandwich next time.What an amazing world we live in. We can cure diseases, put men in space, and pack literally thousands of songs onto one little MP3 player - but we can't make a better DMV.

I came in here a few months ago because I had to have a duplicate license made, since mine had gone missing. I thought this was going to be a quick procedure with no major flaws.

But once I got up to the counter, the woman who was waiting on me (a middle-aged red-haired woman) was extremely pretentious and rude, and contradicted information explicitly stated on the DMV web site. The site said you needed a state-issue picture ID and one of another form of ID. I had a Social Security card, which was one of said forms of ID. I brought EVERYTHING the web site had asked me to. And she said it wasn't good enough.

She started bitching at me, even though I explained that this was exactly what the website said. The customer is always right, you pretentious jerk. Apparently you didn't learn that when you went through customer service training - if you went through it at all. Eventually I was able to find sufficient ID in my wallet, but this woman was extremely rude all the while. If you're working at the DMV, you damn well better know what the website says, and uphold it. Just because you chose to work in a job with rude customers doesn't give you the right to be rude to me.

The facility itself is actually very nice and quite large, however even so it STILL manages to get overcrowded, and wait times for things like this are unbearable. I thought getting my duplicate license made would be a pretty painless procedure, and I'd be out of there in an hour, hour-and-a-half tops. It took OVER THREE HOURS. 

The parking is terrible, it is clear whoever invented this facility didn't know that LOTS of people go to a DMV. It isn't uncommon, as a result, to have cars illegally parked on the street. Furthermore, other neighboring shopping centers have begun putting up "parking for customers only" signs, so that is looking to be less of an option. It looks like construction has begun on another parking lot, but we'll see what happens.

Another annoyance is that you no longer get your renewed/duplicate license/permit during your visit - they have to mail it to you now. I liked being able to leave with my license in my pocket. Why change something that wasn't broken in the first place? 

This place either needs to be expanded or another DMV needs to be built in Henderson. And the bitchy woman that waited on me needs to be fired. Enough said.I've been here a few times and each time it's really a hit or miss. Sometimes my nails come out amazing and other times they come out horrid, and those times they come out bad, no one wants to fix it. They have a HUGE gel color selection and a bunch of different designs to pick from, so I'll give them that. 
The downside is that this place is always packed. If you're going to walk in without an appointment, good luck. The people at the front desk are rude. I get that you're busy, but COME ON! Some customer service won't kill you. Prices are average, but can get pretty pricey depending on what you get. Lastly, you WILL feel rushed. They just want to get you in and on to the next. I have gotten 3D designs here almost every time, and each time the nail tech always tries to talk me out of what I want. They only want to do one finger and always try to get away doing a half ass job and when I tell them that's not what I wanted, they roll their eyes and mumble something to their neighbor.Maybe it's my age or the fact that our group was seated next to a group of people that looked like they stepped out of the TV show Amish Mafia that had BO so bad that we asked to be moved, but this show was terrible! A times I found the performances so awkward I wanted to cover my face. 

The Marilyn Monroe impersonator also doubled as Shania Twain, which I found hilarious after I finally realized (kudos to her for tricking us). The Tina Turner and Michael Jackson acts really did bring it home though, they kicked butt! The Elvis impersonator was so awful, he was shimmying, thrusting around, I wasn't sure if it was part of the act or if he was seizing.

Like I said at the beginning, it may be my age because the oldsters in the crowd really enjoyed themselves, just ate it up! So my recommendation is, if you aren't a current member of AARP, don't bother.The tram project in Edinburgh! Most people think they will be a good idea, however almost everybody cannot stand the annoyance and delays surrounding the works. 

The tram line is supposed to go from the airport to Leith. However, after only a couple of years, work is slow and progress is at a snail's pace. Last year Princes Street changed remarkably due to the noisy works blocking off cars and buses from the street. Indeed, the west end of the city seems to be undergoing constant works every time you pass it. 

I'm sure the trams will be brilliant when they are finished, and Edinburgh will have caught up with other European cities. However one does feel that the money could have been used to improve the already great bus service. I'm sure when they are finished, we will all like the tram system but that I am sure is a long way away.Disappointing , because of the other high reviews I wanted to give this place a try. chicken strips were teeny tiny , the baked chicken strips were flavorful but the fried had a really weird flavor, friendly service and cool drink machine. Wouldn't recommendPros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.Food wasn't bad... I've been in there three times now.  Love having a good breakfast place on Mill.  So why only 2 stars?  SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.  The last two times I went, it was incredible how long everything took.  And while it wasn't insanely busy, the staff were literally running around... sometimes carrying full plates!?  Waited about 20 minutes after sitting down to get that "Has anybody helped you yet?", and then it took well over an hour to get any food.  If they would just tell you at the front counter that the wait was over an hour, I'd be fine with that.  Pretty much exact same experience 2 times in a row, but like I said I'm a sucker for a breakfast joint.  Maybe 3rd time is the charm?This place was okay. So forgettable that I'll make this very short.

Bad service, understaffed, etc.
Sushi was just okay. Ingredients were lacking.
Expensive for what it is.

Yeah, forgettable.I am sorry but this place gives you way too much food and I don't like the vibe of the restaurant. The employee didn't speak English and didn't know what to say to me. I tried my best to make him understand but I totally got the wrong food. I did not care but he was annoyed I wasn't eating it. He gave me a dirty look and I was very annoyed as well. I don't think I will be going back......Oh, I wanted to love this place! I really did. Phoenix NEEDS cupcakes, desserts, pastries, etc! I was very underwhelmed. 

The Key Lime cupcake was the best of the lot. I'm a sucker for key lime, but that's this cupcake's saving grace. The flavor was very subtle, and this is a trend with all the cupcakes. 

The Lemon cupcake was very much lacking in flavor. Even more subtle than the Key Lime. 

One good thing are the cakes themselves; at least they're moist. And the ratio of frosting to cake is spot on. However the flavors are not quite what I was expected, especially given how much each cupcake cost. 

I'll probably try this place again sometime next year, if they're still in business. Maybe there will be a tastier batch of cupcakes! As for now I'm going to pass. 

On a side note, the ladies behind the counter were in fact very kind and personable.While I can't review actual work, I can review my initial impression from a first visit.  He responded quickly, but Artie dismissed my plumbing issue and recommended I get a shower curtain that suctions to the tub (at least the visit was free, so I didn't have to pay for that awesome advice).  

I'm not just a dumb girl and I had considered that was the problem, but I had called him based on Yelp reviews after I realized it was a much bigger issue and simply felt like he didn't listen to my concerns - unfortunately for him because it indeed WAS a big issue and he missed out!  It took three plumbers until I found someone with enough knowledge and motivation to find and fix my issues.  I recommend DrainPro!Old school fun... good bar staff...cheap drinks...fun!  As for the Tommy Wind show...horrendous...so bad and so bad I couldnt even laugh but rather I was sad for him.  Dont go to see it, it will only encourage bad magic!Okay, so I had mentioned in my 1st review of this place that we would give it a 2nd chance... We still giving them just 2 stars. We went on a Fri night...pretty busy. Decided to eat outside on their patio which was pretty full of people...They we short-staffed on this night. The waiter was nice but always in a hurry to run off & even ignored us a few times when we tried to get his attention. We both ordered red wine....The glass was only about 1/3 full & paid like $8 a glass! ...I can get a 1.5 liter of wine at thestore for this price. We got a greek salad & a margeurita pizza...Pretty good, but nothing extraordinary...Oregano's has them beat by far! We will most likely not come again to BRICK....Oregano's Rocks!I'd been scoping out this truck at food events for quite some time and was excited to finally give it a try last night at Streats. It is such an ingenious idea to turn an old fire truck into a pizza making machine! I especially love when they make it "breathe fire." Unfortunately, I realized why there are rarely any lines at this truck, the pizza was a huge let down. I had a slice of the pepperoni and sausage since it was what they had available at the moment. The pizza was dripping grease, which isn't always a bad sign, so I folded it in half and took a bite. I didn't taste a thing, not the sauce or the pepperoni or the sausage. This can't be I thought, so I took another bite, willing my taste-buds to try harder. Nothing but a greasy, bland mess. As I kept trying bite after bite it became apparent that the pizza is pretty much flavorless. At $4 a slice, I expected that they would be buying quality ingredients, but it was obvious that they were not. Maybe they are buying gas for the truck?I ordered a Asada Quesadilla. I got a very small quesadilla. No salsa available. Was not fresh and who knows what kind of meat that was. I don't know, but it tasted awful and certainly wasn't steak. I don't know what qualifies them to be a Mexican restaurant, but I was not impressed. Your best tip will be to skip this place.not a fan.  the food was meh, the service was horrible.  went there for lunch today with a small group, ordered an appetizer for all to share and each ordered an individual dish.  i also ordered an ice tea - they were out.  i believe this has to be a first for a thai place.  

one of our dishes came out about 15 minutes of waiting, still no appetizer.  finally after about  30-40 minutes the appetizer came out followed by the other two dishes spaced out about 5 minutes apart.  ???  lunch took  about 1 1/2 hours and the taste wasn't worth the time it would take at panda.  f this place.  don't go.actually 2.5 stars, and that is to say, nothing memorable.  I  read tons of reviews on this place and wanted to love it.  Unfortunately from food to service, it just didn't deliver.  Save the spring vegetable spaetzle, nothing was good.  Here's what we had...

the acclaimed cheddar bacon biscuits - positively overcooked.  The outsides weren't just crunchy; they were rock hard.  The insides were dry and flavorless.

the zucchini pancakes - tasty but undercooked and greasy.

b burger - though ordered well done, it came medium.  I know some foodies think well-done is gauche, but that's what my mom wants, that's what she orders so just deal with it and bring her what she wants.  And don't act all pissy about it when she sends it back.  

vegetable chopped salad - such promise on the menu that fails to impress on the plate.  As other reviewers have said, it's an amateur salad and utterly lacking flavor or originality.  

grilled salmon with panzanella - salmon was well-cooked but nothing special.  The panzanella salad was an interesting twist that just didn't work for anyone at the table - cornbread croutons that failed to absorb any flavors.  frankly the panzanella flavors just didn't mesh.  you were eating croutons, cucumbers, tomato, and some dressing.    

my glass of Pickett Fence pinot noir tasted like the bottle had been sitting open for a couple days.  

my other comments about the food are get over the bacon in everything and use the raw corn sparingly.  Sometimes it just doesn't work and frankly gets boring when one or the other is in so many dishes on the menu.

Lastly service was poor.  The aforementioned b burger was sent back to be refired.  Should that take 20 minutes?  Certainly not when the restaurant is just gearing up for the peak hours... Beyond that, our server was unattentive and mistakenly laboring under the idea that he was charming.  This is a nitpick, but if I hand you my credit card with the bill, you should probably hand it back to me when you're done not to my Dad.  Pay attention just a bit.  

With so many new, fun places to try in Phoenix these days, we won't be back.  Blah, trying to hard to be hip, and just not that good.  Doesn't hold a candle to FnB.The dessert was wonderful - some rhubarb thing with ice-cream.  The food :-|On paper Wurstle Gourmet Sausages is an interesting hot dog/sausage concept, but as a business this so called "evolution of a hot dog" is poorly executed.  The idea is not that novel either, as there are other versions that exactly mirrors the offering here (Puka Dog as mentioned by a few other reviewers) or have sausage/hot dog baked into freshly made bread dough (the kind you may see in many Taiwanese bakeries).

The location is good, very convenient for the shoppers, especially if the younglings are in toll, when hunger strikes.  Which was the main reason I decided to give them a try.  Uhh no, I don't have kids or was babysitting one at the time.  Anyway... Getting back on track, the menu with pictures to help customers make their ordering decision is effective.  If you see what you like you can order it, even if you can't read or speak English.  I totally appreciate picture menus.  Just point and like magic, you get what you pointed at, usually.

So what they offer are a selection of 6 sausages (not counting their Breakfast Minis, and 2 kid sizes and flavors for a lower price), on choice of 3 bread options, and 4 "toppings" that are crammed down the hole made in the bread.  Price tag is $5.69 pre-tax.  Besides their main attractions, they also have desserts (Nutella filled Puffs and Mini Cupcakes), fries and chips, and some beverages.  If you are vegetarian, they have a vegetarian option too (asparagus, onions, spicy ketchup, relish & mayo mustard).

The sausages alone is decent, at least the flavors that I tried.  But I would not call it gourmet by any means.  The so called toppings are very pedestrian as well.  Even Costco Food Courts offer these same flavor enhancers at their self serve stations.  About the only gourmet anything is what comes with the Vegetarian Dog, if you considered spicy ketchup and mayo mustard gourmet.  The breads are generic like the options at Quiznos, without the toasting on their conveyer belt system.

For what they are charging, I don't really think it is going to score high marks on anybody's value to price ratio. Without any more interesting and unique sauces in the condiments arsenal, the urge to return and try something else you have yet to try is very low.  Since this is not Disneyland and considering that there are many better options and superior values at other venues within walking distance, you can pretty much figure out why there are no long lines here.

On the bright side, the only employee that was working at the time when I went was very courteous and friendly, and did her best to hold down the fort singlehandedly.

Review #8 of 2014Man, I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now, and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.

Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from "BACK HOME." Plus, this place is way too expensive for an "Order at the Counter" burger joint.

Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers, 1 REG order of fries to split, NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will), that it took over 15 minutes to get my order, when this place was nearly empty!!!

The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled, not even in strips, but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings, but so what. After all, it's not called "5 Guys Toppings," is it.

And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland, greasy mess. Yuck.

Maybe, if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys, I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!We went to Laziza after work for happy hour and it was disappointing, we ordered most of the appetizers, some drinks and a hookah. Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. 

For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again.Not impressed. Had the chicken satay after 2 recommendations from the servers...it was bland and tasted mostly like peanut butter. The portion was small, and I finished it in a few minutes. I didn't think it was worth it, and it was a free meal. I couldn't imagine paying the full price of $22 and being happy!Grab & go? Paid for then stood around ten minutes waiting for a dark brown, crunchy crusted pie that was about 30 seconds from being burned. Good quantity of ingredients though. I'll probably give them another shot.I'd had much better.  My dover sole tasted like a buttered heart attack on the plate.  I could feel all the butter slowly creep down my innards as the night went by.  Don't order the dover sole - it's horrible...

Sitting outside and hearing the waterfall is a nice experience.  It's very romantic and they have a light show when it gets dark every hour?  But show gets boring after a few minutes.

There are better restaurants to eat at inside Encore/Wynn such as Sinatra's.My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.

We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a "patio" sorta), we chose to eat inside. 

It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a "c"...)

Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO. 

Last time I believe a New Times food review. Come here for some eye rolls and bland food. 

PS-Perhaps the owners should establish a "complaint section" away from customer's ears as it's not super impressive to complain about diners-especially when they can see/hear you.I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their "Gold Standard" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point. 

In general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. 

Overall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.This was the new place to try in South Point, last time we were there we didn't have time to try it. This time we made sure we tried their food. We ordered a butterfinger shake in their take out line. The shake didn't taste like it was made of ice cream. It tasted like water based soft serve. Nothing like the butterfinger shakes at Sonic's, which are creamy. It had plenty of butterfinger chunks and the whipped cream was tasty. 

After we returned to our room we realized we wanted to try their food too. We were a large group of 12 and the line at Steak 'n Shake was very long. We choose to order take out and eat it in our rooms. Many ordered the burgers, I had chili cheese fries. The fries are shoe string cut which are not ideal for chili fries. The chili was bland, you didn't taste the spices most chili's have. the cheese was nacho cheese and it easily over powered everything. It felt like i was having just cheese. 

I would like to try their burgers next time, it is usually busy so I enjoyed the had the take out option.Free mac and cheese if you check in! but it's not that good..
the burgers were alright. nothing special, esp not for that price. 
garlic and parmesan fries are literally just fries with garlic and parmasan flakes on top. in and out's fries are better.. and it's about 10x cheaper. 
service was good though, so i guess that's a plus.Food is just ok. Place is nice but the quality of food is no where near Kabuki which is very similar in style and price range.
Don't even try the seaweed or squid salad, they came from Costco, and you can get 20 times more for the same price (you can fine the exact ones in the salad section in San Tan Costco).  With this you can pretty much the originality and quality of other foods. 
Guess there is no other choice around the area and people would just go there, but if you truly love sushi there are a lot better place with better price just a few miles away.I thought most all the food was awful. Definitely not worth the money. Much of it tasted over salted or just not fresh...like it was sitting out too long. Would definitely not go back.China Poblano is an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant that has good intentions but I think misses the mark on communicating their vision and does not get you good bang for your buck.  

I went here for brunch, as the Cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  The group I went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  When we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a "traditional" asian item, "traditional" mexican item & "fusion" item.  They also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  Most of my party had no idea what they ordered until it arrived.

I thought it was too expensive for what you got.  First, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  Our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  If you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  Many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  You would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.

I got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  When they arrived, it was not what I qualify as a good chilaquiles.  The chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.  I basically had chili cheese nachos and was disappointed.Really really really wanted to love this. I came in with high expectations, especially because I am a fan of Jose Andres's style. He is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. The kitchen needs to see his same vision. 

The layout of the restaurant is stunning. Two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. There are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began. 
Without being longwinded,  Salty! Over priced! Really dissapointing! 

This was the order: Viva China* soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oysters/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. Pescado Frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just OKAY, doesn't justify the cost. Beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --DIMSUM, I've had better. AND the clincher Shrimp Mojo 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--Salty

I don't know if the kitchen was off that day but I rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. We got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.

Our bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. I understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. They should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! Eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry. 

I will definitely continue to visit Jose Andres's other projects but will stay away from China Poblano in the Cosmo when Blue Ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!There are night clubs and there is Marquee the night club. 

A really nice lobby and stuff but this night poor execution. We have table service but it like we have to wait over an hour just to talk to the man handling reservations.  

So yeah after that it was time to jet!I don't know what the fuss about this place is about...

We waited 1.5 hours for a couple slices of pizza. The line wasn't even long at all. We were maybe 15 people deep. This place is just extremely inefficiently set up. The guys are jumping around everywhere to grab a pizza, grab toppings, throw it in the oven, grab parmesan, etc...

The pizza itself was decent but waiting 1.5 hours for 2 slices...Have the people who rave about this place never had pizza before or are they plain drunk? This place is about as standard as pizza gets. Sure, it is not bad, but there is nothing going on here that sets it apart from other competent pizza joints. In the same building, a couple dozen yards away, you find excellent Neapolitan pizza at DOCG. It is a more expensive, but on another realm when it comes to satisfying your taste buds. If you are drunk in the Cosmo and need nourishment, this is not a bad bet. If not, there are plenty of better options.Sub par pizza. Go here for drunk munchies only or you wont enjoy it. It is extremely pricey.  For a large pie with 3 toppings, it was roughly 30 or so. Also the pizza was dry, and if we didn't call ahead the  wait would have been extremely long. Weak pizzaSaying the sushi here is overpriced is an understatement. Especially in a town that has plenty of great local sushi places. Service was a tad overbearing. Asked the waiter to give us something different, he brought us california rolls with real crab. Meh.So I don't know how we got to our table because our host never said a word to us! LOL Then he turned out to be our serve and thank goodness he finally said something then. I started out with a Bloody Mary which was delicious and spicy but no olives or pepperoni like one of the other reviews said! I had the omelet which was OK and I say that because for the price I felt we should have been able to select whatever we wanted in our omelet and unfortunately for me my 3 items for $16 didn't hit the spot.  Their potatoes side dish was awesome though if you like garlic which I do! Honestly for what they served I would have liked Denny's much much much better. Oh and it came with toast and 3 different jams but it was this nasty hard wheat bread! Gross, but I'm sorry but when its late at night I just want some delicious soft white bread. However, considering where they are located (Cosmopolitan) their prices were pretty reasonable ( 2 omelets and a bloody Mary for about $60 not including tip). After all the places I have eaten in Vegas, this is my least favorite! The service was unfriendly and the food was sub par at best.Two $$?  Not!  Try $$$$-$$$$$

Overrated.Food was great in theory, but don't expect any dietary restrictions you have to be competently accommodated. Example: can't eat most grains, so ask for the shrimp on the salad to be grilled (rather than battered and fried), and the avocado not to be on toast. Shrimp grilled, but avocado appears mashed and spread on toast AND the server failed to mention that the fennel on the salad is also battered and fried. This silliness happened after I had already asked about tweaking two other items to be to accommodate dietary restrictions, and was told that everything is "made fresh" except for, apparently, those other two items.

This appears to be part-and-parcel of the service problems referred to by other reviewers; our service was also extraordinarily SLOW. One member of our party waited 10 minutes for his food after the rest had been delivered. 

To top it off, I'm not really sure what the restaurant is doing having the gardener moving around whatever buckets and cloths and chemicals/pesticides he's using in the immediate vicinity of actively eating tables. It's not like the place is open for breakfast during the week, couldn't the owners have scheduled plant maintenance for a morning?Have been here 4 times and the first 3 times it was great then the last time we took some friends in from out of town and one of them ordered a mandarin orange salad. When she got her plate and started eating, the orange tasted bad. I took a bite out of it and yes, it was rotten. She returned the plate and a new one was brought to her but our server stated that when she took it in the back another server and the cook tasted it and it was just fine. I have opened a can of mandarin oranges before and out of the can I have experienced a rotten one in the can which could have been this problem but they cannot judge another one over the one we tasted. I am a cook and know when one is bad, and the one we tasted was BAD. For that we have not returned in a month and I was going there every week. Besides all this we were charged for this salad and most nice restaurants will not charge for something like this as our friend lost her appetite and did not even take her salad to go.The rooms, beds and building are comfortable and clean and we would have had a great experience were it not for the stupid Air Conditioning switching off all night long. The thermostat was on some sort of motion sensor and as soon as we fell asleep it would shut off and let the room get up to 78 degrees or so. My wife and I woke up numerous times in the night and had to walk over to the thermostat to re-set it. Tried calling the front desk at 2AM and got no help. We used Priceline and were put in a handicap accessible room, maybe that had something to do with it but still was frustrating. 
Mentioned it at check out and didn't get any help or sympathy either. We would have had a great experience were it not from this, but waking up several times in the night because your room is too hot kind of ruins an otherwise good experience. 
The hot breakfast was average to above average. Family friendly.I had lunch here September 10, 2013.  I ordered a fish taco, rolled chicken tacos and something that looks like a gordita.

The fish taco arrived at my table cold.  I know what you're going to say, "send it back" but I was hungry and from what I've seen in the past sending food back usually gets you a food with something "extra", like a booger.  Plus, food during a lunch rush should come out fresh and HOT.  If it had been warm it would have only been okay.

The chicken tacos had a tough tortilla shell and the meat inside was also tough to chew.  The chicken didn't have any seasoning or flavor to it.

The "gordita" is covered with black beans, meat and some cheese.  It was warm and okay but was rather bland for my tastes.I took my 2006 Chevy Cobalt in for an oil change this morning (I scheduled an appointment over the phone yesterday). The guy at the desk was friendly and after about 10 minutes, one of the mechanics started working on my car. 

My car has around 122,000 miles so I was expecting them to tell me I needed SOMETHING fixed - turns out, one of my front brake pads and rotors needs replaced. I asked for a written estimate and they gave me one, no problem. When I asked if my car would be safe to drive for a week or two, the guy didn't give me a definite answer - he just said I'd hear squealing. I wasn't expecting him to tell me EXACTLY how many miles my brake pad will last but some idea would have been nice. 

I went in for a regular oil change and that's exactly what I got. For $26.95 (that's WITH a coupon), I hoped they would check the fluids or at least my tire pressure but no. 

Overall, it's a nice enough shop considering it's in San Tan Valley but I'm used to getting a bit more with an almost $30 oil change, that's all.Being a fan of Count Kustoms, my husband & I decided to visit Count Vamp'd. I'm sad to report that we were very disappointed. No one greeted us or was anyone in sight. We actually had to walk inside to flag someone down.  We had to wait for about 30min for our food. Fortunately, they redeemed themselves, because the food was very good & worth the price. Waitress was pleasant but would have been nicer to have that awesome experience from the get go. Such a high profile place, but not standing up to the expectations of us fans. I wish it could have been better.The good:  great music - great cars - a fun place to hang out with friends. 
The bad:  horrible service - severely understaffed and apathetic:  We waited an hour for our waitress to NEVER take our order.  Finally went to the bar and ordered.  They confused our order and we only received part of it.  The worst problem:  when I tried to pay my tab, the waitresses ignored me (not just 1 but 3 waitresses and one man which I assume was a manager).  I waited over 30 minutes at the bar asking staff continuously for my check (they were holding my credit card).  They would just look at me, ignore me, then walk off. This is unforgivable.  I won't be back.Well, on the plus side this is a  Jewish deli near me that's open 24 hours a day. It's hard to find chopped liver, tongue and rugelach after midnight! 
Once, I had the corned beef, and it was good, even served with some coriander spice. Another time, my corned beef was served cold (definite no no) with tomato (gasp!). They asked me if I wanted it toasted. I said no, thinking it would be steamed like all good corned beef and pastrami sandwiches served in delis. I don't want my bread or bagels to be like toast!
Needless to say, I don't take kindly to cold corned beef, and this yid certainly doesn't eat it with a tomato. The matzo ball soup is questionable as well. You start off thinking, ehh this is not bad, but by the end of the bowl, you doubt your order. The small chicken chunks look like something out of a Campbell's can, and you wonder whether this is bouillon or canned soup with a matzo ball plopped in. The black and whites aren't bad, but the rugelach seem more like strudel bite pastries you would buy at Smith's. They're okay, but I'm not sure if they merit the title "rugelach." The bagels are decent. I dunno about this place. It seems like a Jew hasn't been in the kitchen in a very, very long time.I want to love this place, I reeeeeally really do. My boyfriend lives in the Optima so when I saw this little cafe open up, with its little patio by the fountains, I had visions of warm evenings with a glass of wine & appetizers or grabbing a late night latte or cup of gelato. They even have a small market with a little produce, some personal products...even pet supplies! 

On paper, this place sounds awesome.

However, Divine continues to disappoint me, my boyfriend & our friends...even though we all CONTINUE to give them chance after chance after chance. Sad face.

I have worked in different restaurants for over five years. I understand a little of what it takes to make an establishment work. Customer service is HUGE. It is obvious to me that this place has no real management & barely any training for any of their staff. The service is so terrible. No one seems to know what they are doing. The employees are usually friendly, but totally, utterly clueless. Actually had to grab a bag of cat food this morning...apparently $18 for a small bag of food, according to the cashier. When we reconsidered (obviously), she said, "Ohhhh wait, well...how 'bout $6.50?"  WHAT? This is not the first time prices have been negotiated for something from their market.

I have waited for a turkey sandwich for over half an hour. We waited for a pizza for an hour+...& while a man who I assume maybe was the owner? came out to apologize a few times, that was all he did. He seemed totally frazzled & out of it. They had three other tables in the restaurant at that time - COME ON. 

Most of the time they seem to be out of at least half of what is on their menu. I'm 99% sure their "soup" is canned Campbell's. Their hours vary...I think depending on when (or maybe if) someone decides to show up. We went by & thought they had finally closed up for good...but the next night it was open with someone playing live music? So confusing.

I keep going back because their food isn't bad, once you get it. & they have an awesome selection of teas & a pretty nice wine list. & it is just so gosh darn convenient!

I hate to be so negative about a place that has sooo much potential, but seriously. They need to get their shit together. I think their concept is a great idea, but Divine is just falling SO far short.My buddy and I purchased 'learn to drift' package on a daily deal site.  We were very much looking forward to the experience.  I had called the company multiple times to check as to availability, as they don't routinely update their website calendar.  Today is June 7, and they still only show a tentative May schedule.  The main phone number is the owner's cell phone.  I was told we didn't need to make a reservation....just stop by between 5:30 and 9:30 pm on any given day.  We showed up at their new location near the strip just before 9:00 pm.  Initially we were told there were too many people ahead of us and that we should return on another day (despite a $15 cab ride).  Ultimately they agreed to allow us to wait and go that night.  While the potential was there for a worthwhile experience, in the end this was a waste of time.  Of the 5 cars they had, 2 broke down WHILE WE WERE THERE.  Because of the limited space available in the new location (the track is a small portion of an industrial building's parking lot), only one car could go at a time.  While the package was supposed to include a teaching and driving component, due to the limited time available, the pressure of additional people waiting to utilize the 'track', and the difficulty in communicating drifting concepts in a car without a muffler, I felt it would be unsafe for me to attempt these maneuvers so the package turned into a professional drifting our car about 8 times around in a relatively small circle.  In all it was about 10-15 minutes total driving time.  In sum, the management of this operation is elementary, and unable to provide a value added experience.  On the plus side, the two 'driving' employees we met were very friendly and accommodating, and trying to make the best of what they had to work with.  My advice: Save your money...even at the discounted daily deal price, this was no deal.Second time to BLD and so disappointed. The short rib breakfast burrito was dry and tasteless, and the avacodo was missing in action! My friend's chicken fried steak was greasy and gloppy and tough. She could barely cut her steak and the potatoes were cold.  Service was indifferent as in our waiter couldn't have cared less about us. He was absent for much of the time we were there. Hey... how about some water?? What a difference from the last time we were here. Can't rave today.I was in the mood for a burger this evening and decided to try out the Five Guys close by.  It has been a while since I've eaten here since my previous experience (over a year ago) didn't yield any lasting memories.  I walked in at around 6pm on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant was clean and I approached the counter.  This place has a limited menu with burgers, hot dogs and fries along with their varieties.  I ordered a cheeseburger "all the way" and a hot dog with cheese and onions and a medium order of fries.  The cashier informed me that they "ran out of" hot dog buns and if I would mind my hot dog served on a hamburger bun.  I found that a bit odd that a place where hot dogs are one of two menu items that they would run out of buns, but I went ahead and ordered the altered dog.

When I received my order, I dove in to my burger.  Unfortunately, the bottom bun was soggy due to the grease from the burger.  This certainly makes the entire meal a bit unappetizing.  Aside from that, the burger was ok - nothing special but certainly not bad.  The soggy bun really turned me off.  The hot dog was sliced in half and arranged in a hamburger bun.  The dog was Hebrew National and, as expected, was tasty; however, the hamburger bun did not do it justice.  Lastly, the fries, while freshly spliced were good but the quantity was a bit much.

Lastly, given the average taste (and the soggy bun), the price of the meal was a bit on the pricey side.  I would recommend In-N-Out nearby for a fresh burger and fresh-cut potato fries - delicious and reasonably priced.it's funny- i try and not make the mistake of reading reviews while im at a particular restaurant because i dont want my view to be skewed going into it.. but these reviews were pretty spot on, it is kind of a trashy place and my food was well.. just not good. i ordered the queso dip and chips, which really, i dont know how you can screw up, but the queso was gross and the chips were burnt. left a bad taste in my mouth. i will say in their defense, $1.50 beers can't be beat.I didn't expect much from this place.  It was my 14 year old daughter's birthday and she wanted to go here so we did.

This place was definitely built with teenagers and teenager-wannabe girls in mind and I am none of the above so I was mostly annoyed by the bad top 40 music and the cheap-chic decor.  My daughter, of course, was mesmerized.  

What they did here at the old SF is pretty apparent, they melded several different concepts together to form one big, awful monstrosity that is less than the sum of the stolen parts.  Part "brasserie" to poach customers from Mon Ami Gabi next door, they serve French onion soup and mussels and croque monsieur, part Serendipity 3, they serve big, gut-busting ice cream concoctions and frozen hot chocolate, and part Hard Rock Cafe due to their large retail element selling $35 dollar sparkly t-shirts to unwitting parents and douchbaguette rubes.

Whatever.  It is what it is.  My problem was with the service.  The server was rarely seen since I had a couple of kids in tow.  You see, their game is to sell these tooth-achingly sweet cocktails that start @ 18 bucks.  Our server didn't think we'd be ordering any of the fancy cocktails, but she thought wrong.  When she finally made her way to our table to take our drink order and heard me order a Blow Pop she perked up real quick.  Constant upselling and pushing of more cocktails ensued.  When the time came when most people would be ordering a bathtub full of ice cream treats for dessert and we passed due to our profoundly bad experience up to that point, she rolled her eyes and disappeared again.  Just turned and left.  Wow.

I was noticing the same sort of behavior at the tables around us.  The loud, obnoxious drinkers were getting all of the service and the families splitting $22 club sandwiches and not finishing their awful candied cocktails were ignored.  I mean, we spent over 300 bucks for 5 people and the place was barely half full.  It's not like we were drinking ice waters and taking up space.  

SF is not good or cheap or charming.  Even my daughter was disappointed.  They wouldn't even make her a non-alcohol frou-frou cocktail.  What fun is that?Terrible service...  Do you ever go somewhere and just want to end it all while you sit at the table waiting??  Quite unfortunate, however I really have nothing else to say about this experience.  We did eventually get to order food, however no drinks which was quite bizarre till it was worked out.  

We also eventually saw some of the food...  Not 3/4's of it, given the service issues that I may have mentioned, but a few bites here and there.  Needless to say, we didn't actually eat the food, as it was time to take our business elsewhere.  

Good luck with this place if you choice to waste your money here.  With so many other better options within a crawl, I don't understand how this place stays open... boo....My husband and I went here for small lunch last spring after walking around Mill Avenue - Tempe Festival of the Arts. It was our first time to try out this place and it was ok. We are pizza lovers and their pizza???  We think that it needs more seasonings, its kinda BLAND, it NEEDS MORE CHEESE too but the crust is awesome. The meatballs for appetizer was really good and also my rootbeer. Just dissapointed about the pizza.Lunch menu ....salad dressing was salty and the miso soup was not hot just luke warm....meh lets see how the sushi is.... the whole meal was sub par and I don"t think I would go out of my way to go to this place again since we have so many options here in vegas.I ordered the new cheesestake burger combo first time no steak no baked bun as advertised called mgr to complain. I ordered a big carl last week stale bun and one piece of cheese to much sauce sloppy burger.It would be four or a five -- they really are doing a lot right -- but the coffee is just too expensive.  I won't be going there anymore until they lower the prices.  It is a good business strategy, the coffee is good, but the prices are still just plain too high.  If they were the highest in town, but still within reach, I'd go all the time.  But the prices a just plain too high.  I feel like a poor person excluded from a place designed for folks with more disposable income.Came here because I heard that  it is a good place to watch a Patriots game.  That was a really bad recommendation. 

You'd be better off listening to the game on the radio in your car in the parking lot.  

The food was ok.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just sorta generic sub shop fare.  I think that the people here who loved the pizza just don't know decent pizza.  We had the pizza and it wasn't much better than Dominos.I a rooting for this small business, but they just miss the mark here.This was my second time and most likely my last....first time with my relator.... and second with my associate... well.. both times the overpriced menu didnt do much for me....nor the small portions. thanks but no thanks. This wonna-be Fancy Veitnamese just not cutting it..... 
Fancy French..like Vogue..well yes for sure.! 

Wonder how well it will do by next year? Hopefully better.We went recently and found the food okay. I had kibbeh with the lentil soup and my wife had the beef swadharma. I felt first off walking into the place that we were not a priority. While I enjoyed the soup, the lentils were mushy. I grew up eating middle eastern food from an excellent native cook. Her lentil soup was never mushy. I found the kibbeh to be dry and over cooked, but the tabouli and yogurt sauce was very good. My wife's beef swadharma (sp?) was okay and tasted quite gamey. We are not planning on returning, it was too expensive for food that's just okay.Haha pretty whack when we came. I am glad I didn't have to pay cover cause if I did I'd be pretty upset! Used my money wisely to gamble instead...Just left Betty's Nosh, nice decor (2nd star).
First off, horrible optics, 7 servers standing in the middle of restaurant talking, while our sever was working the bar seating and outdoor patrons. Food, overpriced and poorly prepared. Ordered Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce, shredded chicken breast was as dry a possible, peanut sauce...terrible.
Beef and blue mushrooms...same as above different ingredients, same result. Reuben sandwich...store bought shaved corned beef..dry, stale pretzel roll...dry...seeing a theme here...last straw, another customer paid my tab, and I paid theirs and the waitress paid the difference out of her tip...as a fix. Where is the manager???!!! Nice to look at...but way overpriced for this type of service and quality.
Needless to say, we won't be back...oh yeah, this was our first visit.Don't get the SALAD!  I know it's a pizza place, but normally, "upscale" pizza restaurants have great salads.  The topping were decent, but the tomatoes were watery and they use 100% ICEBERG LETTUCE!!  Are you kidding me?  What a let down for a $9.00 salad!  On a positive note, the service was great.This is really average pizza.  The crust almost tasted like sauce and cheese on thick crackers.  The ingredients were fine but neither the cheese nor the sauce stood out as outstanding.  The atmosphere is lovely with new material, nice lighting and the red checkered tablecloths.  Our waitress was lovely but the pizza can be found anywhere.  As I have written elsewhere in my reviews for great, real, napoletana pizza go to Pomo or Andreolis (when they serve it) and, though not as good as Pomo, il Teatro in northern Scottsdale does a pretty good job.Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said "that's the way it is", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more "traditional" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.

Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  

Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.

Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.

Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.

On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.I really like Big Wong. 

This is just to help them improve.

Their service sucks.

Everything is about $5 dollars.

The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now. 

Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.

Anyways they give you super small water cups.

So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. 

So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.

The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?

And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.

I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.

But we are all positive that they got chicken.

She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

No arguing with that right?

So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.

Needless to say she messed up.

There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.

Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.

Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks. 

Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party. 

3.5-4 stars for the food and price but 2 overall.First of all, it's not a smoothie. It's syrup and ice. Should have just got a soda. At least my teeth wouldn't feel like cavities were literally forming as I drank. All I wanted was a healthier option and now I'm going into a sugary diabetic coma and probably going to miss my flight. Overpriced airport fare as expected. Blah.The Good: Can't go wrong with outlet prices, with lower tax (compared to cali) it's a nice place to buy without costing too too much. The store has relatively newer items compared to the Primm outlet store with saffiano items in display.

The bad: the store is always packed with people and there's not so much of a walking space either. 

The Ugly: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Yes it's all caps because it's the only way I can make my words come across with the horrid customer service they have. I had purchased something from the Primm for mother's day, decided to take a quick peek at this store and I decided another bag would be better suited for my mommy. Lo and behold when I was discussing this issue with the guy at the register. He was just so standoffish and not accommodating at all. Standing at the register for more 20 minutes or so without any update of what the hell is going on. When the return/exchange was almost complete he said he couldn't credit back the remaining balance, so I had to look for something close to the balance account. When I told him I needed time to look around and decide he just gave me a look and a sigh of being annoyed. Well, sorry to be such a nuisance mister. But I AM a paying customer you know. He could've said those terms while I was standing there for 20 mins doing nothing. Not going back here ever again.I really did not like this place at all.  The weird thing is . . . . it wasn't the bouncers, the bartenders, or anyone that worked at the club that made me not want to come back.  Everyone seemed really nice and the service was good.  Maybe I went on an off night (Saturday)?  Weird.  Anyway the crowd was hodge-podge of people old men (40s, 50s), short horny Asians, and the jersey shore.  I was mainly disappointed at the lack of good looking people.  You go somewhere like this thinking there will be at least a few attractive men (like in Vegas) but there really weren't that many. Trust me my standards are not that high.  So if you are an average looking dude, this place would be a good place for you to score a hot chick since there was a decent amount.  The odds are in your favor!  Sorry if this sounds shallow but my expectations were really a lot higher for this place.  Especially after hearing all this hard to get by the bouncer business.  Which it wasn't, but I went early (10:30-11PM)  

And one more thing that made this a terrible place to dance  . . . . . the DJ kept playing all these awesome songs, and would remix them with techno so in the end it all sounded the same (techno music, boo).  There were hip hop/top 40 songs but they all sounds like techno music because the dj kept mixing them.  It was terrible (IMO).Only place I've been to that messes up your order twice. I have been coming here for years now and haven't had any major problems just a few mix ups here and there but this time was a little aggravating. I ordered a simple omelette and the order is messed up, no big deal. I send it back and the waitress was happy to make a new one and apologized which was good...BUT when my new omelette arrives it was messed up again! They had forgot some ingredients and the way they presented it looked like they threw it together recklessly. The hash-browns were soggy and drenched in oil and the omelette was dry and crumbled apart from the first stroke of the knife. All in all was a pretty frustrating experience.I couldn't find anything worth eating, even for the inexpensive price. Dinner was only $9.99 with a Station's Card.

I arrived at 7:30p.m. and most of the food had been sitting under the heat lamps for well over an hour. Dried out sub-par pizza, hot dogs reminiscent of a 24hour seven-eleven rotisserie, and a tiny tex-mex section that should never have emigrated from tex-Mexico are some of the fare options diners are subjected to. 

Save your money and get your fill elsewhere.I thought this place was going to be better based on reviews but I guess not. You enter in through the hookah place next door and you are obligated to get your own drinks. I love Indian food, I make it at home all of the time but sometimes I like to venture out. The lowdown:

*I got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt.
*Mattar paneer also needed salt and spice, I thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?No creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be. 
*My partner's lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top. The biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly, if not all fat. 
*Basmati rice needed salt as well, and I'm not a salt fiend! More oil would have helped to make it moist. 
*Garlic Naan was crispy and hot.

In conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good. I was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had. If you want one of the best experiences go to Royal Taj here in Tempe, if you want some of the best Indian food in your life go to Delhi Palace in Flagstaff at Woodlands Village.The salon was clean, and blessedly, at 10 in the morning, empty. But, there were 4 people available to assist me and 2 of them were having a slight argument about who'd help me. I double checked to make sure I wore deodorant, and my face didn't look funny. (Maybe it was because I didn't have on makeup?)
Anyhow, I got a spa pedicure and full set. It was just okay. They didnt ask if I wanted any extras added, like a paraffin wax or getting my cuticles removed. Either I take good care of myself or the woman helping me was really bored. And, I had to correct her several times in shaping my nails, as I prefer oval and she kept trying to make them "square with rounded edges". For a short, full set and spa pedi, cost was $55. I tipped $5.
All in all, I could take it or leave it. But I'll probably be leaving it, alone.I love that this place has gluten free pizza- when I went to pick up my order I also saw that they have GF beer too. I was visiting my sister in Vegas and everyone wanted pizza but since im GF we had to find a place for me too. We ordered 2 small pizzas- 1 plain, 1 veggie with pepperoni added. We also got a GF pizza with black olives, onions, pepperoni, green peppers as well as an order of wings and a garden salad. When we got there- the owner greeted us and was VERY friendly. Service was amazing which I always appreciate. However, the food totaled to $70!!!! SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!! well I thought, lets just see how good this pizza is. We got back and opened everything up. The wings literally looked like something that was previously frozen- they were also very small and the sauce was lackluster. They tasted ok- but for $8 I would expect a little more. The salad was fine- totally what I would expect for a small $5 salad. The 2 small pizzas were a hit- everyone really liked them. The sauce was very flavorful. 
The gluten free pizza- thats where it goes awry. The actual crust was GREAT- however, it looked like the pizza was cooked JUST to the cheese started to melt. It was terribly under done. The onions were just about 2 spoonfuls of diced white onions, the green peppers were very lacking as well. I would like to give this place a 4 or 5 star review but for $70 that pizza just was not good enough.First timer to this restaurant but an old soul when it comes to Italian food. The restaurant has a nice pleasant vibe, I sat at the bar, it's long and comfortable and provides a great view (I love to see what other people are having). I ordered half a bottle of a Cabernet from Chile, they have a good offering of wines and not expensive at all, love the option of a half bottle. I also ordered the Tuscan Grill Mix, Lamb Chops, chicken and sausage They bring you bread and olive oil, the bread was a bit on the burned side, same as the table next to me, well actually theirs was almost black burned!. Then the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find a bit of skinny couple of lamb chops a very thin chicken breast a what resembled a think burned hotdog. Unfortunately the lamb was kind of dry and over cooked, same with the chicken, you would expect dry chicken breast at Olive garden but not here. It was not bad, well seasoned but far from where it should be. Disappointing. Desert menu needs a couple more offerings but that is my humble opinion, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, I know this being an Italian restaurant I should probably had the Tiramisu or the cannoli but oh well, the cake was good, nothing special.
Bottom line, and my rating is always on function of this: would I come back? Probably not, there are way to many other options to try instead on spending this kid of money to try to find that good dish in this restaurant (probably there is a few) but not again.The food was good, however I was very dissatisfied with the service. I ordered for delivery (moving day...we needed sustenance), and although we are well within the distance (a little over a mile away) they advertise as their delivery radius (I wanna say 4 miles?), their delivery service "doesn't deliver to McDowell." Really??

So, whatever, I went for take-out and checked-in for the 10% discount. However, when I arrived, there was no freakin parking on the street they are on, and no parking available for almost a half mile. (We are new to AZ; we don't know much at this point.) 

Again, whatever, we're freakin hungry. When I go to pick it up, the check-in code on my phone isn't working, and apparently they can't figure out how to just give a 10% discount. (My phone showed I checked in, but the code wouldn't come up.) Seems the owner is super cheap. I mean, giving me $5 off and having a chance for a return customer seems like a better way to run a business than pinching every penny from the customers. 

I will not return. This review is more about frustration with poor management than the employee who helped me when I picked up. She was kind and seemed afraid of what the boss would do if she gave a discount without a code. Seriously, give the customers and employees a break.After a great time at Copper Blues I wound up here. Pretty lackluster experience and this is sad because I had high hopes for this place. There was nothing blatantly bad about my experience but the vibe, the clientele, everything about just kind of sucked. There was nothing about the vibe or atmosphere that made me want to stay...in fact I left after one beer. 
The place just opened up, so it's quite possible that everyone is stil getting their bearings so I'll probably pop in one more time in a few months to see if the vibe is the same. 

The bar is indoor/outdoor and opens onto a a concrete patio that is definitely the best feature at this location. The patio has awesom eastern views of downtown and it's really cool in the late afternoon early evenings. Unfortunately they HAVE to do something about the patio high chairs because they are uncomfortable as hell.So ya' want: Food. Beer. Boobs and Sports huh? Like most who try to "do it all", this place excels at NONE.

If you want great food go to Cibo.
If you want great beer go to the Roosevelt Tavern or Lost Leaf.
If you want great boobs go to the Hi Liter.
If you want great sports go to Coach & Willies.

(all of those are within a few blocks of this place)

If you want all of 'em in one great spot ... good luck to ya' champ.Going to be real simple. .i have lived in the area 4years..and one night i went on a walk and wandered in here.. and yeah..wasn't expecting much..but the food was bland..and eh

But hey for a cheap breakfast why not huh? Comparable to an independent dennysSo I call in an order and am quoted 20 minutes.  I leave house 15 minutes later and show up about 2 minutes before the quoted time.  I am greeted with a "you're here early, we haven't made it yet". I wait 25 more minutes as they casually make the pizza.

Would be a one star if they didn't have a decent check in special.  

Oh and the pizza? In the immortal words of the Yelp rating system, "Meh. I've experienced better."Visited several times here during our stay at THEhotel for coffee, snacks, etc. and every time the servers at the register had a look of indifference. Service was what it was...a dud. They didn't smile, and they weren't rude, but I find a smile goes a long way these days.

The pastries at this particular location were just OK and the cupcakes were borderline bad and I'm certain they weren't fresh.  

The only item worth going back for was the little mozzarella tomato salad.  The tomatoes were suprisingly fresh, the mozzarella was as well, and the pesto dressing was delicious. 

If a caprese snack wasn't what you were looking for, then keep walking into Mandalay Bay.  It's worth it.Service: 1.5
Don't really review much but because of my experience had to write something. First off, this is the strangest restaurant I've been to. It's inside a Hair and Nail Salon/Spa inside a strip mall. Couldn't find it initially, then after 5 minutes of looping the parking lot, found a small sign next to the Salon sign. We walked in and there were two gentlemen in front of us waiting to order. They ordered, then we ordered. The lady who took our order told us it would be a few minutes. We waited for 15 minutes then the lady came up to us and said there are two other orders in front of us so it would be a few more minutes. So we decided to go out and come back. We waited outside eating ice cream because it took so long. She came outside with two bottles of water to apologize then another 15 minutes went by before we got our meal "to go".

Left Office: 12:55pm
Arrived in Parking Lot: 1:10pm
Got Lost for 5 Min: 1:15pm
Ordered our food: 1:20pm
Left the restaurant: 2:05 pm
Got Back to Office to Eat: 2:18pm.

Didn't know this was going to be a journey....

Food: 2.5
The food was ok at best. We ordered all the BAOs on the menu. 
1. Duck Bao - Good flavor (probably the best there) Could add more meat though. Just one slice of duck.
2. Pork Belly Bao - Two slabs of 1 inch thick slabs of pork belly. A bit dry.
3. Chicken Bao - Extremely dry chicken. Crispy skin but tasted like they definitely overcooked the chicken.
4. Tofu & Mushroom Bao - Combination of ingredient blended well. Fried tofu but the sauce made it softer. 

Also ordered the Chicken salad because they ran out of sesame noodles. The chicken salad was not good at all. Dry chicken meat with cucumber slices and spring mix? To add to that found a hair in my salad. I know it's not my hair because I don't have hair on my head and it was longer than an eyelash.I was here during the opening.  It's ok.  I like the interior design and theme, however the food leaves a lot to be desired. I hope they improve with time.

The flavor simply isn't that strong would be my biggest complaint.  We asked for lots of extra dipping sauce to slather the mud bugs in, but it just wasn't that tasty.

Prices weren't posted anywhere when I was there so it was annoying having to ask.

I saw a couple of notes about the sweet potato bites.  I think this must be a frozen food from Sysco or somebody.  BB King's BBQ restaurant at the Mirage has the same ones and they serve them with caramel sauce that really finishes the dish off nicely.

Also, having had many  crawfish boil in my hometown of Houston, I'm still flabbergasted how West Coast places charge per piece of corn and potato.  It should be included!!! 

All in all, it was ok. Probably won't return.  Having it here just wanted me to do it at home since I can do it way better!

Note: the crab legs are frozen.  Mine were just plain old resulting in a rubbery texture and the meat not filling the shell. The owner took them back after my complaint, bit it was disappointing.  The shrimp were a good size 24-30U I think. No tiger prawns, but decent.It's not enough to inspire me to change the star rating on my review, but it is worth noting that David, the General Manager of Rice and Company, contacted me to express his concern and regret about the lack of service I received on my visit. That's the kind of attention to customers I would have liked while I was at the restaurant. Maybe there will be some kind of trickle down effect, or whatever the economic term might be, but doubtful I'll volunteer to test that firsthand the next time I'm in town.We ate here due to the good reviews on Yelp.  However, we were very disappointed.

When we sat down we noticed that the table was dirty.  We mentioned this to the server and got some strange answer about how people don't use the tables.  No idea what she was trying to say (she spoke very good english).  My wife got some napkins and washed the table herself.  The server didn't even apologize.

We ordered the asian chicken salad and won ton soup for appetizers.  For the main dishes we ordered Chicken and broccoli and pan fried noodles with beef.

The chicken salad didn't come as described on the menu.  It had maraschino cherries  instead of dried cranberries.  There were no nuts on the salad and the dressing had no taste (supposed to be an asian vinaigrette)  and there was no sesame oil.  If they were out of so many things, they should have told us when we ordered it.  The salad just tasted like lettuce with very little other flavor. 

The won ton soup also had no flavor.  The broth tasted like boiled water and the vegetables and dumplings added nothing to the soup.

Likewise, the 2 main dishes were OK, but lacked any real flavor. I added soy sauce (which I never do) so that it would taste like something.

We tried to explain these problems to the server, but got nowhere.  She didn't even say she was sorry for the poor food.  She really needs to learn how to be a server at a restaurant.  She needs to carry customer comments to the kitchen and apologize to the customer that they weren't happy.

Very poor experience. We will never return and I hope others read this and go elsewhere.So I went here thinking it was the same as the Island Sushi on Eastern, and it's not. Yes, they do make hawaiian specialties like malasadas and coco puffs, and chantilly cake. Asked the waitress if the malasadas are like Leonard's bakery and she said, she didn't know who that was. Oh... no (not the good ono). I tried the malasadas and coco puffs. Not good. Malasadas were dense, doughy, and okay. Maybe I've been spoiled by the good stuff. The coco puffs were not good either. Okay, the chocolate pudding was fine, but the puff was hardened and soggy by sitting in the refrigerator a long time and the pudding soaked in on the bottom. The macadamia nut frosting was just frosting, not much mac nut taste at all, and it was frikkin too sweet. I'm afraid to try the chantilly cake. Although with Misti Y's info about rolls being 50% off, I might try some when I hang out for the local music.it's basically byrd's with different waitstaff and slightly better food*. same mostly dismal beer selection save a few local and/or craft brews. if you like miller lite, sports and fried food, you will love this place. 

* the appetizers were ok, but mostly fried (green beans, poppers, curds, etc.). my friend ordered a grilled portabella (which was on a nice ciabatta roll and came with decent sweet potato fries)... and found a large piece of plastic in her sandwich. gross enough to begin with, but leads me to believe that they don't even use fresh ingredients, because it looked like a wrapper. yuck.Meh.  The perfect descriptor for two stars and also my reply to our waitress when asked how my buffalo chicken wrap was..."meh."  

This bar is close to home and we enjoy playing trivia here on Tuesday nights...but that's as far as my enjoyment goes.  The service is always slow and inattentive.  

Ordered soda water with a lemon.  15 minutes (no joke) later, our waitress shows up with an icy cold glass of...nothing - empty - for the pitcher of beer.  Which would be great if that's what I'd ordered...

As mentioned previously, the buffalo chicken wrap was less than perfect.  Slathered in an a thin (read liquidy/messy), over spicy sauce that dominated the flavor of the other wrap ingredients...and who wouldn't want to enjoy the full flavor of lifeless diced tomatoes and romaine lettuce?!

I'll return for trivia, but dread the slow service and have sworn off the food.

Namio's is all-around meh.The two stars in this review are for the food alone. We just moved to the area and our Jason's Deli in the area we previously lived burned down and had not been reopened by the time we moved. The salad bar and soup were very good and my kids enjoyed their pb&j's. My wife got a ham and cheese sandwich and said the ham was very good. The great disappointment at this establishment was the staff. While not all of them were this way, most were not very friendly and seemed frustrated when you asked for assistance. When I was at the register, it was obvious the guy was new, but no one seemed to want to help him, acting as if they were busy when the store was mostly empty. The other staff would then get frustrated when he would do something wrong and they would have to fix it. If they would spend more time training him, they would have much less frustration.If your looking for a anime themed restaurant this is as close as your going to get in  Las Vegas. Sadly, the ramen bowls are not up to par with places like Shuseki up the road or ramen houses in LA. 

We had the miso & shoyu ramen both came with 2 wafer thin slices of pork, fish cake and a pinch of green onion, bamboo shoots & bean sprouts at $8 a bowl.

An Anime Ramen shop is a great idea for all us anime fans but they need to take a look at the ramen shops in LA & bring it to Las Vegas.Don't waste your money on the food. The food is over fried (in old nasty oil) and lacks edibility.  The margaritas might have given me an instant cavity. The beef is low quality and the fries were literally, the worst I have ever had in my life.

That being said, if you want to stop in for a beer and catch the last minutes of a game, moes is a decent option.  Just don't pick up that menuOk really, I can make better pizza than this. Its over priced which is no surprise since it's in a casino on he strip. The pizza crust is decent but the sauce lacked flavor and I thought the cheese was very good quality, you can tell when you bite into it. Its also greasy. You want pizza you ll do better at one of the many pizza places outside the strip. 2 slices, 1 soda and 1 beer $20.

The price for a whole pizza is like $25This barley got 2 stars. Took my family there for Mothers Day Brunch and although some of the breakfast items were tasty the rest was less than desirable. The table was filthy with gum under the chairs that you had to scoot in. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was 100 outside and 85 inside. The server we had was sweet and attentive but the serving staff at the buffet were rude and presentation was not important to them at all. By the way assorted desserts really means some dry coffee cakes and nothing to write home about. Also they charged us for my nephew who should have been free and even Ice tea was not included in the brunch price. We will not being going back there. We did mention this to the Manager on our way out very politely and we just were looked at like we were crazy.. you win some and you loose some they just lost 5 customers :(I got a rib eye it was ok. The potatoes augratin was gross way too much onion. Service was friendly. The fries were horrible and the crab cakes seasoning wasn't good. The only thing I enjoyed was the bread basket. Way too pricey for the food being so bad. They really like to season there meat so if you don't like salty ask for noneI miss when this place used to be Mama Luigi's.  I've been here twice since it has been Sunset Pizzeria and although the menu is still very similar... the customer service and food are just not that great.  I was not impressed when our server told us that we could get our own drinks at the drink station, and then two minutes later a group of guys comes in and she takes their drink order and brings it over to them.  Granted, the drink station is not that far away.  But, if drinks are self service, should't they be for everyone?  At the end of our experience, our bill was $50 for 3 calzones and drinks.  I just do not feel that it was worth that much!I've ordered take-out from this place four times.  The first two times were fine.  The second time they didn't make the order until I arrived and then it was totally wrong.  This morning I had a chance to observe the restaurant for a few minutes while waiting for my food and the management is poor. 

The food is fine but I wouldn't expect much for service.So so. The menu lacked lots of green-vegi choices. Name should be various meat and tofu proteins and green drinks. Veggie Garden Burger was just a pale bocaburger (no veggie or garden in it), my wife a life long vegetarian could not eat it.Ordered burger "med. well" for take out even had the girl repeat back my order & made sure it will be med. well only slightly pink she said. Well when I got home with it...it was pretty much RARE TO MEDIUM RARE !!! Will NOT be ordering food there anymore. Too many other places that will get your order correct. The chips were good though. The order was ready on time.Enjoyed this place 4 Stars worth on Grand Opening day nearly a year and a half ago, but it's taken me a while to get back over here as it's a 26-mile drive each way.

Today the food choices were somewhat the same as they are on Day One, except that they were down to 108 items this time (plus sauces & dressings) from 130 at the start.  There were some things to praise about the place today, such as lots of shrimp dishes including Stuffed Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Shrimp and Ceviché, and for dessert there were four kinds of real ice cream, chilled to the right temperature (not so cold that you can't scoop it!).

The problems today that cost them two stars were these:

*  A lot of the food that should have been hot was either lukewarm, or worse, room temperature.  NOT OK!     :-O

*  There was a nasty smell in the place.  Not all over, but I picked up a whiff of it here and there in the serving area.  The Men's room had an odor about it too, although it looked clean.  (No, it wasn't Pine Sol, although I think that stinks too!)  Whatever these smells are, they need to find them & get rid of them!     :-O

*  They have a little Sushi & also a Mongolian style BBQ with 4 meats, but neither were anywhere near as good as what I have just had (twice in the last few days) over at the new China Olive in Sun City, for example.

Sorry, it's only 2 Stars this time.     :-|

Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $7.99/$7.19 Sr.People who work out at this facility use the class room for weight lifting and so on, and get upset if you use the room as it was intended - for a video class - even if you tell them they are welcome to continue doing their own weight lifting in there while you do the class. One of the personal trainers gave me a weight lifting routine that was  much too intense based on my size and ability, and resulted in my getting injured. The facility is okay if all you plan to do is use the cardio equipment and lift weights on your own, but it is not meeting my needs and the management of the shared space is minimal.I came here with 2 of my girlfriends. We had bought a groupon and wanted to give "Foot Spa" (a whole body massage) a try. So we called around 6pm to let them know 3 girls were going to come in at 10pm... Then my friend called and the guy who picked up could not understand anything, and she kept raising her voice hoping he would understand. So I grabbed the phone and let him know that 3 girls were coming at 10pm and he kept saying SEVEN! I said ONE ZERO and he just said "Ok 9" I said NO 10PM! And he said "ah" and I thought that was the end of it.... Then he asked for my number... OMG! I started with "702" and he said "352" and I just said nvm, forget the area code. Started to state my number, he repeated the ALL the wrong number and I just went with it. SO FRUSTRATING.

So we got there, didn't know what to expect. She put my feet in warm water that got pretty cold fast. And made me lay back. There was SO many noises and talking during my massage. You might as well keep the lights on and massage me outside. (JK) But really, it was bad. 

Massage was nice but the next day my whole body hurt and my toes hurt so bad. Maybe she went to hard? Idk. 

After, they pressure you tip at least $10 or you are basically not welcomed. We gave them a $100 to break and they took it and walked away then got mad cause we didn't leave the a $100 tip and started to talk in their language. All three of us left a $10 each tip. Then left. Will not be back, whatsoever. I would go to a foot spa place again....Just not this one. I'm so disappointed.Empty, dirty, and poorly stocked.  That's all I really need to say about my stop into the Einstein Bros Bagels at 90th street and Shea.  It doesn't help that I am not a fan of this chain to begin with, but this location certainly doesn't help change my opinion of Einstein.

My wife and I had breakfast plans that were canceled at the last minute, so we just wanted something quick and easy before heading into a store in the huge shopping center Einstein is conveniently located in.  There certainly wasn't a crowd at 11am on Sunday morning, but that didn't stop the dining room from having a couple of dirty tables and trash cans filled above the rim.  Maybe the employees were busy making bagels since they were already out of several varieties?  No.  At least that's not the impression we were given when we asked if they had anymore of some of the missing bagels and were just told "we're out."  I get that you don't want to overstock, but I don't think our expectations are too high if we hope the bagels we like are in stock just before lunchtime.I am a little confused by the restaurant and unsure if my review should go here or be listed as a new business. The reason for the confusion is the combination of names that exit. My girlfriend said she recently saw a new restaurant called Don Camaron and wanted to take her mom out for her birthday. She gave me the name and the general location, but I was unable to find it on Yelp or other services. Google turned up similarly named restaurants in other places. Ultimately we found the information on Facebook. As we pulled up we noted the sign stated Don Camaron was "Now Open". We pulled into the parking lot of Urban Heat. As I walked toward the restaurant the sign on the sidewalk read Don Camaron, but the name above the door read Urban Heat. Instead the decor had Urban Heat, but also a logo of the Don Camaron shrimp. The menu read Urban Heat (but had the shrimp logo), the paper ring around the napkin read Urban Heat, and upon check out the receipt reads Urban Heat. Perhaps it is going through a transition and it is both places? The waitress that I had was also very new. She didn't seem to understand me well and she was unfamiliar with the food. 

It appears to be a bar/restaurant, which is how Urban Heat (and the receipt) describe it. The menu included mostly appetizers, tacos, fish, and shrimp. The back page showed multiple types of beer in bottles and draft, but they did not have all of those. One draft they have Bud, Bud Light, Michelob, and "Amber Bock". I asked what Amber Bock and the server did not know. It was either Michelob or Dos X. Either way, it was decent and $2.75 but I received an additional $1.83 discount (maybe happy hour?). There were only maybe 6 other people there besides the 5 of us, so it wasn't a big crowd if it was happy hour.

We received chips and salsa first (free). My girlfriend's son ordered a hamburger ($8) and I was surprised how quickly it arrived. It was a good size burger served with a side of fries. It was cooked just a little more well-done that I would have liked. My girlfriend's daughter & mom each ordered the Coco Camaron, which is a coconut with shrimp ceviche and shrimp inside. It also had two whole shrimp with heads, eyes, and legs (yuck) mounted on top of the coconut ($16). My girlfriend went with the fish filet ala plancha that was served with a very tasty side of rice and a nice looking salad. This was a nice-sized portion ($9) and I was a little sad that I hadn't ordered it, but I was afraid it would resemble the fried whole fish that was also shown on the menu (yuck again). Instead I went with the nachos (add carne asada), which was supposed to be $6.99 + $2 for the carne, but it appears I was only charge $6.99). My girlfriend also ordered a shrimp cocktail for $12. Throw in a pina colada for $5.50, a $1.83 bottle of water, and a $1.83 bottle of coke - then my girlfriend's daughter decided she would rather have had a hamburger and fries like her brother (another $8) and soon the bill was $95 for the 5 of us.

Some pros - I liked the live Maine lobster claw machine. I don't know if the customer gets to eat the lobster if the claw game picks it up, but it was interesting. The deco was nice, but again with the differences in the name I don't know if that will stay. The fish filet was another highlight of the meal.  Otherwise, the hamburgers were a little too well done, my nachos were just okay (and certainly a much smaller portion than the fish filet plate), the server was unsure of the menu, the beer selection was limited, and I wasn't sure what restaurant I was actually visiting. Whatever restaurant it was (Don Camaron or Urban Heat), I don't think it was $95 good. Maybe if there are some big happy hour specials and the name gets worked out it would be worth revisiting, but right now I don't think so.Hate to say this, but I really wanted to like this place. Everything started out great, we were impressed with the beer selection and we ended up getting a great beer flight. That was all that was good about this place. 

After ordering drinks, our waiter disappeared. We finally had to ask another waiter to send him over so we could order food. If only we had known, we would have stopped after ordering beer...

We started with the "Devils on Horseback" (bacon-wrapped dates) and they were shameful and bland. You want a real bacon-wrapped date? Head over to La Cave inside Wynn next door. 

I had high hopes for the mussels since they came highly recommended from the staff, however those hopes were dashed. They came in a giant pot (not good for sharing, even though our waiter said they were...) and were also tasteless.

We stopped ordering after that since the food was so disappointing. We ended up having Dinner Part 2 later on that evening since we were still hungry after leaving Public House.

Skip it, there are a thousand better places within a stone's throw of this place.Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.

I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.

Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.

And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). 

So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, "Really?"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning "Really?" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an "epic fail". 

I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.

BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, "Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns."

Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast.The pancakes where hard and the butter wasn't soft! It's ok but I wouldn't go here again...I ordered a graduation cake 2 weeks prior to the event. I was very specific with no buttercream frosting. It was to be a red velvet cake with whipped frosting with school colors. I drove to downtown Mesa approx 13 mi one way after texting the lady that I was coming for the cake. Never heard back and it was after the time the cake was supposed to be ready. When I got there, I waited a full 5 minutes before anyone asked if they could help me, seemed like I was inconveniencing them. They asked me what time I needed the cake, then I knew something was up. I said "well, I'm here now" I was told they were putting the finishing touches on the cake and that they would be happy to delivery it around 4pm free of charge. 
When the cake finally arrived at my house around 445. It looked like buttercream. I asked about refrigeration, one girl said no,I didn't have to refrigerate it, the other said yes I did need to because it was whipped frosting. I pointed out that it did not look like whipped frosting. To late now, I needed a cake.
Sure enough, when it came time to serve the cake, it was buttercream. For $55 this cake was not spectacular at all, highly disappointing.  Definately not what I wanted or ordered. 
Still wondering what actually happened, I sent a text message to the lady who made the cake and told her that the cake was not all what I ordered and I wanted to know what actually happened since I got 3 different stories. She then proceeded to tell me that she made a cake with whipped frosting and the  colors were beautiful.  When she went to the fridge to check on it later,  all the colors had bled into the frosting and they had to remake the cake.
Why couldn't they just be honest and say that in the first place? She apologized a few times then zaid she would be happy to make me another cake free of charge. I agreed,  but I think I would rather have my money back since I drove out there, and was lied to a few times before I finally got the actual story. She offered to make another cake, I would rather have my money back which was never offered. I won't be back and its too bad because she was recommended by a friend who is a caterer.I just had their BLT Italiano (to go) for dinner and what a RIP OFF!!! 

First of all, its not worth 11.95 and secondly it wasnt really a panini it was more of a regualr sandwich and the side ceaser salad I got,... wow!! how cheap can you get, I swear I got about 10 pieces of lettuce and no croutons. The only thing is the flavor was good but just a tad bit too salty.

I cant speak for the rest of their food but I wouldnt go back .Normally my family is particular about sticking to the tried and true Chinese restaurants. It is rare to get my mom and dad to deviate from their regular rotation. When my dad suggested this place, it took me by surprise. The Yelper in me is always in search of a hidden gem.

HK Garden is not that kind of place. It is jammed pack with tables of screaming, uncontrollable children. The Asian teacher in me wanted to expel some corporal punishment, but decided against it. A few stern looks were enough to get them into the seat next to their mother. 

The service is lacking. Of course, it is lacking, it is a Chinese restaurant. Of course, I am going to get ignored when I need them most. 

The food is a hit or a miss. 

The seafood and tofu hot pot: hit. 
The mapo tofu: miss.
The porks blood and intestine hot pot: hit.
The HK sweet and sour spare ribs: miss.
The whole fried flounder: hit.

Apparently if $40+ is spent, you get a free entree. We got the flounder. There is something else for $80+.Went there on a Friday night at 7. They were out of chips for the rest of the night. First margarita was goof the second one had no tequila in it.  Guacamole was tasteless except for the lemon or lime taste. Street taco were ok.  Couple next to us at the bar said they weren't come back. We won't either.Been here twice and disappointed both times.

Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.

Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like "HEY WE'RE READY". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.

Tortilla soup tasteless.
Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price..
Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.

Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.

Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like "Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;) 

Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.

ALL SUMMED UP:
Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED)
Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :)
Atmosphere: trendy.

I'll go to Chipotle next time.Great Prices. Clean and very well stocked. The one thing I dislike is the parking it's always full of shopping carts that obstruct parking.I was in the area this morning, and stopped in for my "hang." They didn't have dark roast. The woman said she'd brew some, but laughed at me when I suggested that coffee prepared with different methods tasted different. So I left, and went to a different location where they had dark roast available, and treated me and their own product with respect.This place reminds me of a slightly upgraded Food 4 Less.

Yes there are items that are slightly cheaper than Walmart or Albertsons, but since it is located on the other side of town for me (215 & Stephanie) the .50 cents savings or so is not worth the drive.

The store itself is pretty clean. But I'm not really liking the warehouse feeling.

I do like how they offer certain items you can select the servings on your own (rice, variety of nuts and candy, etc).

Overall I won't make a separate trip just to visit this store. Even if I'm on this side of town, I'm still hesitant to stop by.There is always a line running all the way out the door for dinner time.  Sometimes you can wait for an hour or less but sometimes it's more.  However, I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour for.  Food is okay but nothing really stands out that would make me come back again.  Service is minimal, and the only good thing I can really say about this place is pretty much the price.Hard not to be frustrated with this place. Asked for a burger, medium rare, everything on the side. Got a burger, medium, everything on it, plus fries that had been clearly sitting around. Seriously. You're a sports bar. You can't screw up burgers. Although, given the number of televisions, I don't think I'd classify this place as a sports bar. The waiter finally came over when I had two bites left to ask me how the burger was. Well, dude, it sucked. My wife's flatbread?  No bueno. So then, the manager comes over and asks me if I want another one. Really?   Then he asks me If I want one to go. Look, the burger sucked when it was fresh from the kitchen. To go?  No thanks. Besides, WTF?  No, I can't eat a second burger. I'm a big fella, but come on, man. A second burger?  I really want to like local places that are not chain restaurants.  Keep the dollars local. However, I think I'll stick to Blue 32.I shop craft stores for fine art supplies... Hobby Lobby, while way more organized, is always priced 2-3$ more than Michael's for the same merchandise handled the same way (poorly). 
I only go here when I can't find it at Michael's, or I have a gift card that needs to be used... please no more gift cards here.. omg please... lol2.5 Stars

I've been here five times now and have realized that I only like one thing on their menu.  I will not trash New Asian Star.  I am only assuming that the folks here are all family, but they are so super friendly!

I've had the Thai fried rice twice and five other items on my other visits here.  I can't reiterate the friendliness of the staff here and the superb customer service.  I have no problem knowing I found a spot for great Thai fried rice.  I understand any type of food is subjective and would recommend everyone to stop here and try it out for yourself.This place makes Sbarro look gourmet.

The big up is that the place is clean and attractive enough and the service was polite. But the pizza (we got 2 cheese slices and a medium drink) was lackluster. The crust was a little thick and flavorless and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side and lacked depth. 

Usually "by the slice" places will heat your slice in the oven before presenting it, but we were given two congealed slices right from under the heat lamp.

It was under $7, so for the price, if you're drunk, this gets the job done.  But, if you're looking to actually enjoy a slice of pizza, I'd go elsewhere.

(This review is specifically for the Pizzeria and not the Ristorante, as I've never eaten there and haven't tried anything other than their pizza by the slice.)I read the reviews on Yelp and I almost didn't give this place a try, but I figured since its close and new to me, I wouldn't judge till I tried it. 
Honestly, I wouldn't say the pizza was gross or disgusting by any means. It was just okay... Some reviews mention how it tasted like frozen store bought pizza. I'd say that is very accurate. It wasn't gross, just didn't seem fresh. The crust had to be frozen before they made it. 
DO NOT get the chicken wings, I ate 1 and was finished. They taste just like those frozen chicken wings you get from the freezer section at Walmart. No Bueno!I work in Vegas so sometimes I just want something quick and healthy.  I love their wraps and usually like their smoothies but this time I was not impressed with my smoothie. The smoothie tasted like frozen sugar water.  They need to get to the healthy basics of fruits any nothing else.Awful awful customer service. Aside from not being able to hear your order they constantly repeat back the wrong order. When asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it. This situation happen to me twice in one day and 1x today.Service has become slow and poor. Food still ok. We had to ask for water 5 times by walking up to waitress. Took a long time for bill. They need more service help now.The location is great. Right next to LVAC and the tanning salon. I am a fan of Jay Cutler so when he recommended this place I decided to go check it out right away. The food is good; not exceptional but good.
 I was disappointed by the customer service. I will pay extra if the customer service is good. The men at the location were courteous and polite, the woman however, was rude and seemed to be very unhappy working there. 'While looking for a table, the tables were dirty and  I had to clean a table to sit there.
It was a disappointing experience. I guess I expected so much more since Jay Cutler was the one to recommend this spot.This place had some great reviews so I figured I would give the buffet a try. I was really not impressed. First impressions were good in the door, it is nicely decorated and clean. We got there about 7 minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops. We enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, rice and the naan bread, but everything else was pretty disappointing. I was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit, most indian buffets I go to at least have rice pudding. We ordered mango lassis as well because they didnt have cold chais...which didnt really taste like mango, they were like white, sour, runny greek yogurt drinks. Honestly, I will not go back, there are much better places in town, perhaps sit down is a better experience.There is nothing exciting about a stale corporate version of Taste of Tops. They have the same beers and are much more expensive than Taste of Tops. Guess the rent on Mill Ave is a lot more than on University a couple of blocks away.  Loud and horrendously bad music doesn't help either.  No food but you can call the local restaurants for delivery, but this is a problem because when the delivery people get there they have no idea on who ordered the food and you can't hear your phone ring so the delivery people just wander around aimlessly.. Also you have Mill Ave parking issues to deal with. They do have a lot of beers to choose from but so does Tops down the street.  My advice, save your wallet and your ears and go to Tops down the street instead.We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. 

The decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.

When I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.

We ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.

Bottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.

Parent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom.The server for our party of 8 left quite a bitter taste in my mouth, Despite her attitude and her general lack of f***'s given, I'd say the food was great. I had pork belly on bed of arugula and a heavenly nut/grain salad that made up for being forced to talk to her scowling face. Why work in the service industry if you insist on making customers feel like they are a massive waste of your time? Lucky for her, the people I went with had class and held it together for the special occasion. 

Honestly, how annoying. 

If I did live in Arizona, I would not go back.Say no to the "IPA"-tastes like Corona!I have a love hate relationship with this place. It's tough to write a review of that. 

It's the closest place to my place of work that's open before 7am so it has that. I like The Coffee Shop at Agritopia because they're cheaper and yummier but I gotta be at work by 7am. Ugh. So here I go.

I will tell you the couple that owns this place are VERY VERY NICE. I like that. I like the looks of the inside, but there's no one there ever. That's sad. But they're nice. The God vibe (lots of church people go here) isn't overpowering for people who don't dig that.

But here are the flaws. There's a barista guy who has dark hair and a goatee who doesn't welcome customers. Twice in a week I went in and was #2 in line. He ignored me. Then people came in behind me and he literally took them before me! I was furious. I've since seen him again and he seems to try to be nice now, but it was very annoying.

Now I have tried 6 drinks in here since July, and I don't like any of them. The pre-med is a good idea but there's a weird taste to it. Ice Mocha, Toddy, everything, has a weird taste. I will keep coming back SEARCHING for a yummy something. I have never eaten here though. Also, costs too much money.Love the concept. This location has vacuums and compressed air stations to help you out after the wash. The customer service here is top notch. Seems to be the same core crew of young men and women. This was an old Danny's Family store. Unfortunately I think they may have just refurbished the existing wash system to make it their own. This wash just does not get your vehicle clean. If you're there to wash away a bit of dust I think it's fine. However, if your vehicle is 'dirty', good luck. Several times I've had to ask to go back through. Also I've noticed an ongoing issue with the compressed air nozzles spitting out a greasy residue. I brought it to an employees attention and they said it would be addressed. On a recent trip the greasy haze was still coming out of the nozzle. Purge and clean the air system? Here's to hoping the owner can address these issues. I really want to like this place. But at this point unless something changes, once my gift card is used up I won't be back.The noise at lunch here left the most distinctive impression on me so I guess the food was good.  I had the arugula salad and a less than flavorful iced tea.  Everyone else enjoyed their food but we all had to shout at each other in order to be heard.  The best part of my experience was leaving.  Come when it's quiet and you might enjoy it more.First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.This show was just ok.  Basically all circus acts that I've seen many times before. There was a trapeze act, juggling, tightrope, gymnasts, and some comedy.  I've seen a few other Cirque shows and this was by far the worst.  Nothing special at all.  I was amazed by the lady who created the sand art.  She was amazing.  I was able to get this show at bogo by playing the myvegas game but it was still 140 for one ticket.  I recommend seeing Le Reve or Mystere any day over this.I generally avoid bars inside casinos...I was certainly into the Public House when they opened though.  They had excellent beer, great screens for viewing, lots of solid food options, and an incredible staff.  ...Fast-forward.  My last couple of experiences have fallen flat.  Specifically the food is not at the same standard, and the service since has been either understaffed or inconsistent.the service was great, the deal was good, the food tasted okay but I was sick for two days after eating here. thats about as much as I can handle at the thought of this placeFirst review on Yelp! 

I used to live right next to the Great Dane in Fitchburg and also have always gone to the Great Dane downtown. When I did live next to the restaurant I ate there 2-3 times a week. (about a year and a half ago) since I moved I always craved their burgers. Recently went back for the first time since and I was deeply disappointing. I rarely eat in since I am never at home I like to eat at my house. I got the Dane burger and all of it was sad. (did not even finish my food) First off I loved their old eco-friendly fiber to-go boxes since they sucked in the condensation and did not make my fries and burger bun soggy. Even tho with the fries soggy they were still good as always. Next my burger was not the same as before seemed like it was half the size and was overcooked. The bun it came with was different then before: stale, huge and gross. On top of everything the lettuce that was on my burger... rotten.

Grew up in the restaurant industry and the quality of this restaurant just went down.Excited to give the House another try since their opening. Our welcome consisted of not being offered the open "champagne" at the front door, because it was not busy enough to warrant a splash. However, there were no outside seating available, yet open tables were visible. 

The appeal of the bar drew us in and we enjoyed a great glass of wine, beer and appetizer.   (Side note) we asked the sophisticated couple next to us their suggestion and all they could say was, food great and cold. Aware that the enjoyable coveted outside seating was not available we decided to order our entree at the bar. ( it is the "House" and dinners are made to be shared) we ordered the Tradori chicken.   Unfortunately, we were denied once again because they only a have certain amount of food for the restaurant and would not allow us to order entrees at the bar.  Needless to say we went to the other less pretentious "House" Eddies.  Bon appetiteCafe rio has great food, but they can never seem to get my order right when I place it through the phone. They don't listen to your specifications and when I ask for extra of anything, they charge but don't provide. I let the manager know that this was the third time they had made my order incorrectly, but she only offered to remake it, when I had told her I was in a rush, hence why I placed the order over the phone. My coworkers also complained that theirs were made incorrectly. You would think they would comp you a meal or something of the sort rather than trying to make you wait for something that should've been made right the first time. If their food didn't taste so good, when made correctly, I probably would not return or recommend it to anyone else.
They definitely have poor management.Was at Target and then had an appointment, so with time to kill, thought I'd treat myself to lunch.

Nice place.  Bright, clean, well-decorated.

Service through-out was very good, if not warm and fuzzy.  Although I seated myself, I had a menu within moments, ice tea came promptly and was kept filled.  Server checked in twice to see if there was anything else I needed.  If there was a service problem before, it's been rectified.

Food: I ordered a chicken gyro and upped to onion rings for 99 cents.  Maybe a bad choice---I can't help but compare what I had at the Summit with the gyros from Greek Pita at Happy Valley.  All I could think was GFS (that's Gordon Food Service)  The chicken was plentiful on the nicely grilled pita, but there was nothing Greek about it.  It tasted like an anonymous herbed chicken breast that comes in a 10 lb bag.  It was okay.  It's probably the same anonymous chicken breast they use for a couple of dishes.  About a tablespoon of small dice tomatoes and two (I counted) slivers of red onion.  The tzatziki came in one of those little lidded plastic cups and if it had any flavor, I could not discern it.  The onion rings were definitely out of a GFS or Costco freezer.  But they were crisply fried and not greasy.  But for flavor and satisfaction, I'd give it a two.  Quantity of food: a 5.

If the level of food had matched the service and cute decor, this place would have been a winner and on my list.  But as it is...  Waaay over priced at $9.99 for the gyro and then the upcharge for the onion rings.  (Lunch for one person was fifteen bucks and some change)  But for that kind of lunch money, I want food that's been prepared for me, not defrosted.  Like I said, I am a fan of Greek Pita and you can't compare what you get from GP for 5.95 to the Summit gyro.

However, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Maybe ordering Greek at a Scottsdale "diner" is akin to ordering Italian at Applebees.  You deserve what you get.  

I might try it again, if its the right time and place---maybe another menu item would be better.  I'll let you all know....We walked in for a lunch on Sunday. It happened to be the World Cup and I was surprised that there was availability, but there was. 

We were seated in the bar area and our drinks and appetizers were ordered. This was great and that is where it ended. 

Once our appetizers were ordered our waitress decided to become engrossed doing other things. When she finally did come by we ordered and then we waited for over 30 minutes (easily). When we did get our food the plate was hot but the food was cold. Go figure. 

As far as the food went, it was average. Not bad. However, coupled with that kind of service, no way will I be back.Soot on my pizza, a register Chickie who is too young to serve a beer...

I stopped for a slice...great prices...good sauce...outstanding crust and toppings...BUT YOU GOT SOOT ON MY CHEESE!

Because of your airport location and the number of people always in line, as well as my getting the slice to go so I had something to eat on the plane, I was unable to take the slice back and show it to someone who could do something about it.

Your prices are very fair, your pizza certainly has potential...anything you can do to educate the person who got soot on my pizza will help.

Yer gonna save yourself a WHOLE lot of time and gain more customers if you get someone old enough to pour a beer to run the register.  That way, the folks who order a beer can pay, get their beer and receipt and clear the register to help the next customer.  Having to wait while the cashier gets someone old enough to pull a beer is not an effective use of time or personnel...WHO: Those of you curious about them MEATBALLS! 

WHEN: Not too sure about the time range they are open. Their website says they are open for breakfast, lunch, and late dining.

WHERE: Located inside Townsquare, right beside the AMC theater.

WHAT: Going to and from the theater, this spot always seemed to catch my eye. So, one night after a movie, my friend and I decided to check it out. My friend had already gone here once, but she hadn't tried the meatballs... so... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! 

We walked in knowing we were going to try the meatballs. While looking at the menu, I noticed they were actually pretty pricey. $9.99 for 3 regular sized meatballs and your choice of sauce on top. We decided to try the meatball sampler (6 meatballs for $17.99) with parmesan cream on top... 

Conclusion.
Not any of the 6 meatballs positively caught my taste buds =(. NO BUENO!It gets the job done.  What do you want, it's a Sbarro's.  

If you want something that's different than the traditional pizza, try a stromboli.  Unlike pizza, it's .... okay, it's basically tubular pizza.  But it's good!

My only beef with Sbarro's is really a beef with the food court it's part of:  The iced tea they serve at the fountain is UNDRINKABLE.  I'm taking off a star for it.  I actually had to pour my tea out and drink water, it was so vile.  There were two fountains, and I tried the tea in both places, and it was equally horrible out of both fountains. 

In an era in which even Jack in the Box manages to serve excellent iced tea, you need to up your game, Sbarro's Food Court!I loved the Garden and I loved all the friendly people who waited on us.   I am sorry but I did not like the food.  I had Natural Chicken which was really a Cornish Hen which I do not like to eat.  It was not tender.  The Mashed ( pureed ) potatoes were good.  I liked the Brussel Sprouts but I like mine a little more cooked.  The coffee was good, the wait time was long.Small tacos, high prices, and dumb policies.... Trying reeeeal hard to be nice and give them that second star.

I was here a few months ago but drunk out of my mind and I couldn't have written my Yelp-worthy review based on my tipsy experience. I decided to stop by the other day and I guess you have to be drunk to really appreciate this place.

Located off Flamingo and Rainbow, Pepe's is a 24 hour taco/Mexican fast food spot in the same vein as Robertos. They have about 6 or 7 different types of meat for their tacos along with plenty of burritos, combo plates, and other standard Mexican offerings.

The tacos were small and at about two bucks a pop definitely not worth it. They only use one small corn tortilla so everything gets soggy and falls out on the plate. =( booo! The carne asada was lacking in flavor and a little dry, likewise the chorizo was nothing memorable. The salsa bar was a disaster when we came in. The two watery sauces they had were splashed all over the place added little flavor to the tacos. 

What really disappointed me about Pepe's were their stupid policies. 50 cents charge for using a credit card, 30 minute limit for eating-in and they even had the nerve to post  sign on the soda fountain about extra charges if you are caught sharing a drink. All these rules and fees make eating their mediocre food more of a hassle than it should be.

If you are looking for an authentic tacos hit up Tacos El Gordo, better tacos, cheaper prices, no stupid rules.This is a good, convenient location and has great deals on sodas and coffees. They also have a good automatic car wash available and discounts on the wash if you buy gas.

The down side is that this location is a nightmare to navigate. The parking lot is always congested and is poorly set up, it is hard to find parking, and when you get in the store is crowded and hard to move around in. This location needs a serious remodel in my opinion.Sorry Gordon but English pub food is for wankers. You don't serve Breakfast and the music is too loud for a Sunday at noon. Get rid of those high top tables also in front or tell your hostess not to seat people there that early in the day.  The lamb burger is a big gooey mess with that goat cheese. Your fries could be a little more crispy too .I was informed of this place (also called The Hop Stop) when I was given a menu while I was attending Glendale Glitters. I was initially very interested in eating there because they had clam chowder in a bread bowl, my ultimate favorite food. About a month or so later my boyfriend and I decided to go for a bite here since we live right down the street. It was bad from the start... When the waitress was taking our drink orders I asked for a Dr. Pepper which she didn't even know if they had and had to check in the back (which they didn't). Then comes the food order and of course I asked for the clam chowder which they didn't have either... So I decided to go with the strawberry salad instead and guess what? No strawberries. So I half-heartedly ordered the tortilla soup in the bread bowl and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ burger without onions. The soup was okay... It could've used salt which wasn't available at the table and our waitress was nowhere to be found, and my boyfriends burger came with a ton of onions.... It's a cute place but we were definitely disappointed and won't be coming back.I used to hit this spot for my pho cravings since its super convienent to mi casa. It has now been taken over and things have changed but not for the better. i went for the Pad Thai since it is usually a good test for me to determine if i will be back again. It was ok...nothing that knocked me off my feet which of course saddened my Thai loving heart.

Pho Ao Sen, I'm not sure what happened but i Miss you and wish you didn't leave.Got a Cole Turkey and the Bobbie, because they roast their own turkeys in house, and The turkey meat itself was pretty good - the problem is that they drenched the turkey in so much mayo and Russian dressing and then the coleslaw had a lot of mayo in it, I had to pull out just the meat and actually dry the meat off

The amount of fat in the mayo, russian dressing, and coleslaw was insane I could feel my heart slowing looking at it,. after a couple paper towels of wipe down - there was very little actual meat on the sandwich (a medium) and it was mainly bread and sauce 

The bread was nothing special - this turned out to be highly disappointing, they certainly are not the best sandwich shop on the block much less the country

The Bobbie was also drenched in mayo but less so, and that one had more meat was better put together and the Mrs liked it

The cookies were just ok to me however the Mrs enjoyed the sugar one quite a bit 

Unlikely we will be back, if we ever do we will certainly ask for all sauces on the side

It is a shame because they have good quality turkey meat pulled from a real turkey and hide it with bad bread and sauces, sometimes less is moreNothing here stands out and makes me want to go again. 

It wasn't that far out of what Red, White, and Blue had to offer. 

This place is NOT vegetarian friendly. The chef was nice enough to make our party specialty items (off menu) to satisfy. 

I ordered a flat iron steak. It wasn't bad, but this also isn't a steak house - it's like an upscale cafe....maybe. 

I did really like the beer selection! Although no beers are on tap, all bottled.Can do way better. Service sucks. Definitely needs to be cleaned up way more. It's pretty ghetto, here. Definitely don't gamble hereEveryone seems to have the same comment about this place... "You get what you pay for". 

My best friend and I went during the week and stayed here for 2 days. We upgraded and still only paid $35/night... but that's about the only good thing about the stay. 

To start off on a positive note, they let us check in at 10:30 when normal check-in wasn't until 4, so that was EXTREMELY helpful. The front desk and bell hop were all very nice, as well as the valet. Room service wasn't available the ONE time I had called, so we didn't call again during the visit. The runner was on lunch so he was unable to provide room service for one hour. In our minds, if you have someone go on lunch, HAVE SOMEONE ELSE COVER HIM!! 

The room was VERY basic. Very old, paint was chipping on the dresser and nightstand. The door to the balcony was broken. Though it was nice to have a balcony, there's an outdoor club of some sort that was outside of our window that was going until 4am every night. It was completely obnoxious to the people staying at the hotel.

Our bathroom had good lighting, and the shower was clean and nice. The downside to the bathroom is that our toilet didn't have a lid. We thought that was pretty unsanitary. 

The elevators were DISGUSTING. Made me not want to go back up to my hotel room just because I didn't want to take the elevator! They were EXTREMELY dirty and smelt like pee. You would HOPE someone walked in there with WAY too much perfume or cologne on so that it masked the smell of a bum.

All 3 days we were seeing advertisements to the restaurant they have called "Quesadilla" and so on the third day we decided to go, when we got up to the 5th floor the restaurant WAS CLOSED. It was 4pm on a Wednesday! 

Checkout was VERY easy, all we had to do was leave our room keys in the room, so that was nice.

Overall, a very awful hotel. I think that this hotel has potential (for the price) when it's done, but plain and simple it should NOT be open yet!Good beer list, but the menu and service are poor at best.Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great. 

When we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.

Pro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.

The rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it.I have mixed feelings about Halo... On one hand, I got my puppy here and he is a good dog, but on the other, our actual experience was not very good. We went one day to look at dogs with the thought that we might adopt. They have a lot of dogs here and the conditions aren't wonderful. A lot of the dogs are in indoor/outdoor cages that were very dirty when we went. The dogs kept indoors were 3-4 per cage. We filled out the paperwork to meet some of the dogs we had seen and handed them to the man at the counter. Then we preceded to wait....and wait....and wait. Not wanting to be impatient, I finally went up to ask how much longer it would be. Oh, they lost my paperwork. Great. We refilled out the paperwork and finally got taken back to see the dogs. The people who work/volunteer here weren't very knowledgeable, but helped as much as they could. We found a dog that would be a good match and his adoption fee was 185$... a lot more than the Humane Society. I understand, but it seemed a little steep. We took our pup home and fed him the food they sent home with us. He wouldn't eat. He wouldn't eat for a week. We thought maybe it was an adjustment period. That is until we fed him a different food and he ate it all. How long had he been at the shelter refusing to eat? I know he had been there at least a week. That just made me sad. Additionally, unlike the Humane Society, Halo does not include a vet visit with adoption, so that is unfortunate, as many animals do have initial medical needs. I don't know that I would adopt here again, but I did get a good pup and am thankful for finding him.


PS The dog was listed as black and white and indeed looked that way....that is until we washed him and he turned out to be brown and white.... would've been nice if they rinsed these poor dogs off. Just a thought.I work in this area every Friday, and every Friday I go to Paradise Bakery or the new Wildflower location for a salad. I decided to try Which Wich to break out of my routine.

I shouldn't have.

It wasn't the unique way to order your sandwich (on a preprinted paper bag), it wasn't the 15 minute wait to get my sandwich, it wasn't the employees...it was the sandwich.

Now, let me say, the bread that my sandwich was on was excellent! It was soft and chewy and crusty...GREAT bread! And the quality of the meat (I had turkey) was phenomenal! But...I needed my glasses to actually FIND the meat! Literally had to go searching for it. I also ordered avocado (for an extra charge) on my sandwich, and it was a spread, not slices. The caramelized onions I had added were tough and unpleasant as well, and the 'spicy' mayo was absent. I was more than a little disappointed.

I paid $10.18 for a 7 inch sandwich, chips and a drink. I usually pay a little under $10.00 for my salad from Paradise or Wildflower, and I take half home. I was expecting so much more from Which Wich, and received so much less.

I'll stick to my usual lunch spots.Be glad you got two stars...it definitely was NOT for the service, the waiter, or the portions.  We were really excited to try this place...we had been fans of Dillons and the countless other restaurants in this spot and went with an open mind.  First off, it was noon on Monday and there were only two other tables with customers.  It took forever for service, our waiter was not helpful, in fact, we ordered our appetizer and he assumed we'd want it with our lunch (you know what they say about when you ASS-UME).  We had to ask for silverware - he brought out two of the lunches and did not return with the other two.  He finally brought out one more and totally spaced the fourth.  The portion...another ASSUMption.  My friends did not order lunch portions, they ordered off the regular menu and when we questioned we were told the computer ASSUMES you want lunch.  Communication, caring, personality would have made this such a better experience especially since we live nearby and would love to frequent the place.  Have to say, the food was good.  I LOVED my appetizer,  which came eventually.I usually don't write bad reviews, but I was very disappointed with the food and service here! My husband and I came here last night (Monday) around 8:00 before going to see Mystere.  I ordered the classic hamburger with cheese (for $16) and their $5 special margarita. The burger was VERY bland! It was under seasoned and overcooked. The margarita was ok. It was worth $5. My husband said his Philly cheese steak sandwich was good, but he ordered a coke which he never received until after he got his food because the waitress forgot. After we got our food the waitress never came back to the table and my husband needed a refill on his coke. We had both finished our food before she came back to the table and my husband had to ask for the refill and for the check. She never apologized for not refilling his coke sooner, just acted flustered when my husband asked for it. Btw, this was not a busy Monday night. When she came back, she refilled his coke and put the check on the table. And the coke was flat. Like it literally tasted like watered down syrup. I thought for sure she would have taken the coke off the bill, but she didn't. AND the coke was $3.75!!! I feel like we would have had better food and service for a cheaper price at Denny's! I guess we should have said something, but I hate complaining when I just want to have an enjoyable time. I understand that we ate at one of the "cheaper" places in Treasure Island, but for a $16 burger I felt like it should have tasted better than what you would get at a hospital cafeteria. And for a coke that cost $3.75, it should have been refilled when we still had our food, and not flat! And for a $45 overall bill, the waitress should have at least been friendly. We didn't tip and I ALWAYS tip even if the experience isn't that great, as long as the servers are nice and food is ok. I would have tipped if the coke had been taken off the bill. Also, as we were walking away from the table we saw the bus boy counting out the money we left right there at the table in front of all the other guests! Like taking it out and counting it out on the table! Seriously? Not what I expected from a restaurant in Treasure Island. They need to step it up!Basically it's the old Centurion tower at Caesar's Palace.  The place just opened not too long ago but it seems like they did mostly cosmetic upgrades.  The rooms were of standard size in that price range. 

The room is pretty simply decorated and gives a more zen feeling which is expected for a Japanese inspired hotel.  The room still smelled of paint and was quite dusty.  For the room we got, there were some problems with the thermostat in that it wasn't working.  Plus the engineer that came by at 4am to try to fix this problem said that he didn't think they changed the windows neither, and that's why there's a small draft coming into the room from the outside as well.  It took  2 hours to get some extra blankets.  These are the reasons why my thought is that they only did cosmetic upgrades.  None of the internals, HVAC, electrical plumbing upgrades were done.

When we were checking out, we complained to the front desk about the problems since they even took the room off the market since they knew it was having major problems that they wouldn't want to have other paying customers face.  We spoke to the receptionist and they said that a manager would call the cell phone number on that account.  Never got the phone call and this was at 2pm.  When we left the hotel later, 11pm, we told them that the manager never called.  Got stuck there for another hour, couldn't get a refund and their compensation was that we could book a bigger suite the next time we come at the cheapest room rate.   I would have just preferred to stay at Encore like I normally do, but wanted to give them a try since I love Nobu's food so much.  Not too happy about the customer service that never seems to lack at any of the Nobu Matsuhisa restaurants.  Extremely disappointed.It was good of the owner to comment on my post. They mentioned we stayed for another hour....yes waiting for our next beer and an order of putine for my brother. I did have to hunt the manager/owner(?) down. She did not find me. I understand they were slammed. We were polite and tried to have a good time anyway. The beer and putine were eventually served after I actually went BACK to the owner and complained after a LONG wait (during which our beers weren't served to us). I don't hold any ill will against the establishment, but I won't be returning. I WILL also tell of my experience.Goodness gracious ! 

Getting in was not a problem, in fact we were lucky to be comped 2 bottles and placed right next to deadmau5 dj arena! We drank the two bottles and were getting shimmy to the left and then eventually other people took over. 
I later was accused by a bartender who i earlier had complimented on how nice she looked (which i never do) ! She blamed me for being the girl she told apparently 3 x not to sit at a certain area of the table! 

I was than kicked out of the table and i pulled the rest of the girls with me! It was soo annoying! 

On top of that they over pact the club so going to the restroom alone, was as if we were in a sardine can, it was just plane terrible!Ugh... cramped quarters with the bizarre pool table room, hip hop room and large DJ area. Came to see Tiesto and maybe it was the crowd with a few serious douchebags... Tiesto killed it though so props to him. Probably wouldn't be back unless it was to see Calvin Harris. Hopefully they can make some changes on capacity and $9 for a mini bottle of Fiji. Meh overallSalads are good - but everything is very expensive and the manager treats the employees like dirt.  I've seen it first hand multiple times.I stopped in to this location with a co-worker for a bite during lunch.  Always on the lookout for good sushi, we decided to give this place a try.  The results were less than stellar.

We both felt the service lacked somewhat.  Not on the server side, but on the food delivery side.  We both felt the service was sort of slow, despite the restaurant being mostly empty.

I ordered smoked salmon nigiri, seared tuna tataki salad and a baked scallop roll.  The Tuna salad was large, but seemed to be doused in a lot of sauce that was sort of vinegar-like.  It was too much for me.  Additionally, the tuna was brown with visible white connective tissue veins.  I did not finish this dish.  

The baked scallop roll was one of the lessor examples of the dish I have had.  Using what appeared to be regular US-style mayo, straight, and little, if any additives made for a roll that any untrained person could execute at home without any flair or problem.

On the flip side, the smoked salmon nigiri was tasty and well portioned.

I also ordered a desert I had never heard of, tempura or deep fried cheese cake.  This peaked my interest and I explored.  Once delivered, it dawned on me that I was looking at a close cousin of a churro drizzled with chocolate sauce and whipped cream (see a photo I have posted).  It was initially tasty, but lost its attractiveness as I consumed more.  It's high sweetness load, combined with the outer "fried" layer made for a bad finish.  This is a desert that would probably appeal more to children at a party.

Overall, not my best sushi experience, but not my worst.  Since I always believe that everyone has a bad day, I will keep this one on my second chance list.I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place for $45 for two hours of cleaning. I know I didn't specifically request deep cleaning but I really wonder what the hell the girl was doing for two hours. I recently moved out of a house and called on these people to do a move out clean. I figured with no furniture and nothing to dust, it wouldn't take that long to clean the kitchen and bathrooms. I didn't go inside to inspect the house until after the girl left but when I did, I was sorely disappointed. First off, she was 45 minutes late (okay, I get that things happen, but at least give me a call so I'm not sitting there waiting). Secondly, the bathroom cleaning was a joke. The microwave wasn't cleaned. The ceiling fans weren't cleaned. I mean I think she just cleaned the floors and vacuumed. She maybe ran a dust cloth over the counters. It was a joke. I've vacuumed my house before and it takes a total of 20 minutes...MAYBE 30 minutes. I have no idea what this chick was doing for 2 hours but I know I'll never call them again. 

The thing is, I told the people when I scheduled that I was moving out and obviously I understand I only paid for 2 hours and didn't necessarily expect it to be in 2 hours so I was prepared to pay the difference. I'm irritated that I bought this deal. I should've known better and just paid full price to get it done. Now I have to go back and clean up. Beyond annoyed with these people. 

They get +1 star because they have an automated email that confirms your appointment...but it doesn't matter because she'll show up late anyway.We were very excited to have a new steakhouse in the neighborhood that excitement quickly subsided when we sat down and began to turn to dread when it took our server 15 minutes to make it to our table and when she was there her mind was elsewhere she seemed distracted and it then became evident when our MEDIUM steaks showed up bloody rare! I mean they were mooing. We informed her and it seemed like sending them back was a total inconvenience. If your gonna go out and spend the money on a good steak just go to Flemings or even Outback for that matter. The 2 stars are basically for the friendly bartender we had, we shoulda just ate at the bar when she asked us.I have been eating here since the late 90's when I was in college. I watched them grow from one small room to two. I was so excited to try their new location. I came in after work alone on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I was excited to see the great beer selection. I ordered a vanilla porter. It was quite tasty. It took awhile to put a food order in but the food came out pretty fast. I had the orange chicken and a teriyaki egg roll. Both where very good. My beer was gone by this point and I was never offered water. I sat and sat and sat and sat with zero service. My bartender a female with sunglasses on her head ignored me and the only other guy sitting on the one side of the bar. A bartender asked him eventually what he wanted but
Didnt acknowledge me. Finally the female bartender asked if I wanted another beer I said no just a to go container and my tab. I am seriously disappointed. So my one piece of advice is call in a to go and pick it up yourself. Don't waster your time with the terrible customer service!!  Ug. Terrible!!New Revolving sushi in town and a Groupon for it. . . . SOLD! After buying this Groupon deal online we came here last night for dinner. The decor and style of the restaurant was very hip and colorful. The layout of the establishment was horrible. If you were sitting in the inner bar and wanted to use the restroom. You had to walk all the way around and over, Just to get to it. 

The service was awesome; friendly and helpful. Thank you, Carlos.  

The food: Let's just say I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and fried rice more than the sushi. The sushi was very SMALL portioned and bland - I've been to many revolving sushi establishments around town and never seen/had such a small amount of sushi on a plate for the same price.

PS if it hadn't been for the great service, this place would have gotten a one star.Time to update the reviews on this place. Me and wife wanted some sushi again, we showed up..glad to see the place was packed and looks like its doing really well for itself.

Something has somewhat changed here. The decor still rocks, but the atmosphere seems some what lacking. 

Customer Service: seemed to have slipped here, as with so many patrons that it looks disorganized with 3 people cleaning and resetting a table when there are customers who are waiting for orders or drink refills such as I was. 

We also ordered off the menu and it took nearly 15 minutes to bring out half and we never received an avocado roll that was ordered which we waited for 30 minutes for. Our waiter also disappeared for a little bit and none of the other waiters were able to fill his role or help out with the table. 

Also one last thing that the workers all seemed unhappy and gave a weird unwelcoming vibe.

Food Quality Does not match pricing any more:
They also seemed to have raised the prices now to the point where they are trying to match higher end restaurants. Such as the unagi which I can get for $4-$6 for about 4 pieces here its $4 for a plate for 3 in small sizes. There are hardly any $1 white places and my wife loves avocado rolls which there are none to be seen. 

I hope they get their act together soon and reestablish the values it had when it first opened, as me and wife had previously enjoyed this place.Well they gave us bacon instead of Canadian bacon. Bad start to new place.Its kinda loud for my taste, but their drinks are good and so is the food. 
FYI...Portions aren't great so if you got a healthy appetite, this ain't the place for you! Caveat: the chips and salsa are fresh and somewhat filling. A possible solution to the small portions? You decide.
I think they've got an interesting location, and a building with great possibilities. I think they haven't quite hit their stride yet.
I'll keep checking in to see what gives.this place was a fun,  cheap food, cheap drinks,  fun games.   unfortunately we had to leave because our friend was denied entry.   he committed the blasphemous sin of wearing so called ''athletic sandals'' instead of flip flops.  at least,  that's the distinction the bouncer made sure to make so that we understood clearly his rational for standing his ground against the evil athletic sandals.  i'm just thankful my friend wasn't arrested for such offensive behavior.   i mean,  footwear is a number one priority in 100 degree heat.  so just make sure to call ahead and send several snap shots of your foot apparel over for approval before trying to play skeeball.   they don't play here.  oh,  and be sure not to close the door to the patio.   you'll be looked out and the bros on their cellphones will be too cool to hear you banging o the door for help.If you're a fan of Michael Jackson, you'll enjoy the show.  They preformed a wide variety of his music with some nice visualizes.

If you're like me and a fan of Cirque du Soleil, skip this one.  This show was seriously lacking in the acrobatic, strength, and balance displaces that are associated with that name.  It is almost completely a song and dance show.BUST!!! Everyone is over hyping this place. Anyone who says this place is good doesn't know what they're talking about~~~~
I gave this place 2 tries to change my mind or even possibly improve on their product but I was wrong both times; I was unsatisfied with what they were serving "fluff" or "snow cream" ice. 
Before coming to this place I tried two places "Frostbites Shavery (now called Snowflakes Shavery)" and "The Little Kitchen Cafe" both places serve what I think it suppose to be real fluff ice. Kuma tastes nothing like the real thing. I'm not saying I'm an expert on fluff ice or snow cream but I know what taste bad. Kuma's product is very grainy and more equivalent to frozen yogurt. The toppings provided aren't even fresh and the combinations given don't even sound appetizing. The only positive thing about this place is the branding of the company.My fiancé and I only came here because it was the only thing available at the time. No matter where I go, I always keep an open mind, especially at 130am. 

We were seated, went over the menu and I had a couple questions for our waitress. I asked if they could make a tuna sandwich instead of turkey. No, as we don't have tuna in the kitchen. Okay, that's fine. 

I kept on looking and saw a nacho appetizer. Awesome, I love nachos with some added chicken for protein. Joked with my fiancé saying she would say no again. I went ahead and asked, again, as I predicted, she said no. Not because there was no chicken in their kitchen, it was simply because they couldn't; didn't want to. 

I was already in a very shitty mood and had a blt sandwich. It was mediocre. 

In a city that has everything, this place in particular does not have the option to personalize. 

Anyone else that is looking for them to accommodate their simple food requests, go somewhere else. This place WILL NOT!I really wanted to love this place, but it wasn't great. We stopped hear before we saw Boys II Men at the Mirage for dinner. I had dirty burps all night, which has never happened to me. I love Italian food, and this was a disappointment. Go to Battista's Hole in the Wall instead, trust me.So you know when you hear those excessive ads on the radio it'll get to you sooner or later. My roommate and I ventured here and we were clearly in Ravens territory. It's a casual joint with TVs and a bar that opens out to the patio as well. I'm a seafood lover and was really excited to try everything. We started with 2 dozen happy hour oysters priced at $1 a piece. That was refreshing. Then we ordered bacon wrapped scallops in which you can't go wrong with that. Their crabs and clams were just "ok" maybe because it's not in season. The size of the seafood items were rather small. However, their crab cakes were decent. Overall, we weren't impressed with the food. Food quality price ratio is definitely not great our bill came close to $90.Uh, I was expecting something like Curry House back home in Hawaii, especially considering the decor looked like a downgraded version, but I was awfully disappointed. I had the curry udon with chicken karage and the portions were pretty small, for the price you pay definitely not worth it. The chicken karage also tasted funny. All in all, I probably would not come back.St James Centre is always busy.  At least, that's how it feels whenever I'm there.  It's busy and filled with loads of mediocre shops that I pass by without even noting, on my way to John Lewis.

In my opinion, John Lewis is just about the only redeemable shop in the St James Centre, and its location right next to Multrees Walk, Edinburgh's poshest shopping street, is bizarre.  

To be fair, the fact that it seems always busy here (especially when it's raining - NEVER COME HERE WHEN IT'S RAINING) certainly indicates that I am in the minority in my opinion and if you like Dorthy Perkins and Next and the rest, then it's absolutely convenient to have them available in the city centre instead of having to trek out to Ocean Terminal or that place near Sighthill.  Having said that, the spaces for these stores is quite small which means that everything it jammed in and quite tight.

So no, not a place for me, but certainly a place I pass through on a regular basis.We are Las Vegas locals and have tried nearly every steak house in the valley.  We were excited to try Heritage Steak due its convenient location as we were seeing a show that night at the Mirage.  We were greeted cordially by three female greeters that were dressed professionally and were promptly seated.  The section we were in was moderately busy but not bustling.  The visual ambience was very nice architecturally and was warm and inviting.  The background music was too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation over it.  The cooks/chefs were wearing baseball caps, which really detracted from the elegance of the restaurant.  Once we were seated, we were given the choice of bottle water or house water.  The water was served promptly.  Unfortunately we were not greeted by our waiter for over 15 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar.  As we were getting up, our waiter swooped in and laid on numerous excuses as to why we were not greeted by him shortly after we were seated.  He assured us that we would have a fine dining experience and there was no reason for us to go sit at the bar.  We acquiesced and elected to allow him to serve us.  We ordered the surf and turf with a medium rare filet and onions rings.  The king crab was well prepared and the onion rings were very flavorful.  Our steak was overcooked to medium well and charred externally.  We informed the waiter that the steak was overcook and again he patronized us with excuses for the chefs.  He brought us a new steak that was prepared rare instead of medium rare but edible.  The seasonings on the steak were very well blended and flavorful and the texture and cut of the steak was average for a prime filet.  The waiter was quite transparent with his banter with us and it was somewhat awkward.  The manager never came and apologized for poorly cooked steak.  Overall, it is highly unlikely that we will be dining at this establishment again.Just got back. I had the grilled vegetable salad. It was small and didn't have enough dressing. The waitress didn't come back to see how everything was till we were done.  My friend had the grilled chicken. Nothing special. Kind if foo foo food. Not a big fan. Food was fair, service poor. Wont go back.Will give Echo & Rig another try because our steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and flavored. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par. We dined downstairs, early dinner. We watched as one couple left because there was no server in sight. When  one popped up, we seemed to haven disturb her. Took our order, no follow up, just the check.Read all the good reviews so I figured I would try it out.  I have tried the gyro:  overcooked and not very good, the chicken shwarama:  just plain old stuff and not very good, and the jalapeno hummus which was average but the pita with it was like cardboard - thin and stale.  No way is this place even an average Greek/Mediterranean place.Had a short break for work, so I decided while I'm in the Container Park I'll give this place a shot. Didn't have much time so I called ahead and placed an order for the Al Pastor Burrito. I arrived at Pinches Tacos 30-40 minutes later to find out my order was never made. Very disappointing. My food was ready about 10 minutes later. The burrito was decent sized, and came with a side order of tortilla chips. I think the situation warranted a free beer, but I was too hungry to complain. The burrito was pretty good! Definitely gets the job done while you're visiting the park. Prices are average, and the menu had a big selection. However, if you're looking for the best burritos in town, I highly recommend Cardenas.Boozery has a great view of the stage.  The drinks are pricy, for a gin & tonic, a screw driver and a Heffinwieter the cost was $27.00 that's in plastic cups and no garnishes.     Seems like either they are trying get rich on every drink or the overhead is way to much.    It's a shame it has great potential as a business. We will be back to container park for the food and music, just NOT for the Booz from Boozery!   Very pricy for what you get!  The beer at the BQ joint is cheaper.First time awesome.  Second time two weeks later not so good. Out of wine and changed the short ribs in a bad way.  We will go to grass roots next time.  Bummer had high hopes.There were definitely a few problems that were found here. Upon entering our room, every time there was this weird smell. It was either a clean smell or just a genuinely bizarre scent. Then, the wifi did not work well at all, the connection was slow and kept on cutting in and out. On our last night of three here, there emerged a leak from the ceiling of the bathroom. Overall, we did get a great deal on this place, and it was in a convenient location, but these problems did dampen our stay (literally).If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune.Good lunch or hang out spot for sure. Hipster approved. Had an order of fish tacos. Not so impressed. Very bland, nothing special. At almost $4 each for a "street taco" I would expect a bit more discovery in the taste bud area. However, the tortilla soup was great. Service on the other hand was mildly annoying. Three different employees came to our table during the meal. I'm not quite sure who was the server, the runner, the busser. The one I'm assuming was the server took our order, stopped by once and ...poof. Never saw the person again. We were left sitting with empty dishes and that we-need-to-get-back-to-work-look on our faces way too long. Everyone was nice, but the restaurant manager needs to tighten up the service process if one expects weekday/workday lunch crowd approval.I had high hopes that this place was on the same level as Salt River in feel and character but I sure did not have that after visiting it last night.  Maybe as I never have been at Wrigley I am missing some of the customized elements.

By far the biggest issue, minus the stupid prices for t-shirts and concessions, is the exceedingly poor scoreboard.  We sat in the lower level of the first base side and had a heck of a time reading the scoreboard.  Here are my gripes on the scoreboard:

Too small to be useful
At night it is not very well lighted so seeing the non-lighted sections is impossible
About 1/3 was being used for advertising
No stats provided for the batter (take a lesson from Salt River)
The line up on the left side did not highlight the batter but with the letters so small it would not be of much use.

By the way the parking lot lighting but there was no signage as to how to exit and the entrance was blocked off!  

I never have been to a ballpark above a crude kids field that did not have the distances from home plate to the outfield fence shown with signs hanging on the fence.My G/F and I went here after reading reviews I have to say it's just another disappointment in an expensive steak. The wait staff was attentive but our particular waitress didn't seem to knowledgable about the menu. She was fumbling and just had to think a lot about certain ?s I asked. In a place like this the service should be professional and top notch. It simply was not in our case. 

Also the steak I was wanting they were already out of for the night. I hoped to order the dry aged ribeye. But I had to settle for the bone in ribeye that is not dry aged. When it came out it honestly was a little tough even though being ordered med rare not at all what I expected for a $60 steak. It just was blah really did not have much flavor to it at all. It was really a shame because I think I could do better at home on my grill. 

We also had crab cakes which were tasty and grilled asparagus which didn't have much flavor either. Loaded baked potatoe was pretty good. Lava cake for dessert was good also. 

With 1 glass of wine and tip our bill came to $175. Considering I didn't get the steak I asked for the least I thought they could do was comp and app. Or a glass of wine for us. Just an expensive chain restaraunt I don't see what all the fuss is about. 

We honestly could have had a better meal at a place in southern highlands called Off the strip. They steak was about the same quality I could have gotten there for 40% less $$ the sides are just as good. The same meal there prob would be under $100 for the 2 of us. No one came around asking how is the food. I really should have sent the steak back and gotten something else. The waitress just asked how it was cooked and if I needed anything else. Never suggested or offered any sauces. I cut into it and it looked fine just didn't have any flavor. If she had come back around I prob would have said something. Just saying for $175 I expected a lot better. Just call it like I see it...This place has an identity crisis and needs to decide who it is and fast - cafeteria or full serve ? gourmet or processed fast food pizza ? right now it's using "some" canned ingredients .(pineapple / tomatoes etc.) and "processed" (powdered parmesan etc.) toppings - they are displayed on shelves and I asked about them.  Also, the serving method is just bizarre - why walk your order up to a cashier and don't pay yet - you delivered everything else to my table including food - then... I end up paying at the table anyway ??

Such a nice restaurant and fine staff - decide who you are and pull the trigger - and please lower your prices if not fresh ingredients and sticking with the 1/3 cafeteria style ?? Such potential - a real shame really.Great location, great enough space, welcoming decor.... BUT...

Food didn't impress me..
I got bunless for I had given up bread for lent.. I got a Turkey Brunch (Turkey Burger with Fried Egg, Bacon, and American Cheese). Meat wasn't dry, but it wasn't moist.. I like my burgers to where a sauce would be extra flavoring. This burger NEEDED sauce, in my case, ketchup... Bacon had a weird taste to it. The egg wasn't to my liking, then again the waitress/cashier didn't really bother asking how I like my eggs.. I had to ask for lettuce on the side when my food came... Instead of being on my plate already because you order, pay THEN sit..

To also add that waitress messed up my coworker and I's orders..

Overall the place is just "ok"... I don't really care for it..Updated:  opened at 10:00 and a sidewalk sign was placed in front of the unmarked ticket window that faced west only. 

Lots of details yet to be worked. 

Review:

Gave it two stars because it looks great. 
Did not get the experience they failed to open as advertised. 

Came to do the Linq, seems they are not ready for prime time. At 9:30 am being worked on and not open to public as advertised. 

  Signage could use some work as well, ticket office is about 100 ft west of wheel. People will need more guidance for parking and for reaching the office. 

Also, the hours are not posted on the door of the ticket office of the entrance to the ride. 

The only thing open and running at full blast is the music for the outdoor shops.  
No talking please. 

Note at the east end the Yard House has it's own outdoor music competing with the mall music.No. Just no. 

So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night. 

Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve. 

We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food.We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star.The décor was nice but the acoustics make the restaurant very loud. A tray of wet glasses was on our table when we were seated and the hostess removed them leaving the table wet that she didn't wipe down.  The menu was wet with Coke spilled all over it. We wiped everything down ourselves. Not a good first impression.
The waitress was friendly. She brought our drinks but didn't bring the bread basket until the second time around. The Rosemary bread was very good but tiny slices about 1/4 inch thick.My husband had to ask for more. Two meals a pasta dish and pork chop dinner were very good but the crab and shrimp stuffed Talapia was not as expected and not very flavorful. It came with about 1 1/2 cups of Kale- that's a lot of Kale. Probably would have been better to eliminate the Kale and serve this dinner with a small dinner salad. 
The worst part of the evening  was a table of misbehaved children sitting next to us. The kids were running around and playing with the drapes and screaming. Some parents just don't care if their kids are annoying  and being rude to other guests. This is not a restaurant for young kids. The hostess should have seen we were four adults dressed up (dress shirt and tie) for a special evening and sat us at a table away from rowdy children. There are many excellent restaurants in Madison. You have to be amazing in one way or another for me to return. Not amazing.stopped in the minute I spotted the place. fake chicken burger was fabulous. Fish tacos were a bit over baring  .  Salad was a waste of time. cucumber, mint water was very good. However there were no prices so the total was a shock! Not sure I'll go backStopped here while on a Sunday drive.  Tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed.  She was rude and careless.  We walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better.  Unfortunately the same lady came in and started venting about her customers.  Seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore.  Too bad because the beer was nice and cold.  Great views too.Service is extremely subpar.  They messed up our order and we didn't notice until we got home.  Called to inform them of the mix-up and asked that they have our original order ready in 10 minutes as I drove back.  The woman on the phone didn't apologize and abruptly asked, "Have you eaten the meal?"  No, I just got home.  "You must bring back the meal that was wrong."  Huh?  I'm fine with that, but what will you do with it?  Re-serve it?  Feed animals?  Odd.  Of course my order wasn't ready when I returned.  I turned over the erroneous order.  Then another worker asked how she could help me...I informed her that my order was mixed up.  She said, "Well did you bring back the meal that was given to you?"  Yes, the other server just took it.  It was another 10 minutes before I received the correct order.  No offer of a refund.  No offer of a free piece of cake.  No sincere apology.  Crandall's---your food is good, but your service is simply awful.Coffee is fine, although I agree with Laura F. below. Service has always been VERY slow, despite 3 baristas working at the counter. I'd recommend not stopping here on your way to work, but its an OK place to pick up a latte on the weekend or get a bottle of wine.Agreed with Dave's review about the staff and service being a hit or miss. I normally don't make stops anymore to cold stone restaurants because their ice cream is so expensive. Plus, I don't care for the taste of their ice cream. Maybe it is just me, but I think it's overrated.So the Boar, as we affectionately call it. It's good for a lot of things. Darts, pool, Tuesday blues night (live blues band!), fun times, decent beer, waffle fries, and fried cheese curds (if you don't mind the sort that come from the freezer). The food? Not so great. It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.

I think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.

There isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said. I'll go back because my friends at work like it, but it wouldn't be my top choice. There are definitely other places that can fill my dart needs while providing me with at least decent, non-frozen food.

Sorry, Boar - the truth can hurt.I wanted to like it, I really did. The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... 

First off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. 

The BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. 

To give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. 

Over all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!it was okay.....small place but the food was good....large portions....I live in Sun Prairie, but I drive to the east side of Madison Wal-mart instead of using this one about half the time. This store is SMALL. And OLD. In a word: dingy. 

It does have a fabric department (as does the east side Madison store), which is better than that giant thing in Monona (though that has underground parking, which I love). The employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful. The cashiers are mostly the former. Having done that exact job, I can relate.  

They have a couple of small aisles with food stuffs (bread, cereal) and there are coolers in the front with milk and OJ, which is wonderful when all you need is some cheap fabric, a gallon of milk, and a tube of mascara. 

There are plans to build a new Wal-Mart right behind this one, then demolish this one and turn it into parking lot. I am waiting with baited breath.This is a brand-new Walmart that was built right next to the old one. They are currently tearing down the old one and, if I remember right, are going to use that space as parking lot. I hope that is correct, especially after my visit today. 

I saw three separate vehicles (one on the way in and two on the way out) waiting for somebody to back up and open a spot. No big deal, right? Except that both cars sat and waited for a few minutes. I thought the first car was disabled because it sat there so long. 

The store itself is fine. It's a Super Walmart, so it has the grocery store side. It's a lot like the one in Monona, but without the fun underground parking (best thing I've ever seen in a Walmart) and escalator. I tried to check out using the self-checkout because it is faster when I only have ten items or so. Well, this self-checkout machine was troublesome. It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why? At any rate, the guy monitoring the self-checkout had to come over and help me three different times. This was in no way faster than just going through a regular register. 

The cashier who helped me to checkout and a guy I asked about Nutella were both nice, but it was an overall frustrating experience. Having the last part be the worst part didn't help.Don't go in the Drive Thru if there are more than 3 cars. You will sit there for 20 minutes.Was very disappointed at my recent experience at the mousehouse!!! I have been there before and they had always been so nice not the case this time the lady talked down to us about the difference of white and yellow cheddar and just seemed over all bothered by our presence.  So needless to say we didn't ask for a single sample.  Next time we will not going back.I've been to Laredo's three times now, and it just doesn't do it for me. The food is fine, but nothing to write home about. 

+ pretty cheap
+ lots of combo platters so you can easily mix it up
- chips/salsa not that good
- food is only average

Tonight I ordered the chimichangas. Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones. Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each. 

They brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter. She explained that "this one" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and "just throw it away." 

A waste, because it wasn't really that big of a deal if they'd brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn't dead set on having one of each. 

As it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*. Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). 

*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat. They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing.

Other blips in service:
- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)
- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made "plates" out of napkins

So, yeah. The food there is fine, but the atmosphere (dark) and service (lacking) make it pretty low on my list of Mexican places in Madison.Ole? 

Oh no. 

I can safely say I tried it, right? They have an extensive menu, reasonably priced lunch specials, and decent salsa, but that's about it. Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better. Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth. Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way. In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it. 

Got a rec? 

Let me know.The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  

The first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.

The menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected.  

However management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up.  Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable.  It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order.  So we did.  It took a really long time for the food to come up.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees.  The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, "oh sorry!" as she dashed away and that was the end of that.  

So the food was average, not great.
The service was rushed and unfriendly.
Not worth the price.In other cities or other years, I could see the Barrymore getting a higher score from me. But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.

Its use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.

The building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.

Bottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).I am finding it extremely unappealing to shop at East Towne Mall nowadays. There are just no good stores there. I do shop at Lane Bryant when they have sales but lately, their seasonal lines have been horrible or Bath and Body Works whenever they have Areomatherapy on sale for $5. Until then, there is no point in shopping here. There are certain wings of the mall that I hardly go down because they are just crappy shops put in to fill space. Also, the food court sucks. No good eatery places here at all. Just...nothing. It's really unfortunate because Madison doesn't have much retail stores to offer and there is a ton of potential for East Town mall if someone put the investment into it and clean up the atmosphere more. Location is great, stores are not. Please, someone with money and time help East Towne Mall!I'm not sure what happened to Dexter's fish fry, but wow - it seems like it's on a downward spiral, which is unfortunate, because it used to be one of my very favorites.

I've revisited this fish fry three times this year, and each time has been underwhelming - I'm not sure if they've switched fish suppliers or what, but I've got serious reservations about returning for the fish fry.

We arrived last night (9/21) at around 8:30pm, and the place was packed to the gills.  As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area.  An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned.

With drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod.  We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends).

The service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night.  5-stars for service.

The fish arrived and it was swimming in grease.  Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting.  The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting.

I love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish.  But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye.  I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here... :-(

The rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus.  I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area.  I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent.

Our check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish.  It's a shame, because I like Nick, and I really like the crew here, but something is amiss...

:-(Lobby and swimming pool are excellent. Staff above average.  2 stars because the rooms ( clean but)  were beaten up and in need of a serious facelift. Stains on the rugs. Scuff marks on the door. Overall , for the price( 95 with aaa rate), I was satisfied with my stay. If they renovate the rooms I would give it a 4.5.Been several times and always the same. Fun space, menu reads very well and you expect to get a great meal, but food is totally plain and unexciting. All hat, not cattle.  Don't waste the time or money, many better options around town.The restaurants that Food Fight offers are all subpar, with one exception of Johnny Delmonicos. Aside from the Johnny D's the others all serve incredibly bad food. I tried El Dorado's once and it was terrible, on top of things they charge so much for a margerita served in a tiny glass its ridiculous.They make a good brandy old fashioned, but otherwise I am not a fan. Like a previous reviewer, I am also grossed out by tartar sauce that has been sitting out for who-knows-how-long. And the fish fry? I really don't see any greatness there.  Cave-ish interior, average clientele age of 75--really not my scene.Grade: D

Yeah, I order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets... Duh.I was really looking forward to this place after reading the other reviews. It wasn't bad, I would say 2.5 stars. I want food to be as good as what I cook or better and their  food was not even on par with my own cooking. It's like Olive Garden, fills the void but not memorable. There were four of us and no one was very excited about their meal. 
The worst was when I took my son to the bathroom. It's down stairs but you could smell urine at the top of the steps. I was done with my meal after that.
Sorry, there are many other places in the area to try. We won't be going back.This is a review on their catering service.   Angelo's catered an event we went to and we were looking forward to a really good meal.  It wasn't Italian food so maybe this was part of the problem but the food was a big disappointment for what we had to pay and there was very little help with the service.  A few of the items were pretty good in flavor but overall it was a lackluster  meal.Quick review: very large menu, offers all you can eat fish fry, unusual layout. Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.

Detailed review:

After taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is "around the corner" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.

We walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section "in front" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on "the other side" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.

Our waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.

Our drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.

We were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. 

But, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted "off"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.

Curds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical "from the freezer bag" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.

Fish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  

Battered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite "lifeless."  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.

Battered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.

The bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.

Tully's = fail.

Service = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)
Food = 2 stars (based on fish only)
Value = 2 stars
Misc = 2 stars (not real exciting)

I'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.I've made a goal this year to work my way down Monona Dr/Attwood/Willy Str eating at every place along the way.

Tullys 2 was pretty Meh. I went on a weeknight at sat at the bar. The clientele here are definitely older, fox news on the tvs, and there was a decent swivel factor on the night I visited. There was a grampa with a 10 yr old or so grandkid sitting at the corner of the bar. Ah, Wisconsin and the practice of taking your kids with you to bars for drinks.  They had decent happy hour specials for rail drinks and mass market beers. After a bit, I ordered dinner of a chicken cordon bleu sandwich and fries. They had some special parmesean herb fries that I asked to get instead of the regular ones because that sounded a bit more exciting. They were not exciting. More like they shook the jar of Kraft parm over the fries. The sandwich was alright. Not horrible, but nothing to write home about either and a tad bit dry. It took me a bit to flag one of the two bartenders down to get a side of sauce for the sandwich. I thought their prices were similar to if I'd ordered a meal from Culvers. I don't see myself ever wanting to come back for dinner. 

There is also a lot of booths and stuff for dining and several pool tables. Smokers may like this place because they seem to have an okay outdoor smoking area with tvs out ther and some protection from the elements.Went here for a routine check up  and wasn't impressed with the service, facility or prices.Drive a little further and find something better.Staff was very young and lacked a sense of professionalism on any level and it was obvious there is a lack of leadership.  
Was a busy evening, the wait was reasonable though at about 15 minutes for three of us.
Shortly after being seated a young guest at another booth got sick on the floor.  Our server, who was taking our order, immediately made a big dramatic scene about how she couldn't see stuff like that and ran off to the back.
We then watched no less than 10 staff (not an exaggeration) walk by/over/around the prominent mess with no effort given to cleaning it up or acknowledgement to the guests around it.  Finally a young man with a mop bucket full of dirty kitchen water showed up to mop up the mess...  No thought given to the fact that it's a biohazard in a restaurant and obviously having no training in how to handle the situation.
He then parked the mop bucket in the dining room next to us (splashing the disgusting mix onto the wall) while having a loud conversation with another staff member about it.  He came back a few minutes later with a bucket of pungent bleach water and towel to hand wipe the floor and, using the same cloth, the seats and table top.  
Our server did eventually come back and let us know that she did put our order in.  Another server then stopped by to tell us how it reminded her of a scene in a movie where a bunch of kids puked after trying tobacco chew... I really can't make this up.  It was an experience that I will never forget.
The food?  My burger was average, but not bad and my wife's clam strips were inoffensive but rather flavorless.  Our daughters spaghetti was predictably bland.
I will be in no hurry to go back.Let me start by saying that I often carry around a back pack.  When the occasion calls for it I upgrade to a purse.  But most of time I am traveling with munchkins with insatiable appetites, so I've got snacks in there for them and/or lots of books.  

We go to this theater all the time, and I take my back pack there all the time too.  But this time it created a problem.  

We got our tickets and were happily standing at the concession counter ordering tons of overpriced, bad for you, food when this teeny, tiny, little teenage employee approached me and advises me that they are going to have to search my back pack.  WTF??

They got a homeless guy out front smokin' a doobie with some teenagers, but they want to search my stuff?!?!  But you see I was wrong about what they were looking for.  

Knowing that I had nothing in my pack that was without prescription, (ho ho hee hee) I willingly handed it over to the mickey mouse club house member.  She opens the first big zipper and finds, OH MY GAWD!!  

RICE CAKES!!!  

I am so busted.  That's right she was lookin' for food contraband, not drugs!  The first thing she says is, "yep, food" and she hands the pack back to me looking disgusted.  She then advises me that I have to leave the pack locked in the office during the movie we came to see.

Because you know, even though we're standing there with food from the concession stand, we still might wanna eat them rice cakes instead!!!!  

At this point everyone is looking, and my fellow movie companion is standing there eating his newly purchased popcorn enjoying the live action theater.  I thought I wouldn't care if she wanted to hold on to it while I watch a movie, but my credit cards, cell phone, iPod and prescription drugs were the real items of value and that had me worried.  

Thankfully for me all the contents of my pack were still there when I got it back from food police.  However the movie sucked, I sat there the whole time wondering if her and her teenage friends were rifling through my pack.

All this because of rice cakes my friends.  So the next time you dare purchase some, just remember it's better to use them as target practice than to mistakenly bring them into the theater!!!

Even though bringing in outside food was not my intention this time, I can say that next time I go, I think I'll wear a trench coat and inside I'll have bags of popcorn and cans of soda strapped to me so I can smuggle in the contraband and be an arsehole just for the heck of it.Expensive for food that is mediocre.  The wait time for the food was incredibly long and they weren't even that busy.  Lame.ooooohhhh
haaahaaa wow
no
nope 
never againI live fairly close to this location so it is just too easy to shop here rather than drive 20 minutes to another location -- although sometimes I wish I had when i see the produce or shady peeps hanging out in the parking lot / "cafe area".

The produce is notoriously bad. I don't know how they get away with selling moldy fruits and vegetables. 

Bottom line -- you can get away with it for most of your groceries (non-perishables). I would go to another store or to your local farmers market for produce items.I was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews, but since it was closest to our hotel, we gave it a try.  It was fine. Nothing worse than you'd find in the SF Bay Area. Buck up, little campers. Quit being so stuck up.My girlfriend and I decided to have "tea" a.k.a. lunch at the Teeter House.  First of all, the place could use a refresher or some spring cleaning.  It's kinda old and dusty inside.

We ordered turkey sandwiches and soup.  The soup came out cold and we got the wrong sandwiches sent to our table.  No big deal.  They fixed the mix up right away.

After our sandwiches and cold soup, we still wanted to experience having "tea" so we ordered a pot of Earl Gray tea and their dessert sampler to share.  The sampler came with small square cheesecakes and cream puffs.  The tea was really good but the dessert must had been frozen and then put in the microwave because when we bit into them, the bottom was warm and the inside was frozen.  

Not the experience I was hoping for going to the Teeter House.  On top of it all, the waitress was really loopy.  This is probably why the food was wack.  I won't be back.Let's start with positives... 
- Large and open entrance (way better than Gammage, which is a never ending hallway) 
- Intimate stage/seating 
- Helpful/sweet/attentive staff 
- Bathrooms - they were clean, well lit, well decorated, and smelled good :} 

Negatives... 
- Naked statues in front of the theater - don't get me wrong, I'm all about art being an expression of beauty and the human body being beautiful, but I also appreciate artistic traits: class, taste and reverence...none of which were present in front of this theater. 
- Concessions, a dumpy little espresso kiosk? LAME... 

I'd like to come and see another show here to give the theater another shot, because honestly, the show I saw (which I refuse to name/advertise) was poorly written, boring and the acting was the worst I have seen in a very long time...This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  

The outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.

My hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  

My girl Jacqui liked her entree.Bar food. Nothing more, nothing less. Had chicken soft tacos. Burgers looked good. Tried some chips and salsa too. Read other  reviews about customer service...spot on. Our party had lots of food left on the table when we left. Coworkers gave it a 'meh' as well. No need to return ever again.Not so rad.The egg yolks were neon yellow ... literally. That is not natural. 

Go to Matt's Big Breakfast!!I came here after a grueling evening swim practice so I was really hungry - which means anything should taste really good, right? I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars.For a sports bar located blocks from Chase Field and US Airways Arena, I don't know how they get away with having so much non-Phoenix sports memorabilia on the walls.  Only in this city!

i was in here *after* a DBacks game and it was practically empty.  They have a decent enough draught selection.  But the place itself is kind of skeevey.  The bathroom was gross and there's a window at eye level across the wall with the urinals so you can look out into the bar (maybe to keep your eye on the game?).  But it means other people can look in.  Strange.

They were showing the ASU game at the time and the TV I was seated in front of had a terrible fisheyed picture, it almost made me nauseous.

Feh.So we were walking up 5th street in search of Conspire.  We walk and we walk and nothing.  We finally come up to what appears to be a restaurant converted from a house.  Seems dead so we ask the construction crew there and they assured us it was open.  We walk in and the first thing I see is a black man behind the counter.  My first thought was, cool, a diner of sorts.  May be this is some breakfast joint and I'll get me some grits.  Then a white waitress sits us and presents us the menu.

My first thought was, "What the?!"

Most of the menu contained asian fusion dishes.  Huh.  Skepticism flared up immediately.  The waitress highly recommended the CRAB PUFFS, especially since the crabs were flown in fresh regularly.  Honestly, I could not tell that there was any crab in these things at all.  They tasted like, well, cream cheese deep fried in won ton skins.  That's it.

The waitress also recommended the House Dynamite and the PAD THAI.  I opted for the latter.  It is unlike any pad thai I have ever eaten.  Ever.  The sauce was soupy.  The noodles were not pad thai noodles.  The dish didn't have some of the items one usually expects from pad thai, like say, oh bean sprouts.  Surprisely, I actually liked the flavor of the dish.  It wasn't bad and had a nice kick to it.  But there's no way that's pad thai.

I also had some thai iced tea, which came from a bottle.

On the way back to the hotel, we came across Conspire (on fifth st!)!  We look quizickly up at the closest street sign (5th street) and down the street (5th street).  Wha?!  Damn you downtown Phoenix with your numbered streets and avenues and repeating streets!OMG NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

like Grand Master Flash said about the white lines "Don't Do It"
Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang 
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

my Torta Burro had no flava-dang, i was sad panda mang

this business has been in operation too long and clearly the owners (i doubt the original owners) stopped giving a shit. if they did the average rating wouldn't be 2.5 stars. i remember this place as a kid, i don't remember ever eating here. so i really cannot comment on how great it was. but like Sing High, the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary. just avoid this...it's not good. my plate looked sad, just a naked burro with a side of hashbrowns that were hardly crispy anywhere. the salsa was tasty, but i would hardly add a star to it. the service was compitant, but i couldn't understand her. i couldn't blame my ADD on it. my friend liked the menudo, but i wouldn't make that a saving grace for this place. cool logo on the building. very retro..but do not be fooled by it.I'm not sure what everybody raves about. The place, in itself, is very cool. You park around back and they have little artist's huts and the inside it cozy and would be a great place to maybe hangout and have a few drinks. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and maybe I ordered something on their best that wasn't their "best" dish, but unfortunately I won't be going back to find out. 

I took it to go, which may have been my first problem. I paid just under $9 for the wrap (asked for without onions) and opted this time for chips. When I got back to the office and opened it up the wrap was in paper and you could see mainly pits and not much stuff inside, but I figure maybe all the good stuff is piled right out of site. After ripping off almost a 1/3 of the pita, I finally get to the good stuff....and my first bite. Ick! onions!!! I had asked for no onions and now my first bite I was chomping on them. Put the pita down, scraped out the onions that weren't hidden, and tried again. The tahini sauce poured of of the back on the wrapped paper and as it hit my plate I then noticed how oily it was....the sauce actually separated in front of my eyes. Ick #2!! 

When all is said and done, yes, I'm full. The chicken was ok, a little dry, but edible. Was it good? Yea ok, it was good....was it $9 good? Definitely not. And sadly to say I won't be returning for lunch to try anything else on their menu that may have peaked my interest before.I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?

Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.

I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.

Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you.Never really been a fan of the food here...and after this visit...i'm still not a fan.  The wings there suck, the beer is over-priced and now most of the girls are not even hot anymore.  Additionally it didn't help that our server was new and didn't smile or look happy to be there at all.  We pretty much had to beg her to smile at least a little.  Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while, For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good.I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. 

customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it.I was amazed how much the food sucked at this place.. I had the Sicilian w/ chips (looked like Lays chips).  I had a much better experience at the OSF in Seattle.  You would think the 2 would be the same, right?  I give this place 2 stars for having the old Paperboy video game present.. but the food... nah..  I'd rather go to a Olive Garden or Buca Di Peppo next time unless I'm in the Seattle area again.What happened here? This used to be a place that you could go into and get a fine meal and out within an hour. A month ago I was there for a business lunch and it took a total of 2 hours for 4 people. They kept loosing our order they told us. The manager comped most of the meal for us. 
Today I stopped in and this time had to nearly hog tie the waiter to take our beverage order. Once he got there we ordered our food items for fear he would never return. About an hour later our food finally arrived. The food is great but the side salad was a disappointment. 
BIDWELL FAMILY: Now that you own this historic restaurant, stop by and check out the poor service that you are offering.Ordered a drink here that I get at another location regularly. The other location told me there is a very specific way to ask for the drink, which will make the baristas job easier and I was told it was a company wide thing. So I tried to order it here the same way.... BIG mistake... The cashier, Heston was rude and seemed annoyed that I would be asking for the drink in such a way, he even told me to "get to the point". I admit, I was struggling to order it because I have completely forgotten what exactly to say but his attitude toward me was unnecessary! I apologized for "wasting" his time and he said, "next time just say what you want. We are busy and I don't have time for this song and dance!" Good. Grief! I have to mention... I was the ONLY one in the store at the time, so I am not too sure why he was in such a hurry...

I will not be coming back. I suggest you do the same!We pulled over to grab lunch here this weekend based solely on the appearance... It looked like it would be great!
Their menu didn't seem that unique, but the girl who took our order was extremely friendly and offered some advice on her favorites, which included a pita and for both of us to get sides of the pasta salad. For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful. When our food was brought to us, my pita already was torn all the way down, so there was no way I was going to be able to manuever eating it with my hands. I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife. 
Flavors were good, nothing special. Chicken was dry, and the pasta salad was nothing I would write home about. 
We left full, somewhat pleased, but could have had the same experience for half the price.This is the most understaffed Subway in Phx.  There is no doubt in my mind that it will easily take me 20 minutes to get in and out of this Subway.  The problem with that is that I am usually trying to catch a movie.  It really gets frustrating to watch one person do all three parts of the job alone while some kid sits in the back and acts like they are busy.  

All of that being said, this Subway is consistent and usually tastes good.  The place is always clean and the workers TRY to move you through as fast as possible.Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait.I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland.  Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try.Wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast... Not bad but really nothing special and pretty overpriced. We ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon. Bacon was chewy and tasted like it came out of a microwave and probably could've made something better at home. $21 for the burritos and 2 bottled waters. Seat yourself and pick up at the counter. Friendly service and clean but boring, bland ambiance. Nothing like the location at Town and Country. Try the breakfast club across the street.I'm from Philly, which of course nothing in Az can compare to a real cheese steak. I've visited this place a couple times, and  as the saying goes,  third time was  a charm(not exactly). The guy in the kitchen was rude to me when i tried to grab a few ketchup packets and napkins near the register.I honestly never sat down and ate in there, which I didn't know napkins and ketchup were on the tables. What made my visit worse was that a gentlemen behind me in line did exactly the same thing,and   nothing was said to him.I felt like the kitchen guy was border line yelling at me as if I was going to steal all the napkins and ketchup packets from the  other paying customers... who would do such a thing??? lol. Anyways, my cheese steak was nothing special, which I was hoping it would be on my third visit.And the way i was treated was unnecessary.This place is just hanging on.   I remember back in the day when they the piano bar, 80's club, sports bars, and a ton of other places to check out.

There a a few restaurants still open, but barely.  Never seen any of them even close to half full.

I pretty much just go to the theaters here nowadays.  At least there are no crowds to deal with.Jeez, I didn't know this place was still alive until I moved back.

I think it's safe to say that this shopping center was a failed experiment in bringing people back to downtown. Sure, alot of people are slowly trickling back to the center of the city, but not as a result of this. The lifeblood of this place tends to be the suit types that swing in for happy hour at Hooters or other bars that think that interior design is bolting an rusty Route 66 sign to the wall.

If this place didn't have a movie theater, I'd brand this place with one star.Growing up in Arizona I remember the days when this place had a lot going for it. Recently, I ventured back on a visit back home and was less then impressed. It would seem that whoever is managing this place now cares more about what the place looks like then whether or not there is actually anything worthy of shopping or eating at. The slide has been so bad here that I fear it will become a ghost town if the economy gets any worse. Before long it won't be worth the rent for the few retailers that are left occupying it. Shame...I like that it's right downtown by my house.

I dislike that it's mostly vacant.After finding out there was a shopping center less that a block from my hotel I was ecstatic! BUT after going there at 11.15am when they opened at 11am I was soooo disappointed to find that there is only one real store here. The rest are typical chain restaurants. LAME! The outer decor is nice though.Yesterday I was downtown & hungry, so I dropped in here, my first dining experience at a Scholtzsky's, & I ordered a medium Pastrami & Swiss on rye.  The bread looked like a big round chocolate cookie, but had a rather normal taste, not even particularly "rye",  The pastrami was lean, tender, & didn't have any gristle, but it was smallish, & the sandwich alone was over $7 with the tax.  I'm a soup lover, & they had some soup there, but it was around $3.50 for a small bowl, so I passed.  The restaurant itself was comfortable & appropriate... built up to take you back to the 1950s.

In my view, with these reviews, it's all about comparison.  I don't usually review non-buffet restaurants, but there was such a contrast between Schlotzsky's yesterday & the place where I ate today, I just had to write!

I was over at Wal*Mart in Laveen for a few things.  You could smell the fresh bread baking at the Subway right there inside & it made me hungry, so I dropped in & I ordered a sandwich there comparable to the one I ate yesterday at Schlotzsky's, plus a bowl of Cream of Broccoli soup.  My 6" sub, plus the fairly good-sized bowl of soup cost about half as much as the competitive sandwich alone at Schlotzsky's!  BOTH were $4.33 TOTAL!  (I'm not mistaken;  I have the receipt right in front of me as I'm typing!)  Not only that, the Subway sandwich beat Schlotzsky's hands down even without the soup!  It had much more on it, & was really good.  Then, there was ALSO the Cream of Broccoli soup, nice & hot, & delicious!

Bottom line:  Subway amounts to the same kind of restaurant, but is genuinely better than Schlotzski's, where nothing about it is bad, just not as good...  2-Stars not as good!

10/18/09 Update - Today I tried Scott's Generations.  Now THAT'S a Deli Restaurant!  * * * * *Ok, I'll admit, Phoenix has terrible BBQ.  If I were to rate Honey Bears in relation to other BBQ restaurants in the city, it'd get higher.  But this ain't no relative rating, and Phoenix needs some better BBQ.  So I'll continue.

If you like a sorry excuse for BBQ, this is it.  Meat tastes completely flavorless and dry save for the Memphis-style sauce.  Meats are not smoked, and I'm doubting whether they are actually even barbecued.  When you walk in, there is no aroma of BBQ, just meat.  Almost if they were oven cooked.

Memphis style BBQ should be rubbed and smoked.  Meat should have a faint smoke ring and outside should be distinctively seasoned compared to the inside.  The sauce here is good and is a must to keep the food edible.  Sides are completely forgettable.  I gave Honey Bears 2 stars because the prices are good. 

For those who think BBQ needs to be doused in sauce to be good, well, that's your opinion but contrary to popular belief the sauce should be a compliment to the already good seasoning of the meat.

In short - still waiting for a real BBQ restaurant.  This ain't it.I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh. 

With my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns. 

The ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course). 

Collared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either. 

Service was friendly & efficient. 

Warning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!This used to be my favorite, but lately the pulled pork hasn't been as good.  I tried the hot links, but not good at all.  Love the beans and the sauce.My husband and I decided to try a new place tonight. I usually love barbecue, and when he suggested we try Honey Bears, I was more than happy to. First of all, I have to admit, I worked for Famous Dave's years ago and although I couldn't stand being employed there, they had some darn good barbecue and I'd still go eat there if there was one closer by. So maybe my expectations were too high for Honey Bears, but they fell way short. 

I got the pork brisket sandwich. I couldn't even pick it up, the bun was so soggy. Like snot. I tried to pick it up and it just disintegrated and all the meat fell out. I ate it with a fork, seeing as I was too starving to send it back. The meat was very moist and tender until I got a huge bite of the nastiest, driest chunk of meat. Like hard and chewy beef jerky. I have never discourteously spit food out of my mouth before, but that was too unpleasant to swallow! 

Moving on, the fries were good. The beans were awesome! The bbq sauce was lacking in consistency and flavor. The cheese in the mac was a bit thin. The ribs I had that came with their combo 3, well one was alright, the other one was almost all fat. 

All in all, I didn't "hate" it but I'm not going back. There are better places to spend my money.The sauce is good and they're always offering Groupons. I've tried their other food and its terrible. The fried chicken and catfish had absolutely no flavor. The bread is cold and soggy. The peach cobbler and mac and cheese were obviously microwaved (too hot in some spots, icy cold in others) and lacked flavor. If you're going for a pulled pork bbq sandwich with fries, you'll be fine. Anything else and you'll be really disappointed. 

Overall totally overrated.Third times a charm and don't plan on coming back. The counter help was extremely rude. The 1/4 I had looked like it came from the grocery store and drizzled with sauce. All 3 times that I have been here haves been the same. Rude staff and poor quality at the central avenue location pretty much decided that I will not return.WOW!!!!  This place has really lost it's touch.  I remember the days when my friends and I would celebrate eating here. Now I doubt I will be back.

I came here and experienced and witness some of the worst service.  What made it worse was the fact that my pork sandwhich was dry as hell.  

The only reasons I am leaving 2 stars is because of the fond memories I had of honey bears back in the early 2000's and the fact that their sauce is still amazing. Other than that I won't be back.My order of spinach and artichoke dip with chips at Cooperstown:

--Amount of dip: George Bush's popularity at the end of his presidency.

--Number of chips: Barack Obama's current popularity.

That's one disappointing appetizer. When I tried to request more "George Bush popularity," I was told I would have to order an entirely new plate, because "George Bush popularity" has to be made fresh.

Lame political metaphors aside, my Saturday night experience at Downtown's "other" theme restaurant was blah. The corn beef on my sandwich was tough. The waitress, while extremely friendly, forgot to bring my table's silverware. We had to ask for the utensils after receiving our sandwiches. At least the water glasses were kept full most of the time.

Last night's experience at Cooperstown is demonstrative of most of my experiences at this restaurant. Just OK. The prices at this restaurant, however, lead one to expect "good." A better execution of this restaurant's menu and improved service would lead to my adding a third star in the future.First the good... Tap beer tastes good and reasonably priced.
Now the not do good.... Ordered the WMD wings and were extremely disappointed. They are made with store bought mild sauce and breaded. Ugh :(  

Stick with Zips in Scottsdale.Welcome to Alice's overpriced tourist trap nightmare! Food is expensive and totally tasteless. Seemed like they used generic frozen ingredients for all the dishes we ordered. The fish fry and fish tacos were the worst. Seriously, $13 for 3 skimpy, dry pieces of fried fish? C'mon! The "Mike Myers" sandwich was just OK, but not really worth it. If you're a fan, grab a beer and check the memorabilia on the walls, but better get your grub somewhere else.2 stars for the service and speed, but don't expect inteligent cuisine. Quick and easy, not good and cheap.Spent north of $1200 for simple food in one of their boxes last week. After charging me a %20 "service fee" on the food, they ask for a %15 tip as well. Going to the ball park next time.I wouldn't exactly call this the best gyro I've every had, nor would it be a close second - or third.

The gyro was made with pre cooked pieces of (beef/lamb) gyro and not sliced off a cone. I'm not sure where this new trend is coming from, but I've had a few gyros from othe Med. places around the valley, and all were made with the same or similar pre packaged gyro pieces.

In case any gyro / greek / mediterranean restaurateur cares, the pre packaged gyro meat is NOT GOOD. I'm just not sure what else there is to be said. If you can't do a decent gyro, I'm just not coming back. Sorry. :/The body worlds exhibit was great if you can get thru it in 1-1/2 hrs. Forget any appointments after 3pm--you will be rushed and not worth your money. Don't purchase the $5 audio phone unless you have 5 hrs to spend there, the dialogue is informative but much too long to accomodate time limits. I am sure this is because the science center wants you to come back 2-3 more times to listen to it all--NOT GONNA HAPPEN! We are members and don't appreciate being pushed to come back 3 times to see the entire exhibit, leave the center open until everyone has finished if you are going to schedule late appts like this

Full Review:
This is one of those times when "Meh. I've experienced better" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.

Got there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(

The salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.

We ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.

Food Details:

Guacamole:
Very simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing "wrong" with it there's just much better at countless places.

Rice:
So far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/

Beans:
Just went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.

Cheese Crisp:
No real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.

Green Chili Tamale:
The texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another "not bad but far from great" items.

Ground Beef Taco:
The shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.

Chili Relleno:
Oh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.

Enchilada:
Suffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.

Red Sauce:
Don't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.


Could this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there.I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.The first time I went here, everything was absolutely spectacular. No complaints at all. 

Went here for the second time, last week and found myself far less satisfied than my first visit. There are not many vegetarian options, which is normally ok for me. I'm not difficult to please. Unfortunately, if I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, I'd really prefer not to find meat in it. This distinctly tainted my views on the place and I will not be going back here.Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.

Service is generally friendly, but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?ive had better.Why would I make an appointment with any doctor for a shot, and only a shot, and wait an hour for my service?

 It is a random Thursday, and have waited an hour now. No apologies, no regard for client's schedules, nothing. If they weren't so good in every other regard I would change doctors. 

I drive 30 minutes to get here and will not stay if I'm continually left to wait an hour. 

Also, 3 different nurses have walked up to me and called me 3 different names.  

THEN, they had me wait an hour to get the shot and then tell me I should have peed in a cup (nobody told me that???). I go to pee in a cup and then have me wait another 20 minutes to make sure I'm not a leper. Get it together!My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said "we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?"  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us.My boyfriend and I went there last night, and I've been there for brunch before as well. It's down the street from my house, so I WANT it to be good because it's so cute and cozy, but I've never had anything I've actually liked there.

I got the burger, which was decent, but it had this kind of garlic cheese spread on it, and when you're eating it on porous ciabatta bread, it has a tendency to leak out the holes in the bread all over your hands. My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, which was burnt on the edges like it had been cooked too long. We also weren't filled with confidence when 100% of the time we've passed by, the cook has been outside on his phone smoking a cigarette. Maybe my boyfriend's food was overcooked because he had to take a very important call.

When I went for brunch, I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was pretty flavorless. For what I'm paying there, I'd like to actually enjoy my food, but I was so underwhelmed, and since it's always been dead in there and it's got wood floors, everything you say echoes, which can be awkward.

One more thing: when you look at the menu online, the "lunch and dinner menu" is the lunch menu. The entrees and the prices change when you actually eat dinner there. I would have saved money and been better fed by going next door to America's Taco Shop.The food was tasty, but the service was tasteless.I've been driving past this intriguing little place for years now, and finally stopped in to satisfy my curiosity. I had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch, as the food wasn't very good, but I was craving a hamburger and in the area, so to MacAlpine's I went.
Once I figured out which door granted entrance to the diner (seriously, it took three tries),  I was greeted by some awfully pretty and very in-character waitresses. They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic.
I looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain.
Seeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back. But the atmosphere and food quality would suit children well, and I saw several come and go, usually with their grandparents.Place is decent.  I advise not staying here right now since they are renovating and have noisy construction going on in the buildings lobby. My shower looks dirty.... Maybe I stayed here at a bad time. 

One good thing is its that it's close to the airport.After recently visiting La Grande Orange in Phoenix, La Bocca in Tempe, and The Parlor in Phoenix, I can honestly say I have had much better pizza than Red Devil. 

Four of us came here last week for a birthday dinner, and I honestly just wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian Special and the Greekfest, and both were overloaded with toppings and falling apart, and overall not too flavorful. Olives were everywhere, and if you are only a partial olive fan, it isn't too great. 

Plus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent.

overall probably wouldn't come back.Summary:  Middle of the road Italian food.  Decent price, very large portions, weak on flavor.  Zero atmosphere.  Good service.

The wings are solid, and good for a group to share ($27 for 40 wings).  The honey heat wings are better than the original flavor wings, but both are above average

The salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing.  Move on.  

The pizza - decent crust, but totally lacking flavor.  The cheese, sauce and toppings amounted to nothing.  Better than domino's (what isn't?), but lots of better options for checkered tablecloth style pizza.

Entrees were huge.  Chicken Parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor.  The red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked.  Another guest got the Chicken Marsala and there was agreement it was better than the Parm.

The room is barely decorated and unmemorable.  We got there at 5 on a Sunday and the place was packed full.  My party of 8 was squished uncomfortably into a table against the wall.  It must be noted our server was extremely nice, prompt and thorough.Seriously the slowest experience ever! There were four of us really early...the restaurant was pretty much empty. We ordered three entrees and four desserts (It was so early that I was still full from lunch!) Anyway, they bring out our desserts first! We kinda all look at each other and the waitress takes a cue and says, oh the food isn't ready yet so I thought I would start you off with some desserts. Okay, cool, we will take it. We ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food! It was nuts. We went in for a quick bite and it took 2 hours! Haha and flagging someone to get us our check was darn near impossible. Oh and it is in a sketch part of Phx. haha!

The food: Their Tortellini Alfredo was good! I think that was my fave of the entrees brought to us. None of us tried their calzones or pizza, but we were close!

Their desserts: They only advertise one...their trifle. It is good, but not damn near as incredible as their version of the pizookie! I had a friend who wanted to make a baby with the cheesecake and their brownie with ice cream was respectable. Save room for dessert here...and just get the pizookie! Yum!The manicotti's marinara is flavorful and tasty however, the pasta itself though is dry and overcooked. I've tried it both while dining in, & take out and they are essentially the same. The Portobello ravioli is inedible and gross with the pasta far too thick and pasty to be enjoyed. The accompanied sauce was just more of a magnified flavor of mushrooms which repelled rather than delight this diner. This sauce should be 86'd altogether and replaced with a more appealing marinara. The restaurant itself is tired and old and in sore need of upgrade and redecoration. The service is very s-l-o-w but cordial when you get it. All in all, I give Red Devil 2 stars as they are living in the past and are in dire need of upgrade; menu, building & service. Their long history is one of the only positives which attract me.I dined here last week and had a half platter of ribs.  Some ribs had minimal meat and were dry.  Some ribs were great.  The BBQ sauce is a tangy red sauce.

Food I would rate a "3", I've had better, but it's not bad.

Location - this place was dirty and there was spilled BBQ on the floor near the cash register.  The cashier was aware of the spill but didn't clean it up promptly as she had to warn me to watch my step.  Another customer was complaining to them in Spanish on how they messed up his order.

Service/Cleanliness: 1.
 
Overall - this place deserves a 2.

Who would like this place?  Someone who's gotta have BBQ and nothing else serving BBQ nearby - it will do.Hot links were very average. Terrible texture.The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.

The animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...

Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.I enjoyed walking around on a quiet afternoon.  

I was disappointed because we couldn't see many of the animals that we were hoping to see.  The habitats were built in such a way that kept animals hidden from the visitors.  I felt like we were out in the wild trying to spot the animals.  Some of the habitats for the animals aren't that large, so I felt bad for the animals, like the cheetah.   I think the PHX Zoo has some work to do to make the place a little more visitor friendly.  Maybe they should visit the Bronx Zoo, the most amazing zoo on the planet to get some ideas.  

Despite my negative feedback, I was impressed that you could get up close and personal witht the giraffes.  I've never seen anything like that before.ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.

The center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with "Asian" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.As Paul Krendler said to Dr. Hannibal Lecter while drinking drugged broth before Lecter fed him bites of his own brain, "It's not very good, Buddy."

Everything we tried tasted kind of old; like it had been sitting out too long.  The fried rice was seriously the best part of the meal.  

My meal (Shanghai Style Meatballs, meh) arrived a good 10 minutes after my husband's Kung Pao Chicken.  Lame.  

We had high hopes for the appetizer, as the menu listed both "steamed dumplings" and "pot stickers" on the menu....still on the lookout for a good Shanghai style dumpling we gave them a shot.  They arrived well after the main courses and were nearly inedible.  Alas, the hunt for Xiaolongbao continues....I found some frozen options in the Ranch Market next door and I'm hoping for the best!  

The staff here was very friendly, but with the so-so food and clunky service I doubt we'll be back.Made reservations months in advance and no car was available.
Screwed up the whole first day, as it was dedicated to finding a replacement.
Had to go to the Sky Harbor for a car but almost three times the cost.  They had many cars there and we had to rent one there, which leads me to believe that there was some type of bait-and-switch here.
One of the supervisors helped us out a lot in receiving a discount, but that was too late.
This place was unreliable and when you need to be at an important occasion, you can't rely on them here.  A man at the hotel the first night had reservations too.  The next morning, he missed his appointment after they told him he was set.
Nice, nice people, but the service left a lot to be desired.
I gave them two stars only due to the girl behind the counter had tried her best.  It wasn't her fault.  The decisions were made above her.Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive. 

At least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table.We went during happy hour and sat in the bar area. The place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything. I ordered a strawberry margarita which was WAY too sweet! It was half foam on top and I didn't feel like it was worth the $6 price tag. Usually when I go to mexican restaurants they bring you chips and salsa however, they had a buffet style layout with a few extra items you don't normally see. The service was great and overall a clean establishment! I wouldn't recommend for happy hour again- too many other great restaurants in the area.I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.

The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the "fancy" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.

Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.

This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.I've been here a few times now and service has never been great but never bad until tonight.

I step up to the bar and order a Guiness and was told their systems are down so it will be a few. Fine. I get my Guiness and listen to obnoxious people do a karaoke version of Cult of Personality and read the news on my phone. Time for beer number two and the systems are still down. No worries, I'm paying cash this whole time anyways. I give the lady my money and wait for my beer. A couple minutes go by, she pours drinks and explains to people that her systems are down. She's really befuddled as if she's never experienced life without a computer. Others walk up and order drinks and receive their beers promptly while mine hasn't been poured yet. After about 10 minutes I just say screw it and leave. I'm sure dealing with down systems is stressful but if I'm paying cash it should be a non-issue. Knowing that the others came up to the bar after me and were at the time running a card tab makes it even more confusing.

This night aside, food is generally decent. The place lacks a pinball machine. Owner seems like a nice enough guy in the past.

Note to someone: not having a computer is no reason for poor customer service. Also, perhaps having someone pitch in behind the bar would be a good idea so that the easily flustered bartender doesn't get so stressed out next time.

I hope somone got to enjoy my beer or that the extra $4.25 went to buy some sort of stress relief for the bartender because that $4.25 didn't do a damn thing for me.After purchasing a daily deal here I did a month of yoga going about 4 or 5 times a week.  The instructors are great and I felt amazing after every class. The downside is that the studio seems a little dirty and always had a stinky foot odor in the studio due to the carpet and sweat combo that goes on. Yikes. Also, I am not sure Bikram is for me because of the strictness of the practice. I desperately missed my down dogs. So as this studio is not for me it is worth a try if you are interested in hot yoga.I had high hopes for The Eggery. 

Not because I thought it had potential or was even that hungry.

For me, the notion of an egg-themed restaurant sounded like the result of  insanity. The kind of mad science you see in comic books and Discovery Channel shows about hunting ghosts. 

My brain had conceived this idea of an egg-obsessed madman, ceaselessly forging egg-based delights so that he may share his much-too-specific love of eggs with the world.

Unfortunately for me and my imagination, The Eggery is not insane like Bizarro or Dr. Weird. 

No, it's a "Kevin Costner movie" kind of crazy.

The menus look like they haven't been changed or updated since the 80's. Which would normally be refreshingly retro, except the 80's weren't necessarily a good decade for eggs. Come to think of it, I don't think eggs and time travel are compatible. 

The omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes. 

"You got chopped up ingredients in my eggs!"
"You got eggs in my chopped up ingredients!"
"...are you thinking what I'm thinking?"

The Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you. 

"Hahaha, you could've gotten this same dish at Hometown Buffet, and it would've tasted better, too!"

The Eggery has no means of separating their pancakes from their competitors so they just make them bigger. 

If you can help it, avoid ordering the sausage.

In fact, if it's not made of eggs, don't bother. They won't make it right.

Your sausage will be overcooked, your hashbrowns will be burnt, and your coffee will taste like they used the toilet water. And the carafe of coffee they give you is usually only half-filled.

And don't bother complaining to the manager. After all, he's probably the genius who assembled this crack team of apathetic, inattentive doppelgangers posing as a wait staff. Dude probably doesn't even know what eggs Benedict is supposed to look like.

Fuck this. I'm going to Denny's.I went here for breakfast with my wife in December 2009

First off, the waiter we had was friendly and accomodating, and the menu has all the standard fare for a breakfast restaurant.   But, some of the other wait staff should have been fired for their unprofessional loud gossiping just 5 feet from the nearest customers table.

Decor- very country and kitch.

Price - If you don't get the specials then the menu gets pricey quite fast.

Food Quality -  the quality of the ingredients they use is noticeably lower than typical restaurant quality fare. The only flavor in the sausage was pepper, the eggs are so so and coffee gave me heart burn. The other thing to add is that the water they bring to the table is not reverse osmosis treated water like in most restaurants, it is the standard foul tap water of the neighborhood.

All in all, I won't come back here.  Right after leaving, we went to AJ's next door where they were cooking their weekend omelettes with Gourmet coffee. Next time we'll just go to AJ's instead and be happier.  But at least the company I had that day was awesome!We came here with comp'd coupons about a month after a less than stellar experience at The Eggery's sister restaurant The Good Egg on N. Central.  Refusing to go back there at the risk of getting the same waitress, we headed up the road to use the coupons.  It was realtively busy. They sat us next to the emergency exit in a renovated add on, enclosed patio type area, it was cramped and uncomfortable, but remained hopeful.  Our waitress came through took our drink order We got our drinks quickly and were not ready to order just yet.  Mistake!  We then waited, and waited....with no sign of our waitress or any other one for that matter in our area.  We waited...finally about 30 min after being seated a lady who looked more official than a server asked if we had been helped, she must have seen the famished look on our faces and seen we were about ready to walk out.  She then took our order and we recieved it relatively quicky (within like 15 min of taking the order or less).  Thankfully we had no where to be in any specific time.  We left full, the food run of the mill.  Thankful we had coupons in all the experience was barely worth the tip we left.Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours.This is the kind of place you find in a mall.  Fast food salad, pasta and pizza.  I had a salad/pizza combo.  The pizza was cold and the crust had a weird metallic taste.  The salad was your standard plate of bland greens.  With all the offices and the hospital nearby, you would think there would be better options for lunch in this shopping plaza. Nope.  That's why I always end up at the Good Egg.  It's hard to screw up an omlette. Despite the high convenience factor, I will not be back.Pizza is ok I guess if you dig cold pizza. They are set up to serve people fast but from the lines I see at lunch time I don't understand why they must display a bunch of food when nobody comes in.
The staff seems very lazy and often you will find 2 or 3 tables ready to be cleaned. They could help this just by putting in some trash cans so the customer can help you clean the table. The ordering is basically fast-food self service so why not the clean up? 
Extra star for the coldest bathroom in town.I'm only half Asian so I'm not sure if my opinion counts. tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up.  yet the place was packed.  

There was enough oil on my food for me to deep fry my thanksgiving turkey, luckily it was not peanut oil otherwise i would have ask for a to go box.My husband decided to surprise me with flowers the day before Valentine's Day, so he stopped at McDonald on the way home from the office.  The flower arrangement itself was beautiful, however within two days the flowers started to die.  We contacted the shop and they told us we would need to bring the flowers back in order to replace them (there was no guarantee that they would be replaced)

In the past we have ordered flowers from Cactus Flowers, a similar situation came about and without any questions asked Cactus Flowers delivered a new arrangement.  We will not be shopping at McDonald again, instead Cactus has our business for life.The beer is cold, but nothing memorable. I had the Vanilla Porter (like a lackluster version of other well-known, better executed Vanilla Porters). It was cold and hit the spot, but that is about it. My husband had the Trooper IPA and it was just "OK". We both tried samples of other beers - me, the Cream Ale upon the waitress's recommendation and the husband, the Rye IPA. The Cream Ale was not good... reminded me of a Budweiser with a creamy head and mouth-feel. The Rye IPA was too sweet and gross according to my husband. 

For dinner, my husband had the Green Chile Pork and he was decently impressed with it. The tortillas that came with it were very tasty and the pork had just the right amount of spice. 

I had the SunUp Salad which was pretty good minus a few bad pieces of Spring Mix greens. The prickly pear vinaigrette didn't taste like prickly pear to me, but rather like a bland, slightly sweet vinaigrette. Still good, but could have hit it out of the park if it had actually tasted like prickly pear. 

Service was good... waitress was very friendly and attentive, but not to the point of being annoying. 

I am glad we live on the East Side of town where there are better breweries! I don't think I could handle only having SunUp as a brewery.Very awkward and inconvenient lay out. The rooms are in multiple towers, and the parking is in a paid lot a block away that you have to present coupons to leave. Decor is shappy and very out-dated. Huge empty lobbys and hallways wasting space. The restaurant is only open after 5, as is the bar, and there are no places to eat in the near vicinity. The rooms are unattractive and small. My company is paying for this, but this place is massively overpriced, especially considering how many nicer and cheaper hotels are in the same area.What is the big deal about this place?!

It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick.

Service was weird, and I'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didn't know they weren't ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad. 

I'd go back here again but I wouldn't really be too eager to.I suppose the food is good because this place is always packed with people.  I'm a huge fan of the chocolate chip cookie dough pizza with ice cream.  I just can't stand the long waits for everything, so I only go once every year or so.  The service is never fast.We've lived close to this Ace Hardware for 6+ years & bc there's no Home Depot close by, we run in here for odds & ends quite often.  
This is a nice store, they've got a good (not great) selection & the guys who work here are usually helpful. HOWEVER, the girls at the registers are NEVER friendly & they lack the common sense to say "thank you" after taking your money, This has been a consistent theme over the years.  We try to go to the True Value at 16th St & Bethany Home when we can. True Value usually has lower prices too.  
The clincher for me personally was when I bought several things (incl some firewood) at the front register & right after walking out a manager came up to my car asking if I had paid for the firewood. This manager walked right past the girl at the register, who I had just paid, to get to me!  She apologized, but I was really offended & annoyed that she didn't think to stop & ask the cashier if I had paid.  
Don't expect exceptional service & you won't be disappointed.We probably should not have waited as long as we did, for what we were served. 

It's not bad, I guess... if you feel it is adventurous to try flavors fused with one another. I'm down with the fusion, only if it's done tastefully. I mean, after all, you are there for the taste. 

Seared tuna... was far from seared. They just let the flimsy slivers of tuna saturate in the acid for a bit to give it a seared look. But uh, it was missing the crisp in the sear, and all I could taste was the acidity and pepper sprinkled on top. 
Takoyaki... supposedly had some octopus bits in it. Luckily, I found 1/4 of a tentacle in these things. However, this was sabotaged by the sauce these little balls were drowning in. Too much basil in the hoisin or something. 
The caterpillar... haha. Cute, but was searching for some significant pieces of eel in here. Sushi rice was a bit soggy too. 

Ebi-ten, basically udon/soba (opted udon) with two shrimp tempura, was okay. I've whipped this up myself before, so...

Wow, unfortunately not very memorable. Good job, presentation... but not so much a sensation.Been here a handful of times throughout  the years.Last night was my most recent visit. I was in the mood for noodles something..we started off with the app of potstickers in an extremely spicy broth. Holy crap this is extremely spicy hence the name of the dish. 

I ordered a beef udon dish with veggies and udon.. it was okay.
husband had chicken parm. Shocker! prob wont be back for awhile spent $40 bux and had better at YC's Mongolian today : )Weird...

I expected this to be a Japanese restaurant and had been wanting to try it. I've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles. So I walked in and BAM! Italian decor? WTH was going on.

This restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.

They don't really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, "WELL WE HAVE SALADS!" -_- 

They need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious! 

Honestly, I probably won't be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn't bad, just wasn't special.When a waiter takes an order by memory, his accuracy must be 100% or he opens himself up to criticism.

Guess what?

He forgot an entree. 

There were just 2 of us and 4 dishes between us.  He apologized after delivering the dish about 20 mins after the others came, telling us the kitchen was backed up. If that was the case, why were the other dishes on time and why did he act surprised when we reminded him of our missing dish? Just own up to it! Btw, he ended up comping the dish.

Portions were not huge, so take advantage of the low prices and double up on your orders!The RAMEN is excellent.  The owners are sweet and the ambiance is pleasant.

I gave it a low rating for the customer service. My first visit I was seated in the back and had to wait for service a lot, for long periods of time.  I didn't mind due to the gracious hospitality

My second visit, was terrible. They saw me walk in and didn't offer me a menu or greet me. A second customer walked in after me and they helped that person first, instead of me.

Finally someone asked if I had a question. I said no, I'm waiting for a menu. He turned to the hostess and said "oh, why did you tell me she had a question?" and then he just walked away leaving me to wait longer. 

When I finally got a waiter, I already knew what I wanted, I didn't waste the waiters time. I waited a LONG for my food until I ran out of time to eat it. THE WAITER DIDN'T CHECK ON ME AGAIN UNTIL I STOOD UP TO LEAVE. He had the nerve to ask if I needed anything. I told him I ran out of time to eat and had to leave. He didn't apologize, he just put the check on the table and left again. 

I do not know if this is a place where you have to wait for them to come grab the check or if you are supposed to take it up to the hostess but he never came back so I took it up to the hostess. She just stood there, IN FRONT OF ME, drying wet cups.

I was just there for a lunch break soup. Why did it take an hour?They claim to have the lowest prices... They don't. I needed to buy some supplies. I checked pricing at Photo Forum and Tempe Camera. Tempe Camera was cheaper, yet the guy at Photo Forum declined to price match. No one asked if I needed help when I came in. My experience was not pleasant. 
I like Tempe Camera better. They are always soo helpful and they have WAY more stuff. Not to mention they aren't smug or pretentious. Can't say the same for this place.Overall, I would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it. Small tables and cramped. The waiter spoke so fast that we had to have him repeat the specials three times. He served us so fast that I got the feeling he really didn't want us there! We felt uncomfortable even asking him questions and pointing out our issues with one of the entrees. I had the veal piccata and it was perfect! The wine was excellent, but our other three guest where extremely dissapointed. The veal chop is much smaller than it used to be. One pasta dish was served very dry and at a cool tmperature. We sent it back. Bread was just ok. Not the amazing kind that you expect in an Italian place. The other dish was just so so. There are so many restaurants to choose from in this area that I won't go back.I would like to give Karsh's 4 stars and here are the reasons why.  If you want kosher, they have it.  If you'd like to have sugar free, they have a nice variety, provided you go in early in the day.  They actually have quite a nice variety-a little something for everybody-and they do take orders.

Sound's good doesn't it.  What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.  The result is for the most part I tend to avoid the place.  Scott's Generations, the deli a few doors down, is more appreciative of your business.  I'll spend my money there.  Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.

If you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   

Another reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.  I'll face the craziness those lanes cause to go to the Bashas and Scott's Generation but not  Karsh's.  

It's rather sad to have to write a review like this.I was so excited about going here because I'd bought a groupon for $20 of sugary indulgences and I was going to make to most of it!

However...the goodies just weren't good enough to make me want to waste the calories and finish even a single treat I'd bought. So, here's a run down.
Petit Fours - Massive, not petit at all and flavorless
Napoleons - The vanilla cream in it simply tasted congealed and didn't have much vanilla in it. Puff Pastry was flavorless.
Mini Eclairs - Frosting was good and chocolatey, the filling was the same as the Napoleons.
Rugelah (Chocolate and Raspberry) - Looked Good, but let down by their bland puff pastry. It's sad to say but the Walmart bakery ones are much, much better.
Chocolate chip cookie drop thingys (can't remember the name) - Again these had minimal flavor.
Mini-cheesecakes - blech. I'll say no more.

I didn't try the special frosted cookies but at $2.80 each it seemed very expensive price to pay inside the bakery they're made. After all it's not like they have high distribution costs to pay for when travelling 20ft from the kitchen to the display case. And at $2.80 I expect a more professional looking effort at coloring the cookies.

However, I did like the service! The girl working there was friendly, helpful and would be an asset to any store.So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  

Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.

The musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.I've been here a few times and unfortunately its never been a great experience.  I think the first time it was a three star, but the last time was definitely a two--maybe even a one and a half star.  The service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large party with three kids, but it they clearly weren't busy and it was a weeknight.  It took them about 20 minutes to get a table together for us, which was fine.  But then it took them about another twenty minutes to take our orders.  We were so hungry we ended up devouring four baskets of chips before we even placed our orders.

The chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.  It definitely wasn't anything to drool over.  It was edible, but not great.  Plus its not even super cheap.  

Its a pass.Spot check on this place = now closed. I live in the area and cruise by once a week. When it was open it was ok at best.A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....

When Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). 

When Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the "lean" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was "okay" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.

After our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.We go here late night around 2 am every night we get out of the club nearby. If it weren't for the fact it's 2 am and we're usually pretty hammered I would never stick around for that long to wait for our food to come out! There's usually a wait (even at 2am) the place is packed. There's always a cop sitting at the bar, haha. It just takes forever to get acknowledged when we walk in, to be sat, to have our order taken, to get our food, to get our bill, etc. It usually takes well over an hour for all of this. Under normal circumstances I would walk out of a place like that. If the servers were all really friendly it might make up for it but some are nice and some look like they'd rather be anywhere but there. Which is understandable I guess but still. I do agree that it is fun to people watch here.We call this Gay Denny's or Jenny's. 

It's really like any other Denny's. There's no reason for you to drive to this one because it makes more sense to go to the one in your neighborhood. Usually, we go to this one when there's an event in Downtown Phoenix. It's nearby.

Other reasons that I go? My friends are poor and Denny's open late. Otherwise, you should never eat at Denny's.The only reason I come here....it's closer to me than the one in Tempe.

Otherwise, I would recommend the Tempe BE. The quality of clothes are better & the prices are better. I actually see no-name brand shirts with tags from Ross priced at like $14. Umm, I'd rather go to Ross and pay $7 for the shirt. The jean prices are a little higher here as well. And less sale items.This is the first time I've had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasn't close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didn't trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store.We had a great night here last night for our anniversary and we brought our 23 year old son from Los Angeles to celebrate with us. We loved our night, but that was mostly because we were with this young guy who we don't get to see very often. The white bean soup had very few white beans and was basically an overly-salty italian soup. The filets were delicious but extremely overpriced as was the pork tenderloin. The service was great, and they brought a few strawberries and some whipped cream as an anniversary treat for us. 

We like Coup des Tartes but the only time we can afford going here is when they offer a Groupon or some discount. Honestly, the prices on their regular menu are just sky high. It's very disconcerting when you first walk in and look at the menu. I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand. 

I'd like to suggest to the owners of Coup des Tartes that they take a serious look at the menu pricing and cut it back a bit. Stop with the Groupons and focus on providing a value and we'll be there once a week.

Review Updated on 8/7/2012:

Wow, did we have a disaster with this restaurant. I originally gave it a three star rating. I think their food does still merit a 3 star, but I am going to downgrade them one notch for the way I was treated the other day.

We had a Groupon (yes, they still focus on those promos) and it was going to expire in five or six days. We left a message early AM for a reservation for that night, and then never had a returned call. That was the first bad sign. When we called back and spoke to the owner, the guy was rude and just plain nasty. No, they had no reservations that night, and the other nights we suggested (mid-week) they couldn't get us in before 9 or 9:30 and so on . . .  Later, I called Groupon and asked what they suggest. They told me that as long as you make your reservation before the cut off date, the restaurant will still honor your full value of the Groupon on the date you go in, even though it is after expiration. I called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line. "No way" he replied - "That's not how we work Groupons. You only get half the value - the amount you paid." So I put him on the line with the Groupon rep, who told us both that the guy has to honor the Groupon. Well, he opted not to do so and hung up. Honestly, this restaurant is cute and the food's not bad, but with an owner like this, why patronize them? On Saturday, when we could have been in there arguing with this fellow over our bill, we chose to have dinner at Durant's. Now THAT is a 5 star romantic restaurant. Please, avoid places like this where management is not on your side, the customer.Funny...when I return to my office after eating here, my colleagues raved about how awesome it it. Not as funny, I didn't agree. I did like the atmosphere and the service, but I thought the prices were a little high for lunch although the serving was good. I had the chicken fajitas which were ok. I thought it was a different kind of style than I am used to so I wasn't impressed.

I'd like to give it another shot before I totally condemn a place that is obviously popular, but it's back to Chuy's and Ernie's for now....I always used to love the wings from here but in the past two years they have gone downhill...Customer service blows and the wings hardly have any meat on them.  Try another location they are all not the same.. Marcias Long Wongs in S. Phx is much betterThis place is a blast for entertainment. You feel like you have crashed a greek wedding. I think the next time I go, I skip dinner and just have a drink in the bar. The food is overpriced, bland and it is so loud you cannot enjoy your company. If you come for dinner, you sit thru the band playing the same rifts over and over. I can only yell in my neighbors ear, so the rest of the table is forgotten. But for a rowdy group that just wants to drink and dance, this may be perfect!I keep trying and this place will not stop disappointing me. Lower your expectations and you may enjoy it. 
The idea is right the execution is terrible. 
I am not old but this place is brutally loud. I mean painfully so. I mention it and they turn and walk away. 
The food is priced right. The bartender / chef doesn't care anyway. 
It's cheap and obviously satisfies many. 
Unfriendly should be the first warning.Here for the farmers market, but am appalled at the upheaval due to the management's remodeling/destruction of long standing architecture. (This city has been oblivious to its' cannibalism of structural art.)this library is just plain depressing. its small, old and smells of it's age.

i would avoid this library..no fun will be had here.I've been in and out of this place for the last 2-3 years since I work so close to it and little has changed. Well,  everything except for the staff who may as well change every other week explaining a lot about the service or lack thereof.

Moto is run by both pretentious and puerile people who make the tragic mistake of thinking that they are either clever or fun. They are neither. Their menu is only half as ridiculous as their thinly veiled tantrums between employees about customers and co-workers. Well, depending on which menu you get, because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers. 

No joke, any one menu you see is incomplete because you have to get their "secret" menus to see what they really have. Often these same menus are woefully inaccurate anyway making any one menu pretty useless overall. You may as well cross your fingers when you order. My eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head when the staff explained this fun gimmick to me.

They burn through waiting staff like the place has a revolving door, so an all-too frequent sight is a woman sobbing her eyes out just outside the building because she got fired. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the boss will be out hollering at them making it even more attractive. Yeah, I want to eat THERE; where the women cry.

For the record, these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant (Formerly a Shogun Express), peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast "this place is condemned, but eat here anyway" sort of look and feel. 

You know what they say about eating in a low-lit environment, right? The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant, but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various "taxes" to punish customers. 

I'm not kidding. I observed a guy who got hit with a "Geek Tax" for bringing in his child holding a McDonald's cup, he was less than happy for the remarkle expense for a bowl of Chicken. I asked about it later and they explained that they fine people for various reasons and sneak it onto their bills.

It's not a great place to spend time, but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway, you'll also come to embrace the ugly, uncomfortable furniture, which is meant to compel you to leave. So it's ironic that everything takes so long.

The food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety (and stupid list of in-restaurant rules) are pathetic. The management is barking mad, the servers can't juggle tables and the prices are as reliable as the unreliable menus.

If you MUST try this place, try to do the take-out service if possible. It's the only way not to be disappointed. Eat in at your own risk. I don't drink so I can't speak for their alcohol, but I hear their beer selection isn't bad.Decent sushi, I prefer to sit up at the bar counter.  I went there for lunch the other day by myself and it was fast service but there were tons of "regular" types in there drinking and chatting up the staff.  It made me wonder why they were just hanging out on a week day in the middle of the afternoon...but they are lucky I guess. Oh the food: I started with miso soup and edamame (both hard to mess up), they were good. I ordered a tempura shrimp roll...it was okay, the end pieces had the parts you don't eat so there were only like four pieces.  Overall it was okay and one of the only sushi places by my office (now that I work nearby) so I'll probably be back.  I'm open to recommendations...but I've definitely been to plentyyyy of better sushi spots.  Ohhh and the parking lot is a nightmare -- whether you're trying to run into Subway or Moto this shopping center is sheer chaos during lunch especially.I like World Market just fine, but had an unpleasant experience at this particular location the other day.

There was a display on the floor  full of throw pillows, and it was clearly marked "50% off" and "clearance" in multiple spots around the entire display.  Obviously, leading one to think that all the pillows in that display were part of the sale.  So I picked out two, went to check out, and they rang up full price.  I informed the girl at the register that they were marked half-off...she was nice enough, but she wouldn't honor the mistake - most other stores will.  

Fine, not a huge deal, but then some guy off the floor comes over, and very rudely snaps at me, "No, you're wrong, those ones weren't marked.  Only (name) ones are." 

"Um...yes, they were. I was just there.  It says clearance right above them." 

For some reason, he felt the need to keep fighting me on it.  Very annoying and embarrassing to have to be dragged into this argument in front of a line of people.  He's SO sure that he's right that he asks me to waste my time to follow him back to the display, so he can show me himself and prove that I'm wrong.  So I humor him, walk back, and show him the large, red clearance sign directly above the pillows I had wanted to purchase.  By now, if I were in his shoes, I'd be feeling like a real piece of work.  But no, not this guy.  Not only did he NEVER apologize, but he would not admit that he was at fault.  Instead, all I got was a half-assed mumble, "Well, it's wrong..."

Irritated by now, I decided to not purchase the pillows and started to walk away.  As soon as I turned away from him, the guy calls over another girl that was working there - who had nothing to do with the whole  fiasco - and he starts yelling at her in front of everyone within earshot, blaming her for putting the sign there.  Essentially, pushing his responsibility off on someone else so he won't have to admit fault.

 I won't be going to this location anymore, courtesy of this guy who acts like a 12 year old.This Ulta is close to my house and I waited way too long to order my makeup online and wait for snail mail arrival. Decided to go in here today knowing they have the Smashbox products I needed. I wanted to try something different and was excited to try some new makeup. Always love when they help you out. Well the store was somewhat busy, it is the weekend, and they only had 2 women working in cosmetics. One of them was nice enough to notice me and tell me she was working with someone. So I stood and sat around for a good 10 minutes while the other girl helped 3 other people who were there after me. I even asked if there was anyone else who could help. I mean come on, just because I'm not an aggressive older Biltmore snob doesn't mean I don't need help. I went as far as complaining to the manager and she offered me a free gift! Not help with what I wanted, not a good time to come back but a free gift.
 
Needless to say I'll be taking my money to another store. Probably the last time I'll shop  here.Like most Einstein locations, I'm unimpressed with the way the business is run.  The bagels aren't  bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one.  The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8:30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay.

There are some pluses.  This location has plenty of seating (however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop).  It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime.  It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein.

Judging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level.  However, each location seems to always have a steady flow of customers, so why should they work to improve the massive flaws?Not a good place to take your 90 yr. old friend. Please turn up the lights when you have the " Early Dinners"  I'm sorry but four little pieces of bread for SEVEN dollars, really? then to get a special and it has a small piece of fish and about a Quarter cup of salad for $29! Don't get me wrong I'm truly not a cheapskate but in this economy to pay $145 for three dinners, then have to have a snack when you get home is terr able!!   Won't be back!This is NOT the place to buy any GPS or GPS accessories. 

My GPS mount got trashed by Delta, so I went here to pick up a replacement (near the airport, 10 min drive)

Unfortunately, they have the worst selection of GPS accessories, and I did buy something but does not really work, so I have to return them now. 

Service was...okay, I didn't see a soul that was working in that area until I reached the casher. Casher was very nice gal though, so for her I'm giving 2 stars. Store gets minus 5 stars.Last time I visited Duck & Decanter I was very disappointed. I have been visiting this place since high school and it has always been great but for some reason this time everything was off. My sandwich bread was hard and inedible, the topping were sparse, and the pasta salad was just not good.Shocked! I can't believe the number of people that voted so high on this  Sea food restaurant.  The sea food is fresh, but I'm not impressed by the presentation or culinary creativity of the restaurant.  I thought I would never go here again, but after reading the yelp votes I will make a point to visit the Fish Market Restaurant again.Terrible happy hour sushi menu!

Ate here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!  

Since I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.

Probably won't be returning anytime soon for happy hour.  Certainly not since I've found a new place for happy hour sushi... Tempe's Sushi 101!Now this comes from a foodie Indian..The management just changed...and the food got worse. The food got worse but the service got a little better than earlier. The butter chicken is way off and was sweet and the Buffet wasn't that impressive. Although,I would recommend you go there for the buffet, because of the varieties offered.Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.

Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with "free" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.       

Farewell, Flavors of India, farewell!Got bad service from the scheduling people, they schedule patients for doctors who can't even help you even though they know why you were visiting.  And this is after they canceled the appointment on me and then rescheduled me for a doctor who couldn't even help me... Resulted in losing three weeks of treatment.

If you can find another clinic.This new group of employees doing the drying might have all the proper paperwork but they don't have professionalism! 1 guy seems to be the loud mouth ring leader, even refused to help another employee asking for assistance cause "it's his cousin and he can say that". That vehicle had to be run through the car wash because it waited too long.For me, the best thing about the Armadillo Grill was the waitress.  Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.  

As far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.  

I was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.  

My friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled "yeahs" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.

So, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.

As for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace.I don't get it , you have to make an appointment to get a drink , The bartenders (3) make you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you and just stand around looking dis interested .
The service downstairs is better ,but the food is blaaa and very slow from the kitchen .
Now the worst part , the price , its ridiculous $35/40 for overcooked oily food .
Arnold " I won't be back" 
Ps , it smells .........NYPD had been a staple for our family, but we've moved on. I am from the northeast, and very particular about my pizza, and am willing to pay the extra for it. I first experienced NYPD at another location, and fell completely in love. Continued to enjoy on a time to time basis as there wasn't a location close to where I lived. Moved very close to this location, and literally ordered take out the very first night. Very happy, excited about our new home being so close. We made NYPD a weekly thing for us, still for the most part as take out, but the food quality seemed to be slipping. Something different was off with each experience. It eventualy got to a point where we questioned why we spent the extra money on quality that was getting to be less than ideal. We reserved ourselves to finding another pizza joint in the neighborhood. Tried a few other places, eventually settled on one we liked, while not as good as NYPD once was, a lot cheaper, and better than it has been. I am not going to drop another buisness name into this review, as that isn't the point, NYPD's drop in quality is the issue. Sorry, we were once in love, but we have to break up....So, I always leave Giuseppe's stuffed full of rich Italian goodness, but my wallet sure suffers. The reason we don't frequent this neighborhood dive i because you get so little for such a high price. The food is high quality. The portions are tiny. The menu item that annoys me the most is the ravioli...you get about 6 little raviolis and are expected to make a meal of it. 

And I heard a rumor that they're raising their prices because they were just featured on the Food Network. 

How do you say "Sellout" in Italian?I had takeout from this place today and can't say that I would ever go back.  You can chose which ever type of sauce to put on your pasta, but they barely put any at all...my pasta was very dry and hardly had any flavor.  I would rather have a microwave dinner.I think this guy has let his 15 min of fame go to his head. Came here last week with a couple girlfriends for dinner,  The price we paid for just OK bland and flavorless food, cheep wine with a three times the price  price tag, and the luxury to sit on flimsy outdoor chairs, rolled in a napkin silverware and the best yet, plastic water cups was mind blowing. I felt like our waiter was up selling us the whole time and the hovering cocky owner was annoying at best. and lets talk about the " As seen on food network" sign hanging over the door and the diner guys pic hanging ever where, way overkill there. also what happened to a basket of free bread, come on $3 for bread are you kidding me. Whatever this place can suck it I wont be back.Saw this place on DD&D on Food Network so we decided to give it a try.  I read the reviews and was pretty much decided against going, however my hubby really wanted to try the Osso Bucco.  Overpriced imho and we will be sticking to La Fontanella for our Osso Bucco cravings.This place is really not great. The fajitas are, to be generous, merely ok, and much of the fare is actually bad. but i go here weekly. b/c it is in my office building and the other option is quizno's. so, i would mainly recommend this if you work in my building and are too lazy to walk to quizno's. god, that's sort of a depressing thought...I really was expecting more for being at the Esplanade. I would think that they would have a minimum standard or something, right?

Well, I had the grilled tuna melt. It was okay, nothing to write home about. My friend had a ham(?) sandwich and the soup, which he told the waitress was good but I noticed he didn't finish half of it.

I guess this is more of a bar than a restaurant but the food was obviously a low priority, even though it was a little on the pricey side. None of the veggies in my sandwich were fresh; avocado was not even ripe. Fries sucked.

Although the place was about 80% full, the wait staff still seemed surprised and ambivalent to see us come in.

I should have listened to my friend when when walked by the Quizno's!11/25/10

2.5 stars.

Wasn't able to secure a reservation at either Chandler's or Ahwatukee's Mimi's Cafe, but I did have two reservations at Rustler's Rooste and McCormick & Schmick's.  Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.

Reservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!

Food was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!

Run-down of the timing of food delivery:

8:25p- Water and server greeting.
8:35p- Salad and app. delivered.
9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived.
10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after.
10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented.
10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.

As I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking.
Even the women's restroom needed dire attention... Perhaps M&S' 4th year of T-day dinner will be more successful (I think this was the 3rd year since they first offered it), but I won't be back to find out.  Next Turkey day dining out, I'll make sure to place my reservation at Mimi's ahead of time!The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you know. We had to stifle a sneer when the waiter tried to push dessert on us. I have had their cheesecake before this, and it just isn't very good.

We are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre.

I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as "fine" but otherwise unremarkable.

Sorry, Penny. I hope your salary on the show increases due to the heavy product placement fees that CF must be paying, but we won't be back.I will say this may not be a fair review as a drink was spilled on me in the first 5 minutes of me arriving and it may have been 50% my kids fault. The other drink spilled on me from my other kid was 100% her fault so I may be jaded, but the waiter didn't seem kid savvy and placed the wrong order for my wife. The manager said we'd get a credit for that one so we'll see. I'd suggest not bringing kids unless they're restaurant trained.I try to stay fair and reasonably positive on my reviews of restaurants because its hard for me to be that critical of all the great restaurants I've been to.
However, when I go to get my clothes tailored and my shirt I had comes back looking like it belongs on a 12 year old boy, I just can't let that go. I'll be fair and say that the other shirt I had done came out fine. But either way, I'm gonna look around next time.I usually love everything from TJs, but recently the pasta tastes horrible. Purchased the frozen Pasta Arrabiata, and then this weekend purchased just the raw Penne. Is there a new maker of these products?Very, very disappointing. My wife and I are attending a conference at the Arizona Biltmore. Rather than joining the group for their offsite party, we opted for a quiet dinner for two at the Biltmore's flagship restaurant. It was a disaster.

We decided to try the Taste of April - a three course meal $48 apiece with optional wine pairings for an additional $25 apiece. The asparagus soup was outstanding. The lobster pasta was awful - pasta at the bottom of the plate was a perfect al dente but most was very under cooked. Dessert came after about 20 minutes of waiting - a plate of 5 small pastries with assorted fillings. The pastries were tough and dry, and the fillings were not good.

The wine pairings were OK - but served with no insight or explanation on the vintages being poured. The first wine was poured well ahead of the soup being delivered and a refill was not offered. The second wine was poured after we were chewing our undercooked pasta. And the third came out 10 minutes before its dessert pairing. Suffice it to say we had sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, and merlot. That's all I know.

Something had to be wrong, but that is not our problem. The waiter was friendly enough, but the service was awful and the food was below subpar. To their credit, the manager comped our meal and bought us a glass of wine at the bar. His actions earned the second star.I had dinner here while visiting the Biltmore, nice ambiance, on the dark side, sat at the bar and ordered the meatloaf, a big portion but a bit too sweet for my taste why they put so much ketchup in it I don't get. My salad was good, dessert totally sucked, 
I ordered the carrot cake and it looked like it came from a super market, what they dont realize is it should be served room temperature not out of the fridge, or it should be warmed. Still, for a five star resort the dessert was pretty sad looking and tasting...
I might try this place again during another visit, but I was not impressed.I purchased two Living Social deals - for pedis and waxing that I was really looking forward to using.  I still have a couple pedis and several waxings left, but I do not think I am going back.  The nail technicians were really inconsistent (sometimes I would get a soak, and sometimes I would not), my pedis took quite a long time (one was close to two hours) and the quality was OK.  And finally, I left a voicemail to schedule an appointment and I am still waiting to hear back (it has been 3 days now).  For a $65 pedicure this is not the pampering experince I would be looking for.  Going back to the salons that charge a third of it and provide a much better service/quality.  Sorry, but not impressed.The Blue Burrito of Sushi..Bad sushi in a totally average environment..If you can't go to Sakana or Hiro Sushi certainly try this..I'm a bonafide OC gal where sushi joints are like Mickey D's and Starbucks - one on every corner. Because of this, I figured my sushi expectations are not that high to begin with since I've seen and tasted so many places and I'm usually just happy to be indulging in my love affair with sush! However, I have to admit that this place did not leave me with the best impression and leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe sush is done differently in Arizona but it just felt wrong on so many levels.

My boyfriend and I ordered 4 different rolls including one of their "special" rolls of the day.  Again, I can put it out there that maybe I'm just a sushi snob and this place actually will taste quite good to everyone else BUT in any case...here were my major no no's of the night:

-My sushi staple is spicy tuna anything and I use this as my measurement for any sushi place. Zen 32's spicy tuna was not spicy at all and seemed to lack the use of siracha (chili sauce) that I have come to know and love. 

-The rice in each roll lacked the traditional sweetness and stickiness that makes sushi rice different from just plain white rice. 

-Each roll seemed to lack any flavor of fish whatsoever because everything was overpowered with ridiculous amounts of cream cheese and sauces. Makes me wonder what kind of fish no no's they're trying to cover up but bottom line is that I eat sushi to enjoy the flavor of the fish and there was none of that to be had here.

On the bright side, this place apparently has a great happy hour and serves sushi until midnight which is great when you're craving late night sush. Would I go back and eat here again? I would...but only if I really had to.This place has been around a long time, and I've been there quite a few times. It's hard to find decent Cajun food in Phoenix, but Kay's usually does pretty well.

Our last visit wasn't the greatest. The duck & andouille gumbo was nice, if not quite piping hot. I forgave that, as it's one of the few places around you cna find duck of any kind, or andouille for that matter. The shrimp etouffe came out stone cold, and the waitress quickly returned it to the kitchen where they nuked it to almost hot. Microwaved etouffee just isn't right. 

An order of dirty rice with a side of 2 links of andouille proved almost pointless, as we specifically made clear this was an entree, and expected the 2 links to be cut up and added to the rice. What we got was a small bowl of dirty rice with two tiny breakfast-sized links laid atop it.  

The crab cakes weren't bad, being mostly crab with little bread crumbs, but they really didn't scream authentic cajun cakes to me. Plus, they too were a bit on the cold side - even though everything came out quickly. 

On the plus side, they have Abita beers on tap. Turbo Dog is always welcomed - especially if it's on tap. 

Another plus is you can stop in on a weekend night (we went on a Saturday) even at 9p and they are open. The place was empty barring a few people at the bar. That should be your clue. 

My previous experiences here were all around lunchtime, with no problems as far as food temp, so I suspect that late night diners are getting food that has been sitting around in a steamer all day long. 

Regardless, I am only giving this 2 stars. Your mileage may vary.Alright.. A-hem... er, F*** I hate giving poor reviews! This place isn't HORRIBLE, but it most CERTAINLY isn't as good as what they charge for it.

I went here for lunch today because I was feeling adventurous. I felt the need for something new, and it was a toss up between Cypress Grill and this place. Unfortunately, I picked THIS place... We sat down and ordered my 4 year old the corn dog on the kids menu for $3.50. I ordered the 1/2 shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo $10.50, and my wife ordered a chicken po'boy and gumbo of the same $9.50.

Out comes my son's corn dog.  It was nice that they brought that out quick, because kids get anxious when waiting for their food. As do some adults, I suppose... nonetheless, it was one of those frozen-type corn dogs that you can buy by the box... As soon as I saw this, my feeling for adventure was snuffed.  The food DID come out fast. I'll give them that, but it was a bit shy of good.

1/2 Shrimp Po'boy: Keep in mind, they charge $10.50 for a full sized sandwich.  My sandwich had maybe 5 shrimp on it, some lettuce and two small pieces of tomato on the side.  The horseradish sauce was, indeed, good but there lacked anything GOOD to put it on. So I just dunked my two dry pieces of bread and 5 shrimp in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the taste.  The taste was good. but the price I paid doesn't constitute what I received.

Chicken and Sausage Gumbo: I must admit, my wife ruined this one for me.  She mentioned how it reminded her of the canned soup of the same, and, I sh*t you not, it DID taste like canned soup! the chicken was SUPER mushy, and the sausage tasted like they bought a kelbasa, sliced it up, and added it to the soup just before serving. It was not good at all.

I can't comment on my wife's po'boy, but it didn't look much better than mine. Two pieces of bread with some chicken. Meh...

That's right, I said it! Meh, Meh, Meh!!! And with that, I will be making a Meh list to put this in... Actually, I think I already have one.High End ? What make this high end?  Thy serve mimosas....and that is why some people think this is high end. I am in the restaurant business...as i usually say before writing a review. So...once again what makes The Wrigley Mansion high end....anyone ? The food is sub par. The service is fine. They have taken away several of the better offerings. 2nd time there and both times i asked what am I missing? Sure the mansion is nice...but brunch lacks...ALOT. Food was really unappealing and just zero wow..or even  "thats nice". No real substance to anything food wise. Too bad it could be the place for brunch.......it is losing what it should be and worse it is showing the lack of true culinary innovation and in my opinion screams " hey we are the Wrigley mansion .....oh and yeah we have some sysco mid quality food to prove it". Real disappointment.Keegans definitely has changed a lot since I was younger and used to go there weekly for their pot roast special. The layout is smart and the decor is ultra-modern bar"ish". 

The service was good, in fact, we felt that our server took good care of us,  but the food was Blah to be kind.

This place needs to figure out what it wants to be. If they want to be a bar, then the terrible food is fine, but if they want to be a returant, there needs to be way more quality control in the kitchen.

 I ordered the grilled flat iron steak ordered medium and I got a seared piece of meat completely cool (RAW) in the middle. So I politely pointed out that this meat was still able to MOOO and requested that it be brought up to temp. 

It came back a couple of minutes later only to be seared some more with now a rare, at best, middle. I gave up; I really wasn't interested in having a hockey puck piece of meat left after another re-fire. The plate also consisted off what they call a baked cheddar potato which in all reality is some kind of stringy shredded potatoes (Hash browns)  with some creamy cheese concoction on them then they were broiled for a few seconds to crust up the outside. They were very weird, their flavor was almost that of boxed au gratin potatoes and their consistency was that of the inside of a tater tot.

 In Fact (BREAKTHROUGH) I just came up with a great name for them other than Baked Cheddar Potatoes,,,,,,

Wait for it,

CHEESY SHREDDED TOTTS

Also note, when ordering the Taproom steak sandwich, what they forget to mention on the menu is that it's an open faced sandwich which can be fine if you know that going in, but we had to ask for a top for the sandwich because there is absolutely no mention of it...

Sorry, I wanted a sandwich, not a piece of meat on bread...Played the Links Course for the first time and will not be back.  The greens on the front nine were in terrible shape, like putting on the fairway.  Started at 3:30 and still paid $32 for the round, overpriced.I have been very disappointed in Avanti's lately. I used to love it. A friend and I each got groupons to go so I thought great can't beat half off. I hadn't eaten here in years. Nothing has changed it's dark and outdated. They need a Ramsey make over for sure. 

The service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent. 

The Caesar salad was very good. The veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good. The veal was rubbery and the breading soggy. The pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good. 

The Tiramisu was soggy as well. The cake at the bottom was soaking wet. Yuck

If not for the groupon I would have sent this back. But half off an overpriced meal made me think I got what I paid for. 

Well we had another groupon to use so we went back. The second time the service and atmosphere the same. 

Me thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back. This time I had seafood risotto BLUCK! The Risotto was undercooked and had no flavor. The seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp. This Risotto was a disaster! My friends vegetables were mush. It was worse than the first visit. 

The worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me. 

The long and the short of it I wont be back. Avanti's has slipped to Olive Garden level with Macaroni Grill prices! WAY OVER PRICED.What era is this?

That was my first thought as I stepped into this restaurant.  Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie "Scarface."  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. 

I came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   

The menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. 

For starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. 

We all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)

For my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. 

A few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.

Dessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. 

In my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check.Warning on Sprint:

Even if you pay the monthly handset insurance, they have engineered their policies to basically force you to purchase an upgrade and re-up your contract if you run into ANY hardware problem after the first year or so of ownership.

The insurance only covers a direct replacement. If your handset is even slightly out of date they will tell you to wait (phoneless) 3-5 days for the replacement to get to you.

Of course, you can always upgrade . . . for a fee.  . . 

But if you have made the mistake in good conscience of taking the phone to a service center first and waiting an hour to see if your phone can be fixed, and then decide to upgrade while there, that's an $18 fee for trying to get it fixed in person rather than just putting in your ticket online and waiting 3-5 days. 

When you call to complain, you will be told that the charges are "system generated" and thus can't be removed. I found that escalating to a manager (using keywords "cancel my account") and telling him/her that you have a system that will generate letters to the attorney general and your credit card company and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT tends to work. I got my $18 back and I strongly suggest everyone else do this as well. If you don't get what you want on the first call, call back. And again. And again.

These policies apply no matter which plan you are on, and no matter how long you have been with them, and no matter how much other business you represent as a corporate customer.

So why 2 stars? Because really all cell phone companies basically suck balls and have from day one. At least Sprint usually lets me connect.The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.

I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.

Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.The Short:
A downtown Chinese restaurant still holding onto archetypes linked to 'the good old days.' 

The Pros:
- Friendly and personable staff.
- Food comes out fresh and hot.
- Vintage decor.

The Cons:
- One refill maximum on soda.
- Staff members barely speak English.
- A singular ingredient often overpowers flavor of food. 
- Restaurant policies are designed for you to eat menu items the way they see fit or spend tons of $$$. ***EX: All items come only with white rice. You have to spend $1.50 for a small cup of friend rice. No substitutions.***

______________________________________________________

The Story:

I haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside décor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment. 

First, I'd like detail the food. The menu is laid out in a similar manner to any local Chinese restaurant across America. I always wondered why these are so similar. Is there a database they buy them from? Does the Chinese government teach its citizens how to sell to Americans prior to getting their passports approved? Is it a subliminal demonstration of the Red Dragon's united might? More than likely, the answer is I just eat too much Chinese food. 

China Village lost some points with me from the very start with their policies. First, sodas, which run $2 for a comically small cup, are limited to a single refill. This is often the highest profit item for restaurants and the owners plan to keep it that way with their authoritarian statute. Second, all items come with white rice. No substitutions. You can purchase a small cup of fried rice for $1.50, but you are still getting a large serving dish of white rice. God help you if you don't eat it all! The judgmental looks I got put me back in the mindset of a preschooler getting lectured about starving Ethiopians for not finishing dinner. 

The dishes are presented in an alluring manner but lack any true substance. I ordered the house chicken, which on the menu boasted a plethora of ingredients. Expecting an orgasm, insert childish laughter here, of subtle and complex flavors; I was surprised when all I could taste was garlic. That's it. It didn't have a hint of poultry, nor a snifter of spice, or even a splash of citrus. Just garlic. On the bright side, I no longer stay awake at night in fear that the kid from Twilight will break through my bedroom window. Not because he played a vampire in a movie, but because all actors are soulless creatures that live off the blood of others and are repelled by garlic. It's just a scientific fact. 

Lastly, I'd like to detail the atmosphere. The entire décor of the restaurant has been well taken care of but appears as if it hasn't been updated since the '80s. The staff, while genuinely courteous, followed too many stereotypes to not be deliberate. Every decision I made was met with a compliment pertaining to my ability or intelligence. No one spoke more than a few words of broken English and all the servers were women. 

I'm just an old chunk of coal. I don't know how to tell authentic Chinese cuisine from that being altered for American tastes. I'm not privy of the social markers indicative to Chinese hospitality. 

I do know when front is being put up. I'm understand that just because someone talks or acts a certain way doesn't mean they are creating traditional delicacy. 

The reason for this front became alarmingly apparent while watching fellow patrons of China Village. The less English a hostess spoke the more they were tipped and the happier the customer appeared. It was an experience for them; especially those over 60. 

The workers and owners of this establishment are merely responding to an economic incentive. People are awarding them for acting a certain way. Maybe this reminds them of 'the good old days' when an Asian American was only from China or Japan. There's a chance customers don't realize they are sending hegemonic messages. Overall, I don't think this is done with some malicious intent in mind, but it's not something I want to support. 

The food here isn't really that tasty, and because I'm not into the pageantry being displayed, there is very little reason for me to come back.I based my review on the pros and cons of the visit that I experienced.

Pros:
1) AMAZING BREAKFAST.  There was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds.  The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.
2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.
3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.

Cons:
1) $5 / day parking fee.
2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there
3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.
4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter
5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.
6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink.Very much in need of a complete overhaul. Rooms are highly dated. When you think of the name Embassy Suites this hotel does not resonate that theme. Price-wise it's at any economy at $89 per night. 

Would not recommend this for a long stay. Anything overnight is probably fine. There's better out there.It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. 

I've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. 

Our food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more "juice" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. 

I've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)Ruth Chris did not meet my expectations.  The food was good but, not excellent and certainly not worth the $200 that the bill came to for one cocktail, 1 appetizer, 2 small steaks, one side and 2 glasses of wine. No complaints about the service or the atmosphere. That was fine. However, for the money, I would go to Donovan's or Omaha Steakhouse.Went in with my wife to upgrade her iPhone 4 to a 5S, having been told over the phone they had them in stock, but couldn't do anything unless we were there in person. We were helped after about 3 minutes by an employee who checked the inventory and verified that they did. He said he'd go get one.

We then stood around for 20-30 minutes waiting, distracting ourselves with the display units in the meanwhile. After this time had passed, we noticed the employee we had spoken with back in the main area helping another customer. We spoke to him and he told us that since they only had a limited inventory, we had to buy it via the website to ensure that the one he grabbed was on gold for someone else.

He called another employee and we were led to a display computer and guided through the order process, which fortunately was pretty straightforward. A few minutes later the other employee got us the phone and we were done.

Why the employee couldn't come back to us to say we had to order one through the site (which would have saved everyone time) is confusing and just bad customer service. We wasted time waiting for him that could have been spent quickly ordering online and having someone else fetch the phone.

2 Stars only because the other employee was helpful speeding us through the online ordering process.Putting a high price tag on a plate does not make it good. 

Service: excellent 
Ambiance: good 

The food was disappointing and overpriced, the ravioli, undercooked, the blue cheese overpowered the rest of the salad. 

No shortage of expensive vehicles carefully positioned by the valet, but I'm afraid that money can't buy you good taste.Let me start by writing that the service was good, the waitress was prompt and attentive to the two of us. We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask . What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was  dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter. My lamb was very good, except that lighting a rosemary twig for no purpose except to fill the room with smoke, is very unappealing and choking , especially when most diners have that dish. How is it a good idea to smoke people out? I think it takes away from he dish. Just put fresh rosemary on the plate , would be much more aromatic. The wine list is extensive and way overpriced( 300% mark up on some wines is unacceptable). I also think a water bottle should be opened at the table and not brought open to the table , makes me wonder .
I would also note that the food plates arrived quickly( which is good) although spending $360.00 and being out of there in 90 minutes can leave one wondering what just happened.
Overall, it is not on my return list.I first discovered the Coffee Lady through a deal website.  I live down the street so I figured I'd check it out, get breakfast and coffee while getting some work done on my laptop.  The breakfast sandwich (egg, ham, cheese, on their AMAZING multi-grain toast) is one of the best I've ever had!  Coffee is so-so, wasn't very strong, but tasted good.

The service is what I have an issue with.  Every time I went there (a total of 3 times) was planning on hanging out for a while.  On my second visit, as I was using my prepaid online deal thing, the Coffee Lady rang me up and I gave her cash for the small difference in price between my certificate and what I owed.  While she was getting change for the cash I gave her I slipped $3 into her tip jar (which she apparently didn't notice-but t doesn't matter anyway!)  and when she handed me 50 cents back, I put that into the tip jar too.  Awkward/uncomfortable/rude service moment next!  She scoffed and commented on how LOW my TIP was!!!  Are you kidding me???  1)  Just because you THINK someone is giving you a low tip, it is SOOOO RUDE to comment on it and try and make them feel bad about it  2) I really DID tip $3 on my coffee and breakfast sandwich and really just wanted to take my $3 right back out of the jar that second.  But I didn't.  I stayed, waited for my food, coffee and left later. 3)  If someone doesn't have extra money to tip you at a walk up coffee shop, it really isn't that big of a deal that you need to make them feel publicly shamed.  

The decor is cute and home-y inside, there are plenty of tables, very unreliable wifi, good breakfast sandwich, bleh coffee and crappy service.Searching for a new primary care physician is difficult.  After the first visit, i loved Mountain View Family Physicians, the staff seemed to know their job description (but not go above it to be friendly), I loved the technology, and the doctors seemed to take that extra moment to chat (which is hard to find these days).  

However, after four visits, two doctors, four blood samples, four urine samples, and over a week and a half to get results back every time, only to hear a submissive "everything seems fine, it should go away with time" each time, I sought a new doctor and was diagnosed with the problem immediately.  

They seem great, but are missing the most important part.This location started out as The Q, has been around for a couple of decades and unfortunately is showing its age. 

I considered giving just one star, but it does seem like they've finally started to update this place by doing stuff like removing the unnecessary upstairs desk and replacing all of the old TVs with modern flat screens.

However, they still need to go a lot further. I wish they would just close down for a week, completely clean, and repaint the entire place with a new color scheme that doesn't give me flashbacks to the 90s. They also need to fix the tile in the sauna and improve the lighting throughout so it doesn't seem so dingy.

Either that or just tear the place down and build a whole new gym.

Honestly, if it wasn't for Mickey's Thursday night yoga class I'm not sure I'd make the effort to come to this location.I do like 24 Hour Fitness as a whole, but service at this location is a problem. Poor staff training? High turnover? Lack of communication? Probably all of the above. 

Upon signing up with 24, I made it clear that I was on the fence between 24 and LA Fitness -- the latter is a block from my house. The sales lady told me that LA Fitness makes you sign a contract and that was the major difference. My fault for not verifying this. It is NOT true. LA Fitness does not lock you in to a contract. Sad that 24 Hour Fitness staff is talking so poorly about their competitors. Just be fair and honest. 

I have personally come in twice looking for information about training (even spoke with a manager one time). There wasn't anyone available either visit. No problem. Left my information and waited. The last time was over two weeks ago. Still no response. I'm assuming their personal trainers are too busy to take on new clients. You'll have to go elsewhere if that's what you're looking for. 

Last week I went to a class on a Thursday evening. But the instructor did not show up. No one on staff knew where she was. Plus you have to pay extra money and sign up ahead of times for certain classes. This isn't noted on their website or on the app. I had no idea until I got out of bed early on a Saturday morning, pumped and motivated, and went to the gym. Sadly I was told I could not attend without preregistering and paying. No idea which classes this rule applies to. The front desk attendant didn't give me much information either, only telling me to try to come half an hour early to get a spot. No thank you. I drove up to the Bell location where they gladly took me with no reservation or fee on a Saturday.

I've learned that if you come in late, like after 9pm, it's dirty. I'm guessing staff is limited at this point. Paper towels and sanitizing spray run out, meaning no one cleans equipment. So gross. 

Thus far, this seems to be the only location that's run so poorly, in my experience. That's what you get with a typical box-style corporate gym I guess.As a vegan for over 10 years, i hate to NOT support a tried and true vegan restaurant in phoenix. But i have to be honest and say that this place did not live up to my expectations. In fact, it fell quite short. I ate at the Glendale Loving Hut location and had a FAR better experience there, so my review here is only for the Phoenix location. By all means, DO go to the Glendale one! It has a different menu and completely different atmosphere.

The phoenix location on Indian School Road has a very drab interior, and very outdated. White metal chairs that looked like they were from the '80s. My first impression walking in was not a good one, and that is important to me. Definitely not a soothing relaxing atmosphere by any means. Also, there was a bad odor in the air. Almost smelled fishy to me. It almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest. 

Ok, now on to the food. I got the Grilled Teryaki dish. By the way, did i mention prices are also higher at this location? $9.00 was the cost of this dish -- for lunch! Prices are a couple dollars less at the Glendale spot. Anyways, the faux meat in this dish was fine -- nothing to write home about, but it was "good". However, my complaint is that is ALL it was. Just a big pile of fake meat, and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetables on the side with no sauce or marinades on them. Just plain vegetables, and they were getting colder by the minute. Not really what i had in mind for lunch and certainly not worth the $9.00 plus the tip. I guess i should have gotten the rice to go with it all, but that was extra money!

The complimentary lentil soup was a nice touch, but i've had better lentil soup that i've made myself. The soup too was only lukewarm, and very small cup size portion.

The only positive i can say is that the waitress was wonderful and very friendly. I feel bad writing a bad review, but honesty is my policy.This place is affordable, and the eye doc is awesome. Very personable, very nice, maybe a little quick in his examination - or maybe he is just that good, I don't know. So far so good, and I would come back for the eye doctor alone. 

The rest of the organization is unorganized and not very welcoming. I felt like I tried to use a coupon in an eastern European country. I didn't have a coupon. The coupon was imaginary. Stop saying coupon. 

When I picked my glasses up, I tried them on immediately in the store. The right lens was good, while the left was way way off. I couldn't see a thing. I told the lady behind the counter and she said that it was just me having to get adjusted to my new glasses. I, not being an idiot, told her that it was nothing that I could get used to and that they have done something wrong. This sparked a fire of hatred in said eastern European lady, but she kept it professional.. well kinda, and said that they would look into it. I suspected that I would never see my awesome retro RayBan frames again.

But I did a week later. This time I could see with both my eyes, which was intended to begin with and I was happy. However, I will not be getting lenses from this establishment again.Did a late dinner run last night just before closing. Been to several of this chains locations in California which means I generally like the Hawaiian food fixes that they serve up. Ordered kalbi ribs and they gave me the ribs but no meat attached!  When I questioned them about it they acted offended however the manager finally came by and provided me with a few more bones. Rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile. Definitely not Ono!This place is just okay. Almost all the sauces (even the guacamole) are watered-down and they aren't shy about using a microwave right in front of the customers; it's right behind the front counter, and I watched a guy nuke my nachos & cheese before topping them off. If you can overlook these things, this place is all right; certainly better than Del Taco or Taco Bell or anything like that in that at least they cut their own produce and don't have a manufactured taste. Not the best for you, but if you're thinking about eating here or at any Mexican-style restaurant around, you probably aren't super-interested in being health-conscious, anyway.Staff is unhelpful, they acted like I was an inconvenience to them.  The fax machine erred and I had to fight to have my price adjusted to the correct amount.Last night I had the infortunate experience of dining at T.Cook's fine restaurant.
The ambiance and the setting were truly enchanting. Unfortunately the magic stops right there. The dining experience could only be qualified as very disappointing. I had ordered the Lobster entree. I was presented with a very small piece of lobster
surrounded with sparse and unidentifiable elements. The whole entree tasted at best bland.  Were it not for the presence of a fine and delightful company, I would have endured a very sad evening indeed. For desert I had : chocolate decadence which was good but surely not good enough to offer any solace to this indescript botched entree.
So stay away from this overpriced establishment which does in no way qualify as a fine gourmet dining venue. The two generous stars I have given for atmosphere and setting, let us be fair...Thanksgiving dinner at $75 per head was very disappointing last evening.  The food was just average at best.  The food was bland and uninspired.  We will not return here.T Cook's used to be our favorite place for weekend breakfast - we went about 2-3 times a month.  The frittata was one of the best - bar none.  We were excited to go back today after their summer long renovation.  They've done a nice job on the interior, it looks great.
Despite the restaurant not being even close to full, our party of 4 were seated right next to the kitchen door.  Thus began our experience.
$12 for the pancakes was ok - until they came.  3 flat pancakes with a drizzle of syrup, no fruit, nothing else on the plate.  Their pancakes use to be a fluffy stack with a delicious blueberry compote, my husband could barely finish it.  This new pancake plate was lifeless and left him hungry.
Another diner ordered oatmeal, came cold, she did not enjoy.
The frittata came full of mushrooms, which surprised me - weren't listed on the menu or I wouldn't have ordered, don't like.  Server happily took it and brought me a new one, he was very nice about it.  The new one was fine, nothing compared to the old but that might just be my preferences of flavors.
The breakfast panini was fine.
I do not like giving only 2 stars to what was one of our favorite places but the food just wasn't there for us.
The service was excellent.  Everyone from the valet to the hostess, to our server and young man doing water and clearing plates was pleasant and attentive.  
The new bar looks fun, we'll be back to try it out but might have to cross of our list of places we love for breakfast.I generally enjoy eating at Einstein's. It's a good tasting, quick, and fairly priced meal. The shmears are good, the bagels are fresh, and the sandwiches are filling. So, I must let you know this review applies only to this Einstein's.

I've come here quite a few times, but finally decided to write a review because I'm sick of the mistakes - it needs to be said. At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.

I've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.

However, there is one shining star - Cathrin. If everybody made your order as quickly or perfectly as her, this place would be getting a much higher rating from me.

So, if you are going to this location, I warn you. Some of the employees don't pay attention.I LOVE the look of Tammie Coe's vibrantly colored fondant masterpieces. I LOVE the ooey gooey icing. I LOVE the moistness in the red velvet cupcake.

HERE'S WHAT I REALLY, REALLY DON'T LIKE:

I had a Zebra cake for my 22nd birthday from LGO made by Tammie Coe. I was pleased with the whole shebang. For my graduation from nursing school, my mom decided to order me a specially made cake from Tammie Coe's. She requested "jewel tone" colors; emerald green, deep blueberry purple, and a garnet like color. The lady who helped her was rude, cold, and short. She told her to "remember that this is fondant, and those aren't jewel tones, jewels don't come in those colors." My mom just urged that they make sure they are rich, deep colors because those are my daughters favorites. Welp, I picked up a lime green, hot pink, and baby lavendar cake.

AND AS IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH:

My mom paid extra to have a stethoscope and graduation cap placed on top of the cake. There were obvious thumb prints all over the stethoscope and the silver from the stethoscope was smeared all over the top of the cake. When I got home I took out my painter's brushes, cleaned off a fan brush, and then meticulously cleaned up their mess with water and patience. As they should have done.

For the price, I'd expect the Tammie Coe staff to be respectful and courteous to all of their customers, but especially to my mother. Furthermore, the work should not be sloppy and the color should be what was ordered. 

Tammie Coe did not deliver.ughh......Ive been an LGO promoter for 10 years....no longer.  they had an excellent product when they featured tammie coe bakery goods.  the new internally baked products are just not to the same standard.......continuing the downward slide.It almost seems pointless to review a big box retail store, but I have issue with this location and how my items ring up.  I will use yesterday as a short but accurate example:

I went to purchase a picture frame with my daughter.  We bought this and 3 spontaneous purchases.  The 3 additional purchases were frivolous and cheap, however it was the bright red SALE sign that attracted to me to these items.  And, at the register, none of them rang up at the advertised sale price.

Supposedly the popcorn was on sale for $2.50. It rang up at the normal price of $3.29.  The watermelon oreos, which everyone has claimed are gross but are surprisingly good, were on sale for $2.80, but rang up for $3.  And lastly, I bought some sour patch flavored gum, on clearance at the register for 60-cents, yet rang up for .99 cents.

YES, THEY DO HAVE SOUR PATCH FLAVORED GUM.

I didn't say anything at the register because I am not going to hold up a line over an extra $1.29 total.  Nor am I going to waste my time standing in customer service to embarrass myself over $1.29.  But, the problem is that this is exactly what Target expects from us.  They basically overcharge ALL OF US every time we shop there.  Sure, in minimal amounts, but does that make it right?

It was Sunday so  it is very conceivable that this particular store simply did not update their sale advertisements throughout the store and it's more of an issue with location rather Target itself.  Hence the yelp review.

Since they have sour patch flavored gum and watermelon oreos (and yes, I realize I  have taste buds like a 6 year old), I will probably return anyway.  Just be wary of the sale signs - they mean nothing.My friend and I decided to meet up on Sunday to catch up and decided on Postino's because of their day time drink specials and their Sangira Sunday deal.  I know they are a busy place so I went a few minutes early to grab a table since my friend was driving from N Scottsdale.  

The Hostess was friendly and told me it would be a 15 min wait for a table so I headed to the bar to grab a drink.  15 minutes pass and I see others that came in after me being seated.  20 minutes pass and I ask the hostess how much longer it would be.  She told me that she couldn't seat me because the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet.  I said yes I am waiting on 1 other person but I came early to get a table while she drove down.  The hostess told me they were busy and can't let people just hold tables all day for their friends.  She rudely said she would seat me now since I complained and lead me over to 2 lounge chairs with 2 wobbly end tables pushed together to make a table.  The idea was cute but made for an awkward eating experience since I was leaning forward and bending down to enjoy eating my lunch.  I had specifically asked for a table so I wasn't sure if we got seated at this table because I had complained as there were other more eating friendly tables available.

The whole ordeal was very off putting so my friend and I stayed for a bit and then went to another restaurantSuch a happening place with so little service.  Lots of neighborhood restaurants pour your bottle of wine for the table and refresh glasses. Similar establishments, with great ambience, also ask if you would would like another bottle. This Postino's service does not and their bottles aren't cheap. 

Granted, plenty of servers milling around.  Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.

I guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?

There were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey! It's 60 degrees, brr.)

Butcher block is always a highlight and I won't give up on this fun place just yet. It simply needs some good floor management.went on June 8th with some girlfriends
we sat at end of bar due to 25 min wait for table.
Waiter had a condescending way of saying "you are going to eat here"?  
Then later everyone got food except me, he said I did not order and I know I ordered first. The girls were confused about what to order so I also helped them choose and he said he thought I was sharing with them. He asked if I wanted to order, first I said no and then decided I would.
Here is what ticked me off ..he said" I thought I would step back until you realized the stupid thing you said" I couldn't believe he would say that and from then on his service was absent.
food was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ....I want to like it more, I really do.Wings were OK. Liked the Yella Pilsner draft special. Decent dive bar. Real good ranch!I've been searching for a decent take out Chinese place for awhile, and there are a few in this area. This hap pend to be the first one I tried, and maybe ordering the traditional take out dishes was the downfall, but I was disappointed. 

My girlfriend and I ordered beef with snow peas and water chestnuts, and a spicy vegetable kung pao type thing with fried rice. The flavor, quality, and freshness of the ingredients was very bland and seemed to be more of a public cafeteria type quality. The menu had a number of specialty dishes, so maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out.The food wasn't very good. My girlfriend and I could only eat like a quarter of meal before we asked for a boxes (just to be nice, we don't plan on eating them). We then drove across the street to McDonalds.  I would like to note the waiter was super nice but that doesn't really help later when your stomach hurting. I hope it was just the dishes we ordered (spicy chicken w/ red sauce and chicken with vegetables in spicy sauce) because ironically the restaurant ambiance was very cozy and all the staff was extremely nice.I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.

The staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again.Looked at the rating and thought it would be exciting....but nothing at all special.  The huevos rancheros SUCKED.  Very bland, nothing great at all.  We also got some dish that was mushrooms, cheese and spinach on a bialy (but they were out so it was on a english muffin)  not bad.  But for like $10 I and tons of good reviews, I would expect more than just tortillas from a bag on the side of over easy eggs and like 2 pieces of avocado.I went there with my girlfriend on Friday night and had a pretty underwhelming experience. To start with, service was far too leisurely. Our server disappeared for ten minutes between every interaction right up until the final twenty minute wait to get our bill. The decor and vibe was a little uptight and there was no music. The lack of music and the half-filled restaurant set the stage for periods of awkward silence that made me yearn for the cool vibrant atmosphere of a Houston's. 

Here are the dishes we ordered with a small commentary and star ranking.
Grilled Artichoke - Swimming in oil and just tasted of grilled olive oil *
Veal Osso Buco - The veal is not bad but it was served with bland rice pilaf **
Lamb Shank - Not bad; tender braised lamb and onions on some bland spaghetti***
Spaghetti Bolognese - The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce tasted good but the pool of oil on the bottom of the plate made for an unappetizing finish. ***
Escargot - They tasted fine but they just seemed old-fashioned. They tasted just like the garlic butter escargot I had on a cruise ship in 1988. **Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here.I was excited about this place after reading all of the great reviews, but this place didn't live up to the expectations.  I ordered a Cheddar Burger and a Vienna Hot Dog.  The burger was awful; it had no flavor whatsoever.  In-N-Out blows this place out of the water, which is kind of pathetic because that's just fast food.  The hot dog was better than the burger, but it was just average.  I'm not sure that this place is worth returning to.I thought I try out Thai Lahna based on the many positive reviews.  This would be my first time to sample Thai food. Meh is how I would descibe the food. So it looks like I won't be booking any vacations to Thailand anytime soon. My wife and I ordered noodles with shrimp, Kung Pao chicken and pork barbeque for take out ($32). The food was bland and flavorless in my opinion.Ordered lunch special at $7.95. Foods not that good, I had No.7 with Beans and meat. It seem to be missing something in flavoring. Maybe MSG or something. The meat tasted precooked but the beans was ok. The spring roll needs more fillings and more flavors. The service was ok but waitress didn't come by to ask for refill. The best part was the rice and the clear soup with strips of wonton.I used to be a huge Pei Wei fan, but the past few times we've gone there--especially last time-- I've been EXTREMELY disappointed. 
I go to Pei Wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. We usually order for lunch, so their lunch combos were always great because they came with an eggroll or spring roll. But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors.. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint... MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too. Super disappointing. 
This place is way too pricy and now that they've essentially eliminated the ONLY thing I like there... they can close up shop as far as I'm concerned.
I'd prolly eat here again if it was thee LAST place open and McDonald's has exploded. But for now, if I never eat here again, it'll be too soon.I was at 3K since my last oil change and I knew I had driven past this place a few times (I'm new to the area).

So I drive up and dude is  all in my face asking if I want the signature service and he goes on to explain it and I ask how much it is and he says 37.99.  I say I just want an oil change and he says it will still be 37.99.  I then say well I think I'll just go somewhere else that's pretty expensive.  He says how about  $10 off and I agree.

They do their thing.  The guy brings me out to go over everything.  Your right lisence plate light is out do you want that fixed?  No.  Your wipers are looking pretty bad do you want us to replace those?  No.  We have this fuel cleaning blah blah?  No.  We tested your battery and you need a new batter.  How much is that?  $106.  Not at this time.  Your air filter looks ok do you want a new one?  No.  Do you want premium, high temp oil?  No just regular oil.  We recommend getting your tired rotated ever 2 oild changes do you want that?  No.  We recommend getting transmission fluid flush every 30k miles do you want that?  No..... 

Oh then I'm driving on the highway and they didn't close my hood all the way tight so I had to pull off and slam it.

I just wanted a simple oil change and left alone.  I like when I can stay in the car and be out of there in 5 minutes not a sales pitch.I came here for an oil change after not being able to make it in time for another Jiffy Lube location nearby and felt as though I was of inconvenience to the employee that "greeted" me there.  I got here about 30 min to closing, and as I am pulling up the "greeter" raises up his arms as in frustration and immediately tells me its a "45 minute wait," which I was ok with.  He tells me quickly after, it'll be more like an "hour wait" which was still OK with me.  I did not feel quite welcome, although he did give me the usual welcome routine, "there's the coffee, the bathroom, if you need anything... Etc." which did not feel genuine.  I would certainly not come back to this location for the unwelcoming environment.I should start off by saying that we have taken the kids ice skating a few times at the Alltel ice den in N. Scottsdale.  A friend said we should try this place because it is a lot less crowded, which sounded nice because the open skate at the ice den can be chaotic and too crowded.  I should also say that I really wanted to like this place.  When we got there, it was not very clear where we pay for open skate and rent the skates.  We finally figured out that you have to go into the shop, so we went in and there was only one worker who was helping someone pick out skates, we had to wait a long time before she could ring us up to skate.  Then she didn't tell us where to go to get our skates, I had to ask her.  She pointed where to go, then she said she would be right there.  Is this a one-man operation??  So, again, we had to wait for her to come around.  The ice skates were in horrible condition, in my opinion, they seemed 30 years old!! We also rented some trainers for the kids.  (I couldn't believe we had to pay $5 each for them, they were made out of pvc pipe!!)
The ice was incredibly choppy and was hard to skate on and the place was just kind of yucky.  The only good thing I can say about it is that there weren't a lot of people, but I can see why!  I really don't think it's any cheaper than the ice den, in fact, their trainers definitely cost more and are way less sturdy.  Even though the ice den is more crowded, we will go there next time...We went for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We had been several times before and the food was memorable. This evening it was nothing like our previous experience. The dishes were all lacking flavor. I ordered the ravioli which I was so looking forward to and I was extremely disappointed. It was lacking flavor and was no where near the tasty dish I remembered from before. We also ordered the clam and muddle appetizer which tasted like rubber doused in water. We left spending $150 and wishing we went to Hillstone or another restaurant for our special evening out.Hit or miss. You have to be there at lunch or dinner rush to get fresh food that hasn't sat and dried out all day. They will usually make fresh food for you if you ask and are wiling to wait, so that's a plus. The fact that you HAVE to ask is NOT a plus, because they do not have a problem giving you a dried out nasty scoop of yuck if that's all that's in the pan. 

All of the negative reviews do not surprise me. I once found a piece of broken glass in my Beijing Beef, about the size of a grain of rice. Nearly ate it but felt it at the last second. 

That being said, it's a long steam table in a cruddy shopping plaza.  I'm not expecting gourmet food here. I am usually happy with what I get, especially if I get them when stuff is fresh. It is what it is.Quality control seems to have disappeared here.  The crust is a disaster these days... and they're really slow... 45 minutes is too long to wait for a casual, mom & pop pizza joint.The food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland.  That makes this an ok place because most anybody could eat what they serve without any complaints.  It is a good place to take a family or for a big eater.  You get food and lots of it.  It kind of makes me think of pigs when you see them at a feeding trough.  What they get may not be good, but they walk away full, happy piggys.  Carlos O'briens sends out lots of happy oinkers!

Did you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).

I debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.  I'd rather be positive than negative so they get three.My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. 
Once the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.Had Spinato's for take out last night. Good service... Ordered the sausage thin crust. The bottom of the crust wasn't very good, could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me.Not really impressed. Food was below average, in my opinion. Chips were just extra greasy, salsa watered down, meals without much taste. Yes, the patio is pretty cool and I imagine that on a busy night this is the place to be, but really, not impressed.

Could be because I had a 13 hour workday, still had food poisoning, and just wanted to be home instead of off for business, but this didn't really make my mood change for the better. Guess that if I was boozing it up it'd be more fun, but then again, what place isn't more fun while boozing it up?Nice and accommodating wait staff. That was about it. Parking is weird. The front entrance is not where the parking lot is. It's on a side street. Then when you walk in you have to keep your kids from putting their hands in the algae filled fountain. I think the goldfish live off algae. They do wedding receptions there if you're into that sort of thing. The salsa and chips are overrated. The carne asada burrito was horrible. It tasted like charred asada. The kids liked the kids menu, but I've definitely had much better Mexican food. Please clean the algae filled fountain. Goldfish deserve better!Atmosphere is fun; food no different than Mexican restaurants elsewhere (even Boston - Borders Cafe has better food). The chips might have been the worst we have had. We were expecting more given all the hype. And all the other reviews. Since this seems to be a chain, maybe we just had a bad experience at this specific one.Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come backThis food is Americanized Chinese food-- not challenging, not different, and certainly not offensive to the American pallet. The food tends to be very salty (which Americans tend to like). It is dependable pedestrian food, the place is noisy, the parking lot crowded. 

There are better places to eat Chinese than any of the Pei Wei's in my opinion.So disappointing.  I do not know what happened to this place... it has progressively gotten worse over time.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good.  It was okay- but just not as good as usual.

The 2 star is for my dish and the zero stars are for my fiance's soppy noodle mess called Chicken lo mein--- ewwwwwwwwww!  I think Ramen noodles tasted better and cost only 11 cents.  They were so mooshy that they barely could stay on the fork-- really gross.  They were tasteless.  We threw it out.  


Pei Wei-- I miss the good times.I went in to buy two different hiking boots for different types of hikes coming up this month. I walked in and was greeted as I walked back to the boots area. There was already someone being service and I looked around waiting my turn. After about 30 mins I walked out. I would have stayed if the person manning the boot area would have acknowledged me to let me know I would be next. Instead I walked around in the small area, surely making the other customer upset.

I understand the limited staff to maximize profit, but they have to have a way to let a customer wander around the store, while still being "in line" to purchase boots. Maybe if the attendant said "I will come find you when we're done" or take a number.: I really wish there were a nursery that could compete w/ their tree selection.  It became apparent after they planted our three fruit trees a few months ago that they'd injured the apple tree w/ a giant pole they drove through the roots (to keep the trunk straight, they said, unlike the apple tree we'd purchased there the previous year and planted ourselves.  Irony?  We'd chosen that apple, and it was curved when we bought it.  Furthermore, they were only supposed to plant the other two trees.  If we'd have planted the new apple, as planned, it wouldn't be struggling to survive, right now).

More than anything, the experience reminds me to be assertive and complain about terrible service, and to look elsewhere before buying any more trees from these people.Eh, to be honest, as much fun as I had partying with my fellow Yelpers on Sunday, I can't give this place a sparkling review.  As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.

Went there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as "the place to watch the big game," they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.

For starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!

This is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.

This is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!

Needless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.

After the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.

We had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.

I am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.

As long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...Ordered a takeout order online to be ready at 7:55 show up at 8:00 to pick it up and they were just putting it in the oven... It was ready at 8:20. They didn't even apologize. Overpriced for such bad service. I won't be eating here again.As you can see, I have eaten at BC many many times. Have always ignored the fact that the inside is dirty because the food has been good and cheap. But recently the filth in the place really has grossed me out and I cannot overlook roaches and bugs. The owner is a nice enough guy, but has no clue how to properly run a restaurant. The food is hit or miss now. Sad.In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bumpI'm The Duke of one of the worst Safeway's in town?

This is the closest grocery to my home.  I've been going here for years.  It serves it's purpose but it's by no means glamorous.  If you need the bare necessities this will suit you just fine, otherwise I'd go across the street to AJ's!2 stars from the vegan perspective. Why? Because they don't have much of any vegan food.

1) The pizza sauce contains cheese
2) The marinara sauce contains cheese
3) Their margarine contains whey
4) Their pasta contains egg or milk

So PLEASE start offering a vegan entrée and some vegan marinara sauce SoNY! Maybe some whole wheat pasta too?

I would like to take this opportunity to complement and praise our amazing server Andrea. She is so awesome! She happily took the time to check on all of the items and dish ingredients for us to find out if they were vegan (or most often, not). Amazing customer service!

We wound up eating the following:
Custom made passion bread with no garlic butter or cheese. We had it brushed with olive oil and added some oregano. We then made an olive oil + balsamic + oregano dip.
A salad with their Italian dressing.
A small pizza with no cheese, no sauce, veggies + pineapple & olive oil added as a base.

Their passion bread (made from pizza crust) is super delicious but it really sucked that we couldn't dip in some marinara.I wish that I could have got ahold of Sherry's Pampered Pets so that I could have made the reservation that I needed. But after 2 attempts at contacting them by phone and leaving them a voicemail that never got returned, I never even got as far as making the reservation. I waited 3-4 days for a return phone call, and then made reservations elsewhere. If I can't even get ahold of anyone or get a return phone call after leaving a voicemail, I am sure not leaving my dog with you.So, I'm driving from SEA to PHX with my 65-year grandmother who manages to invite herself into my 06' Saab 9-3 for my 1500 mile journey to my new home. I should've known better than to let her drive! She was hauling ass, really enjoying herself, blurting out such things as "I feel so young again!" and "I love going fast!" Although, she made me nervous, I also enjoyed seeing her happy, so I allowed it to persist until she hits a HUGE pot hole going 70mph in a 50mph. 

Bam! $800 Anti-lock Brake System repair.

When I took the Saab into get it fixed the service was fantastic. They were very helpful. They even had this old man drive me back to work. He was a creepy old man. It was so funny. "The best part about college are the cute horny girls." Ummm. Ok. Old man. TMI. 

Anyway, so they diagnosed the car, "fixed it," cleaned my car inside out, and delivered it to me! Great, right?! Wrong. The car was returned with the engine light on and the gentleman who delivered the car said nothing. So I begin to drive and the car doesn't accelerate. Its driving like an effing golf cart. Pretty comical, but I wasn't happy. I call the service dept, they agreed to scan the car for free if I brought it back in, but were not convinced there was anything wrong. So I took the car in and it appears they didn't finish the repair! Once they scanned the car's computer they immediately knew where to look. The guy pops the hood, and boom various pipes are not clamped down and the air sensors are not attached. Lund Saab, really?

They were clearly embarrassed and I forgive them for not knowing how to apologize. They did give me a new gas tank cap after it came up on the scanner because mine had been recalled, which I guess I'm supposed to be feel happy about except for the fact they should have fixed it with the initial repairs! In the end, I'm not happy with their lack of detail, which is why you pay top dollar, right?Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!

The chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!

Miguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!I too found them on Rosie and have used them two times. First I have to say that the staff is very nice and the technician is a great guy. The first time I used them I was in a bind and my aircon was dead in July. The price was very steep for the job but I paid. The second time I had a furnace that was not working. I troubleshot the problem and the technician came out who agreed with me that the ignitor was bad. I was quoted that this part would cost $317. I was in shock since an ignitor is nothing more than a rod with wires that heats up for the furnace to ignite, no rocket science. I shopped around and found a new factory part from Carrier for less than $45. I installed the part and works just fine. 

I realize that price mark-up is how a lot of companies make their money but this is truly gross misconduct and really uncalled for. Now I want to be clear the staff is awesome and this is why I gave them 2 stars but in this economy and with a Rosie rating I am very disappointed.I debated on reviewing this place after my initial visit and thought it wasn't worth it. About 7 months later I had an experience with them again and realized my initial suspicions about them were correct. 

Last year I was diagnosed with cancer in my neck & the surgeon who did my biopsy referred me to this place kind of out of nowhere. I had gone to see him on a Thursday for a follow-up (for what was most likely going to be the last time for awhile) & that Monday I was set to start chemotherapy. He thought it was a good idea to see an ENT thinking maybe they could add something to my diagnosis and/or treatment. I thought it was odd to do this so last minute (If I wasn't able to see the ENT the next day...which I was, I even asked my surgeon if he thought I should delay chemo until after I saw the ENT, but he didn't think that was necessary). He was pretty insistent that I go to THIS ENT office. My dad had just got done seeing an ENT for a throat condition, which he (and I) really liked, but my surgeon said he "never heard of him" and REALLY wanted me to go to this office (I looked up info on then ENT my dad saw and he has a very good reputation).

I saw Dr. Bailey the following morning. Honestly, I thought he was a good doctor based on the initial exam I had with him. He was thorough & very personable. Since my appointment was scheduled so quickly he didn't have a whole lot of information going in and said he would consult my surgeon and get back to me. I never heard from his office again, but honestly, I didn't think much of it. I was starting chemo and was focused on that. Unless one of my doctors felt it was absolutely necessary to have an ENT involved with my treatment I was fine with never dealing with this office again (not because of Dr. Bailey, like I said, he seemed good) but I already had enough going on with chemo & eventually radiation. 

That being said, I thought the manner in which I was scheduled to come into this office in the first place (and then never hearing from them again) was kind of tacky & it came across like they were just looking for any reason out there to bring in patients (I also understand that my surgeon also shares some responsibility here).

Well, with chemo & radiation complete I recently had a follow-up with my oncologist and he asked about all the doctors I had seen throughout this whole ordeal. He brought up Dr. Bailey (along with my other doctors), and at first I couldn't even remember who that was since I had only seen him the one time. When I said I only saw him once and that was before I started chemo, my oncologist said since technically I DID see him the one time during this whole process he would fax him my latest report (along with all my other doctors). 

Yesterday I get a phone call from Entegrity saying my oncologist wanted me to come into their office for a follow-up. I thought this was odd since he never mentioned this to me at my last visit (or called me afterwards to tell me this) so I told them I wanted to contact my oncologist's office before scheduling anything (and find out WHY he would want me to schedule something with an ENT). It turns out that he simply faxed them my report (like he said he was going to do), but never mentioned anything about coming back to them for a follow-up. My oncologist's assistant also seemed confused as to why this office wanted me to come back in after 7 months. If the ENT thought there was a reason to come back in based on my oncologist's report that's one thing, but to say my oncologist asked them to schedule me when he didn't is tacky.

All this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this office comes across desperate for patients. Like I said, I thought Dr. Bailey was good based on my brief encounter with him (which is why I'm willing to give this place a 2nd star). However, I would never come back here...This Bashas is really annoying. Not much for selection and I have often bought expired items. The self check out stations have a goal in life to piss you off and waste your time. 

Trying to buy a card? Put it on the scanner and wait, because obviously that card is a fruit of some sort.

In a hurry? 5 items won't scan and the helper is nowhere in sight.

Feel something dripping down your leg? That's right sucker, the soy milk you are about to purchase has a hole in it. 

I go because it is the closest to the house and sometimes it is to dang hot to drive all the way to the blingy Fry's on Tatum.Not really impressed with David's Bridal overall, we mainly only come here because the bridesmaids dresses are so cheap. I guess my expectation of someone owning a bridal shop or hiring people that work there, would actually be happy for the brides-to-be, but most of them seem like they loathe their jobs. Maybe they deal with too many bridezillas, but whatever the reason, when someone comes in and you work in retail and they are polite to you, you should just be polite back. The level of service is not that great. They seem very rushed to get you in and out as quickly as possible while doing the least they can to help you before moving onto the next customer. We called to try to schedule an appointment for bridesmaids dress shopping, but I didn't receive a call back so we just stopped in and ended up buying one of them. Then I got a call about a week ago (after already ordering my dress) to schedule the appointment. And they couldn't understand that I wasn't the bride, but merely shopping for my bridesmaid's dress for my sister's wedding. We were told it would take about 2-3 weeks to get the dress in, and I never got a call about it arriving. I had to call them, plus they even have a note on the receipt that if you don't pick it up within a certain amount of time, they will send it back. Good thing I called, because my dress had been in already and we never received a call. The girl that helped me when I came in was polite, but looked annoyed that she had to get up off her chair to run to the back to get my dress. Good thing it's cheap there, otherwise I'm not really sure how any David's Bridal stays in businesswe opened several accounts here at desert schools because they are a credit union not a bank

what i don't care for is the cold environment
the staff are friendly enough and knowledgeable
services will do 

the environment though is more cold than one of the big banking institutions

i like they are local to arizona though so we'll stay!I generally like Walmart far more than I should and defend their sourcing ethics and quality far more than I'd like - that said, there are some real jerks working at this particular Wal-Mart, including the cart caretaker, the frozen foods produce wench, and the dude haphazardly chucking heads of lettuce into a bin to ensure their short shelf life.  

Don't get me wrong folks, I know your job sucks, but at leas try not to make the customers shopping with you feel bad about their decisions.I don't know if it was just a bad day or a bad waiter but I didn't enjoy my visit. Arrived for lunch at 1:26pm and was seated immediately. My fiancé and I ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad and it came out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees (crab stuffed Tilapia) when we received the appetizer. We sat and sat and sat. We were talking and when we realized we didn't have out food we called the waiter (who never came to the table after seating us and delivering the appetizers) he said the food was just done and coming out. An hour later. Needless to say the food was cold which means it was done and left sitting and the waiter didn't provide prompt service. I'm sorry we won't be coming back here. Very bad experience.Bleh.  

Our service was pretty bad...food took forever to come out, waiter got our drinks wrong and was overall unattentive.  

Once the food finally arrived it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I had the cobb salad and my friend had the chicken sandwhich, both pretty average, although portions were big.  

Note that you have to order sides like fries seperate--which annoys me.  Cheesy decorations...blah blah blahI remember when I thought Abercrombie was totally BA. I spent weeks trying to convince either one of my parents to take me there so I could buy a hat with a hula dancer on it and maybe even a sweater with a line through it. 

Eventually, one of them caved, probably because of my birthday, and spent way too much money on way too few clothes. 

At some point I figured out that Abercrombie was actually completely lame. I don't know if its my tastes that have changed, or their clothes, but in either case I have no plans of dropping in to A and F anytime soon.I put in an order in early April, was told by Angela that I would have a proof the next day.  2 days later I called back looking for my proof, was told I'd get a call back the next day, still nothing.  1 week later I called yet again looking for the proof, Angela said I would get a call back that day, nothing.  Finally yesterday I received a proof for the wrong type of sign, I asked them to correct it, they then sent me the correct type of sign, but with the wrong name and wrong phone number.

They do get 2 stars instead of 1 because I've used them in the past and they do make a quality sign.  I don't mind waiting as long as I'm given an accurate estimate.  Also Josh really is a nice guy, he just needs some additional help.If you are looking for cheap frames that are made in China(most of them) - perfect store for you. Most of the frames look alike with very little variety. We ordered sunglasses for my daughter that she can use during sports - they had to send it out. When we ordered - they said it'll be about a week & they'll call us when it comes back. 2 weeks later - haven't heard a thing from them & when I called them, I was told they were in their "call tray".

They are terribly understaffed, always have to wait forever to get any service but they are nice.

If you are looking for decent quality & variety of frames and want prompt service - do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!!!Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service. 

I called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said "Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?" No, you can't. 

Definitely won't be going back to this location.So I've come here multiple times. I think the only reason I come here is for the Horchata drink to be honest because it's made by a machine (not them). They take FOOOREEEVVVERRRR to get my food. This is supposed to be fast food. Quick! I'm not in a full service restaurant that I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. The place in the kitchen is a dump. I know since they leave the door open on my way to the restrooms (which you should stay away from). Chemicals next to prep table (near food!!!)  NO BUENO!  Meat was sitting out in the back. I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

 They have terrible, terrible service. It is always a girl with no uniform wearing regular unprofessional clothing . I'm not judgmental, but she has bracelets and rings on. When you work in food service, you are NOT allowed to have jewelry anywhere near your hands. She could pass on germs and bacteria from the jewelry onto the food. Ok fine. But when someone touches their face and hair and then goes back in the kitchen without washing her hands? I kind of shutter. I've worked in restaurants for so long, that it's just hard for me to NOT notice bad hygienic practices even if to the average person, seems pretty picky. Hey, at least i know the Maricopa County Food Code!

She always takes my order like, "Ugh, I can't text and I have to take your order????" 

I once ordered tacos and it was filled with guacamole. Don't get me wrong I love guacamole, but when I order carne asada tacos, I want to taste the meat, too! So I told the girl, excuse me but...these are waaay overpowered by guacamole. She says "sorry, I cant make you new ones." WHAT? Seriously? You served me bad food, and I came here for a decent meal. She said, "do you want me to pick off the avocado? Well, actually, you can do it yourself?"  Well.Okaaaaay? Thanks....I'll eat disappointed. I don't know why I deal with terrible places that don't care about the customer. I think it's just become it's the norm with fast food. Anyway, it's not really worth coming here.To begin with, the only reason this place gets 2 stars is because it has Dunkin Donuts that my children like to eat before I allow them to play in the (usually dirty) play area. 
I took my car there today thinking the bad service I received last time was just a bad day for everyone. I wish I had not given them a second chance. I went because I wanted an oil change and car wash. No, I don't want my transmission fluid flushed. No, I don't want my coolant system flushed. No, I do not want you to replacement my windshield wipers. No, I do not want you to rotate my tires. No, I do not like Green Eggs and Ham. I find it extremely frustrating to have someone try to up-sell me on a constant basis, even when you were suppose to start work on my truck 20 minutes prior. I don't appreciate being mocked when I say that the extra $80 you want to charge me today is not in my budget. I do not appreciate having my window broken because they accidentally knocked it off track because the idiots locked my keys in the car... twice. Their cashiers are bitchy and all their stuff is over priced.
Save your self the hassle, don't use Cobblestone.This place has AWESOME prices and tacos BUT the service really sucks. I know its a dive bar but I wish they would do a better job at training the servers and bartenders. There is NO greeting when you enter, I've sat at a table for 10 mins before someone asked how they can help me. The waitress passed me up 3 TIMES before serving me. HORRIBLE! However, the prices (Happy Hour) keep bringing me back and I've learned, piss on the waitresses, go to the bar and order your drinks and food, it still may take awhile but definitely a lot faster than waiting on a waitress.We ate here last night.  I was disappointed with the almost everything.  The food was just OK.  Nothing was bad but nothing had me excited at all.  The menu was small even for a Mid-eastern restaurant.  Seating was awkward because you are right next to the isles of food in the market.  I would not go back.Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.

I went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a "taco stand" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place. 

 I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.

My Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene.Do they have everything a hardare store should have?

Yep.

However.... try 'returning' anything there and you get major pushback from the staff.

The guys working the floor are helpful.  The cashiers are rather rude.

Only two stars because Home Depot is only 2 miles north and  I would rather make the short drive than put up with the attitude.

"Attitude" in a Hardware Store....  "go figure."OK, this is going to be long but I've wanted to post a review on Ulta many, many times and I am finally getting around to it. 

I am not a fan in Ulta in general, but especially this location. Items are not well-organized here and I often spend a lot of time hunting for things when they are not where I expect to find them. For example, if something is on display (esp. drug store brands), they place it at the end of a shelf or in a middle aisle instead of where the rest of the items in that brand are found. Specials are misleading (e.g. buy one get one 1/2 off doesn't count for sale or clearance items but the fine print doesn't say that). I've been overcharged several times where I didn't find out until I got home that the sale price didn't come up on the register. The sales staff are incredibly rude. I always have to hunt them down to ask a question and when they are gossiping with their friends, they act like it is a huge inconvenience to do their job and help me find something that has moved. They are frequently out of stock on advertised items and their return policy is terrible compared to Sephora (I rarely return but they always give me a really hard time, even when I've had a reaction to a cosmetic). 

Honestly, the only reason I even come here is when they have 20% off specials on their overly priced items, it makes them reasonable and it's only 2 miles from my home--the only reason I really come here. The Peoria location is much better, but Sephora is better than both for those items that both Ulta and Sephora carry--and they are helpful and give free samples. Sephora, why do you have to be over 10 miles from my home?I have such a love hate relationship with this place.  The food is great as the Surfer Roll is my favorite dish!  The problem is......the service here always seems to suck. I cannot believe that the Owners have not figured this out.  They really need to put their servers through a "How to be a server" course.  Expect them to forget to refill your drink as well as other things that you had asked for.This is a  mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's. 

I went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good! 

I paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, "The same way they burn carrots." Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer. 

Over all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable. She was very good in all of her roles so kudoos to her for make the night bareable.I'm not a big bowler, but when friends want to bowl, I'm down. I've been to this location a few times and I'm not impressed. Where do I start?

HOURS: You'll see hours listed here on Yelp, and some different ones on their website, and some on the door to the business, but when you actually go in and try to bowl the employees tell you earlier times. They informed us that management is trying to save money so they have the employees close early. It was disappointing to think we had 2 hours to bowl according to the website, then actually have less than an hour. 

PRICES: We bowled on a Saturday night for $15/person which included 2 hours of bowling and shoe rental. It went slightly into the fun ultimate bowling or whatever they call it here. The kind w music, fun lights, etc... We had some beer at almost $20 a pitcher, which is kind of expensive. On Tuesday, we weren't really sure what the price was. It kind of seemed like the employees weren't sure how much to charge us for only being able to bowl for 45 minutes because they were closing early. They decided between each other to charge us a total of $10.66 for everything (2 people & shoes). They didn't know how to ring it up though, which led us even further to suspect that this was just a price they made up on the spot.

LOCATION: Unfortunately this alley is located in a questionable part of town. On Sat night there were some creepy looking people loitering in the parking lot. I imagine that if the INSIDE attracted better people, then the outside wouldn't be as creepy.

So...I'll probably try to find a nicer bowling alley nearby if possible and will encourage friends to go elsewhere too.

If your'e the owner or manager, please read on:

I saw several ways that an employer could cut costs to save money without having inconsistent hours. 
-Turn some lights off: if people are only using 4 or 5 lanes, and you're not allowing them to be spread out even if requested (we requested a lane away from other rowdy bowlers but were given a lane RIGHT between them) then turn lights off on the other 90% of the lanes not in use. Or turn off every other one for 1/2 the building. I don't know how the electric is set up, but it might be worth getting it set up to be able to do this.
- Cut staffing down: There were more employees working than lanes being used. That's ridiculous. 4 people working to run credit cards, hand out shoes, and spray them down after they're turned in? That's a 1 person job IF that person knows what to do. Maybe 2 are needed for safety and for the instances where one has to walk down a lane to fetch a ball or something. If the concession guy is closing early, that's a whole additional person who is being paid to stand around, but isn't available to make you money.
-Turn off the video games early: that sucks tons of electricity and if nobody is even remotely interested in using them why have them on? You could leave a sign saying to ask an employee if you want to use the games and they'll turn them on. 
-Turn down the AC: it was freeeeezing in there. I think the temp could be turned up at least 4or 5 degrees which doesn't seem like much, but in a place that size might be a huge monetary savings.
-Prevent theft: I think in order to prevent people suspecting they might be getting ripped off, and to prevent employee theft, you should just have listed prices and signage that gives that info in black and white. It made us uncomfortable to just have the employees throw out a price that seems random like $10.66 for 2 people for 45 minutes.
-Offset the cost of operation by selling drinks and food! When we were there, the concession stand lights were off and they stopped serving everything at least 1/2 hour before the closing time which was an hour and a half before the posted closing time. Nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer. Big mistake management. Big.

I never think that closing early is good for a business. You're the boss though and I guess you can do what you want, but at least have some respect for customers by listing times as "may vary by night and number of customers at employee discretion" so that we have fair warning that we might not get to stay until the advertised times. It sucks to arrive somewhere to find that out.We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time...
We placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training... 
Hubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)...
5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...

Our daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...

OK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (

But the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P
It bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...

I know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am. 
Any of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me.This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time.When I first reviewed this place, I think I was at a loss for good southern BBQ.  Now that I've eaten at Haps a few times, I've noticed a few of the annoying things they do with their food. First, when you come to Haps, you never smell smoking meat, which makes me wonder if they smoke their own BBQ, or they buy it precooked from a distributor.  I've seen them use the microwave to heat their baked beans and their pulled pork, which makes me think they don't cook the BBQ in house.  Their food is certainly better than fast food, but maybe not as good as some other BBQ places in the ValleyLook in the dictionary (remember dictionaries? those books full of definitions of words?) under "consolidated" and you'll find New Times. Once upon a time, in the pre-Yelp/pre-Facebook era, New Times really did serve its purpose as a proverbial 'alternative newsweekly.' It was thicker than a phone book (remember phone books? those books...er, never mind). The point being, half of the pages were full-page ads for car stereo installs and a local movie theater chain - so you could help plan for the weekend. All their staff was local, and Phoenix had New Times, New York had Village Voice, LA had LA Weekly, and so on. 

Oh, how times have changed. New Times circa 2012-2013 really doesn't seem like it's a viable 'alternative newsweekly' anymore. Their editorial bread and butter, as it were, is all Sheriff Joe - and...? Nothing else besides Sheriff Joe? That's really the only local content. I miss "The Bird" column that had more diverse local stories. I miss the pre-foodie 'Cap'n Dave' food sections. And in the Romney 'Women With Binders' era, I really miss their then-controversial coverage of the FLDS compound in Colorado City. It seems like they surrendered it all over to Gannett & AZ Central (the Arizona Republic.) 

Time was, locals would look forward to Thursdays to get a New Times. Now, there really isn't that much gotta-read-it urgency anymore. Pick it up on Friday, on a Saturday, or a Sunday, and it's as "meh" as it gets.I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good, I like their batter, but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  I'm not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any I've had from the Safeway deli.Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved.
Once inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.

I ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland. 

I do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, "that works." 
As a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.

DO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity.This is a wonderful alternative to going on vacation at a fancy resort. The options are limitless and the attractions are many. There truly is something for everyone here. 

They have a kids area with rides from your elementary school carnival. You know the slide that takes off a layer of skin and shocks your ass all the way down? Also, the tilt-a-whirl, no doubt filled with sun-baked vomit. There is a petting zoo, and you can even feed and ride miniature livestock!

You can buy a bird here, and even get a brazillian wax for $45 from a toothless woman. Dining options include pork rinds, funnel cakes, and snow cones.

In all seriousness, it's only $2, the people watching is decent, they have beer, and you might find something cool. I didn't think the prices were spectacular, but maybe I have unrealistic expectations.This review is for Terminal 2  - otherwise known as the 9th level of hell.  

Sky Harbor has several terminals and I have always passed through the main (America West) terminal in my travels to and from Phoenix.  It can get crowded, but hey, it's an airport.  Get used to it.

Terminal 2 however, 'home' to Continental and United Express flights, is the most abysmal place I've seen in a long time.  The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  

I ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my *&$%(#$&  food.  Finally, I get my pastrami and swiss on (grudgingly admitted) good rye bread.

One star for the friendly sky-cap who took my luggage (OUTSIDE the terminal) and one star for the good bread.  Otherwise, if you must travel through this airport, take America West.Aaah, the familiar blast of air conditioning fans my face as we walked out of the gate from the plane... 

Why is it that just one to two days before arriving in Arizona, it was 60 degrees?--the same degree of coolness as the bay, but when we touched Phoenix ground, it's all of a sudden 90 degrees??  And of course, when we leave next week, the temp will plummet back down (at least, according to the news).  The Gods have it in store for my fiance and I to somehow *enjoy* the heat as we visit friends and family twice a year in Mesa.

Anyway, back to the airport..there was this lady parked on the loading zone for 15 minutes waiting for her party.  WTF??  In Oakland, they'll sic the security on you when you so as much touch the curb for 30 seconds without picking or dropping off someone.  I once nearly got into a car accident trying to avoid their palms from hitting my trunk..Pluses: 
-Good central location, as opposed to some airports that are quite far away from the city they serve. 
-Easy to get out of if you are being picked up at the curb (although driving through the airport is a slow process)
-Rental car facility is fairly new and quite spacious, but...

Minuses: 
-Rental car parking facility is far far away. The shuttle bus to go from the rental facility to the terminal is 12-15 minutes, so plan accordingly for your outgoing flight.
-Baggage check and Security lines can be quite long, especially at the SW terminal (C) in the morning. Here's a tip -- if the Gate C security line is very long, try the Gate D entrance. You will have to walk over to C but the reduced wait should make it worth it.Ok, let's try to kill two hours layover on PHX. It is dull and boring. You are hungry and want to find something healthy. I checked three terminals (!) for fresh fruits - nada. Only fast food, and even the chains (like Quiznos, etc) only have a limited selection. There is a bar/ diner with different theme in every terminal. Choice of 5 sandwiches - exactly the same in every single one. Errh. I settled with a fajita-bowl-whatever from a mexican joint, which was the single most disgusting fajita-anything I have ever had. Where is the second star coming from? Looks like they disinfect the bathrooms and they have a free public wireless network, which allows me to write this review live and outraged. You've been yelped!This is just for the service at the US Airways ticket counter. I had to share.
My grandmother, bless her heart, wanted to buy my ticket with her flyer miles. On Friday night we arrived at the ticket counter and they appeared to be closed. Though I believe that we went to the wrong counter. We vowed to come back at six the next morning and by golly I was up at 5:22 a.m.

I'm not a happy morning person so I'm quite asleep. My grandmother is awake and on a mission. We pay $4 for parking and walk up to the ticket counter, no line, no waiting. Things are looking pretty good.

My grandmother says she wants to buy a ticket for me using her flyer miles. The ticket lady looks at us and asks us if we had made a reservation.
"What, we have to make a reservation to come to the airport and buy a ticket?"
My grandmother is irritated with the lady and it hasn't even been 2 minutes. She doesn't let this show, but I can feel it.

I tell her I need a ticket from Phoenix to Dublin and I tell her Sept. 15.
"Booked," she replies.
"Well, try the sixteenth."
"Booked."
"The fourteenth?"
"Booked."
"Try everything from the thirteenth to the twenty-first."
"Booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked, booked."
"Really? This is more than a month in advance? A friend of mine just bought a plane ticket to France three weeks prior to her departure date. Try another airline, maybe Aer Lingus. I found round trip tickets from $768 and one-ways for $459."
"That's a really good deal you should probably go with that if you can get it."
"Well, how much is a one-way ticket for Aer Lingus on the 15th of Sept.?"
"$2,000."

I was afraid that my grandmother was going to have a heart attack. She gasped and stood there with her mouth open. We walked upstairs and sat at a table to call the flight fund people that were supposed to make a reservation for us and magically bestow the flyer miles.
After giving the guy on the phone her life story for computer input on his end he asks, "So where is your grand-daughter going?"
"From Phoenix to Dublin."
"Ma'am I'm sorry this is US only. I'll have to transfer you to our international department."

I sit and stare at the people walking through the airport at this ungodly hour (for me anyway.)
Now she is talking to a woman in the international sector for the miles.
The woman asks what my return date is and my grandmother tells her that the ticket is one-way. I am going for school for a year and have no idea when I will be back.
The woman kindly informs us that unless I am a citizen of the UK I can not get a one-way ticket to Ireland by using flyer miles. But I can get a round trip ticket and then just change the date for a fee of $275! And also to do that my grandmother is 20,000 miles short, she only has 30,000 miles which would have been enough for the one-way ticket.

My grandmother asks how much would it be to just buy the 20,000 miles and the woman on the other end tells her that it would probably cost as much, if not more, than buying a regular ticket.
"Well how much is a regular round trip ticket?"
My grandmother turns white as a ghost. She is breathless as her mouth hangs wide open. I am afraid her heart actually did stop.
She looks at me as she writes the figure on the paper in front of her.
$4,798.

I tell her to hang up. We are going home and I'm going on the internet.
I bought a one-way ticket from Phoenix to Dublin leaving on Sept. 15th for $530.
Funnier yet, I actually got the ticket for the two airlines the ticket lady said was either booked or expensive... US Airways and Aer Lingus.
Thank you Priceline.com.This is just an okay airport - the layout is not great, although I do have to give props to them for easy car rental terminals.Fuck this airport. TPA represent!99% of people traveling the SAN-SJC/SFO route go directly or through LAX. I decided to be a bit adventurous and span my reach out into the desert to explore PHX, to which I have never been before. Sure it cost me 3 extra hours, but it also solidified the notion in my mind that PHX is a piece of shit. During my 2 hour layover, this is what I discovered:

- For some reason, one satellite of Terminal A is close to empty, while the other side is barely navigable. 

- There is absolutely no good food options. All you have to choose from is your typical Burger King-style fast food and other chains that seem like a normal option but turn out to be just as bad and tasteless.

- Everything is just so plain and boring. The walls are a nasty sandy color. The people walking through all have this monotone "don't bother me" look on their face, or maybe that's just what flying does to people these days. The carpets have no life in them, and neither do the employees. It's basically one big shithole.

- Toilets are complete crap. If I move for just a slight second, that doesn't mean you have to flush everything down and spray water everywhere. That's just disgusting.

At least they have free Wi-Fi...1. Who's idea was it to space out the terminals to point that there are only about 8 gates at each corner? which leads to...
2. The food available at each corner is so limited and mundane that unless you have 2 hours to walk around, you're stuck eating at 1 of 3 options available. which leads to...
3. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM!!! and...
4. where are the seats? where are the outlets? where's the mofucking water fountain???

You'll be saying "Where" a lot here.My experience here is not one that has a lot to cover. I was pretty much in and out here so I can't really give a glowing report. Usual fashion the better restaurants are in the main terminal and if you head out to security you end up on one of the satelites and then you have limited selections. I do wish that there were more connections ports for power as many people were wainting in line to power their various mobile devices. I have been in many a better airport than this, nothing overly negative, just nothing to write home about.This airport does not have many amenities, especially in terminal 2.  They have improve what is there but there is mostly just a bunch of wasted space because Alaska Airlines only has 6 or 7 flights per day in and out of here and if you have time to kill, bring a good book or a fully charged laptop so you will have something to occupy yourself with!!Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.

I, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.

The lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century.Home of some of my biggest airport nightmares of all time. Airline check-in is a nightmare (unless you're flying Southwest, they seem to have their stuff together), Security is a nightmare. Home to a disproportionate number of entitled jerky airline passengers. Ugh. I just hate this place. 

Just do yourself a favor, and get there early. You might not need the time every time, but one of these times you will.very large, very confusing, long walk in terminal 4 from gate D to C........long walk and no options.0100 arrival for 150 gal of Jet A and a quick turn. Scruffy, unshaven CSA, dressed in ratty hooded sweatshirt did not project a professional image. When asked, there was no change available for a $20.00 bill for vending machine. Not the level of service expected from a high end FBO. We'll make another facility choice next time.Writing this review breaks my heart.

Multiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s (with cattle all around back then); all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates, the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home, and so many good times.

When Tom and his crew took it over back in the 90s, he essentially left its classics alone. For lunch you could have a burger or orgasmic BBQ beef sandwich to die for; for dinner you could surf and turf and enjoy yourself more than you could at the high rent district places. Oh, the biscuits and  what we called "crack honey butter" - one died and went to heaven, it was so good.

Then it closed for renovations - much needed and overdue; the electrical was shaky back then, part of its charm - and everyone I know looked forward to its reopening.

They killed it. The look was the same, but the food.. oh no. My dad was in mourning for months. I tried it again several months later - same thing. Tried it with husband some months after that.. same thing. I was even there in February (2011) after over a year of absence, and if anything, the menu got more trendy and more cutesy and more expensive. So much for my birthday treat to myself. So you see, I want to come back, but they killed the perfection of simpler, tasty, perfectly prepared meals in favor of the rare, the trendy, and the expensive.

Prickly pear butter? Jalapenos in the cornbread? While the steaks are fine, all the cutesy crap on the menu seems to me as if they're trying to attract tourists a la Scottsdale... what a travesty. It's not just an long-time patron and family lamenting the old days; it's the truth. 

It can't be explained by being screwed by the light rail line or "changing tastes." It's called they want to attract the business, moneyed and trendy crowds and that's the reason why you'd better bring your platinum card here.

If an edgy, expensive steakhouse is what you're looking for, this is it. If not, go to Morton's for the money.I usually take my brother in law here for his birthday. Last year it was fabulous. This year, not so much. We got to the bar (Happy Hour) about 4:15, ordered our refreshments and saw the sliders, the oh so cold sliders. Remembering last years visit we were disappointed. We finished our drinks and sauntered into the dining room. We both ordered the prime rib and after we were served I cut a piece of my cold to the touch $34 prime rib. My brother in laws meat was so tough the steak knife had to be used like a saw. We told the waitress about the cold meat and in as professional a manner as I've ever seen she removed it and apologized. Forward 5 minutes she returns with my second prime rib. I touched the top and it was minimally warmer, although the plate was so hot it couldn't be touched. Cut into this one and again barely warm. I now asked for the chef knowing some line cook had plated my food. Who appears? The owner. I explained my concerns and on the third try received a warmer, still not hot piece of meat. By now the serving and returning had spanned about 20 minutes, I had already finished most of my baked potato and just wanted to leave. So after ordering two end cuts we ended up with inside cuts and more frustration than needed. They knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink. Simply stated, I'll never return. If the meal was free I wouldn't go back just based on the frustration aspect. The front room and owner were extremely professional, but I'm thinking they're cutting corners with the kitchen staff and that's unacceptable.Congratulations Alaska Airlines. After not allowing me to check in online you denied me a ticket because I was one minute past the cutoff. I fly all over the world and this happens occasionally but I have never been denied. So I will sleep in the airport tonight when a bit of caring by your personnel could have avoided this. I have flown with you whenever possible but never again.
My fault for not knowing the shuttle uses were dedicated to specific terminalsThey were good when they were gas carts. Now it is slow, the staff is rude and the management is ruder! Save your money and go bowling or something. You'll end up with more adrenaline than racing around in electric karts!2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.  

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.  

So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over

Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.  

So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.  

So what are the odds I'll get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience.Well, it's been a little over a year since visiting this nearest to my house Buffet, so I dropped in here today joined by Mike C. to see how they're doing.

THE GOOD:

*  Friendly host.     :-)

*  Low price of $6.88/6.30 Sr. including beverage.     :-)

*  Moderate selection of 64 food items, plus sauces & dressings.

*  Good drink selection including coffee & horchata.     :-)

*  Good food overall, including treats such as Albondigas Soup, Jalapeño Chicken, pork spare ribs, & rich, tasty soft ice cream.     :-)

Then why only 2 Stars, you ask?¿?

WELL...

*  There's a snarky smell to this place.  It was here last year too, although I didn't include it in my review.  Has the carpeting EVER been cleaned in this place?  It doesn't look like it!     :-O

*  The Men's bathroom is a disaster case with graffiti all over the place.     :-O

*  FOUR TVs now blab away, all in Spanish, & all on different station!     :-O

Whatever.Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.

I went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.

I don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup.I have gone to this Firestone location twice for oil changes in my Mustang.  The first time, I got no sticker indicating the month / mileage I needed to get another oil change at.  I didn't notice until I got home.  It's full synthetic so not that big a deal -- annoying but I just marked the calendar in my blackberry to remind me a few months down the road.  

The second time, the tech had oil on his boot and when he put his feet on the drivers side floormat to bring the vehicle back around after the oil change, he got oil all over it.  I was on the phone when I got back in the vehicle and, again, didn't notice.  My loss, because it's permanently stained. I had the floormats professionally shampooed afterwards but it didn't help.    Fortunately, it was just the floormat, not the actual carpet.

Two careless and annoying mistakes in two visits = two stars and no third chance.So I called a random Pizza Hut, found out they won't deliver to my house.  They give me the number of the closest Pizza Hut.  I call them.  They don't deliver to my house either, but I can come pick it up.  So, I order my pizzas for all the folks there watching the game that night (Night is actually an important detail here) and about 10 minutes later I drive on over.  I can't help wondering why this location just 8 minutes away from my house doesn't deliver.  

Now I know.

The Pizza Hut doesn't have a door. It has a window.  Yes, a window.  More in the "Protective" than the "Decorative" sense of a window.  There are 3 groups already there ahead of me.  Two look quite respectable, one... well-l-l........quite a bit less so.  One group picks up their pizza.  Down to 3 of us.  The other group is a small family and they are ordering right at the window and are going to wait for it to be ready.  Scary guy, who's been kinda twitching and not making eye contact, says I can go ahead of him.  Thank goodness!  I grab my pizzas and I'm out of there.  

While the pizza was fine there (not impressive but didn't make me sick), I am never, ever, ever picking up pizza here alone at night.  

Ever.This is definitely a Meh rating.  If I did not work near, then I would never imagine going, as it does look a little sketchy from the outside. 

The food itself is just ok at best to me.  Don't expect any salads to knock your socks off as this is not their speciality.  They have decent thick cut fries, but not the best.  They can sometimes be overly soggy.  Most of the folks that like a greasy gyro would dig this place, but I think it lacks full flavor and other options outside of gyros - which I do realize is hard to do when you have the word Gyros in your name.

If you have more time, there are other places within 5 minutes that for the same cost are worth going to and passing over this place.Place is alright. I was in a hurry and needed gas, but if you get Chevron, you're better off going to the one on Kyrene or Rural on Baseline. A lot cheaper compared to this one.I really wanted to love this place.  It's so close, it's Fish & Chips and BBQ and other great hole in the wall fare.  Unfortunately, it has never really risen above.  If I really didn't want to cook and it was the only restaurant open in the area, sure I might give in to it.  Beyond that, it's going to be quite a while before I give them a chance again.  

The fish was fine, but the atmosphere well... it wanted to grow up and be a seedy dive bar.  Those were it's aspirations, but it wasn't quite there.  There is some seating, but not much.  If you're in the area and really want to try it, it's certainly an experience, but it's not one I want again any time soon.I love the atmosphere here but the food has taken a turn for the worst.  This used to be my favorite breakfast place but something has changed.  The food looks like the chef does not care.  There was no garnish on the plate, my eggs were cold.  My friend's waffles were burnt.  This is a lovely place to visit with a friendly wait staff but I do not recommend the food.I have wanted to go here for brunch for a long time.  Finally made it there this past weekend.  Great setting -- so pretty and unique and reminds that Phoenix can be awesome.

I arrived at 11:30 and had a 20 minute wait. No big as it gave me time to walk the grounds.  Was seated, odered the ham & cheese omelletee with home fries.  Food took about 30 minutes, again no biggie but something to be aware of if you are hungry and/or with children.

Food was dropped off with not much fan fare.  Immedietly I saw a black hair sticking out of the fries.  Eww and Hello!  Did no one see this?  Ate the omelette, was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries.  It was gross.  One hair falls out --ok its unfortunate, but this...was like someone had pulled these long hairs out in wrapped them up in the fries.

No thanks.Mct oil buy 2 get the second half off. Good deal. The employees were pestering me to buy stuff even after I told them I knew what I was looking for.The wings were just fine, but the restaurant seemed dirty.  The floor was sticky, the tables had not been cleaned, and the whole place smelled like stale beer.  I wasn't looking for fine dining, but I was looking for a place that looks like it passed it's health inspection.  I don't think I will be returning on my next trip.I'm only willing to give this a 2 because I think the restaurant has potential.  I've now gone twice because my friend stands by it being the best in the area.  Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.

The second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.  

After the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.  I highly advise that the owner or GM takes a good look at his staff and the way things are being ran.  It's a bad restaurant in every way.I don't understand the good reviews for this place.
I gave this place two tries.  Went with my boyfriend for lunch and it was okay for the price, not great.. but decent.
We thought dinner would be better, a lot of sushi places don't exactly shine for lunch.  We judge a place based on the nigiri.  It just wasn't that... great... it wasn't that fresh, wasn't that flavorful.. just not up to par at all.  We took people there for a business meeting and the people that are just used to tempura and California rolls seemed happy.  
Basically.. cheap rolls and tempura.. okay for lunch.
If you are a sushi snob, find somewhere that showcases the fish more. 
Oh! And this place plays 90's pop music loudly.  Weird.About the same as the other locations for Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, but this one is more convenient to a major highway (I-10).  I wish they would stop making so many menu changes, which are often for the worse.  Food has gone downhill in the last couple years, and beers are rather uninspiring.  For convenience sake I might stop here with low expectations, but if you have the time I'd advise that you seek another dining choice.I am surprised by the good reviews.  I went as a last minute lunch and got a veggie bagel sandwich with fruit and a pickle spear.  It was about $5.50 with tax and I left still hungry.  The bagel was just okay.  The fruit was very fresh and that was a plus.

I have had much better bagel sandwiches.  I miss Brueggers in Chandler.I have tried this place a few times, but I have to agree the  barristers always seem to be in a bad mood and put out when you order.  They never say hello or seem to even want you in the place.  There are always a couple people in there so maybe they just like their regulars.  I always get the same thing at every coffee place, a mocha, and the ones here don't ever taste like espresso or chocolate they always taste like milk.  If you are in the shopping center I guess it's passable, but I wouldn't go out of my may since there is a coffee place in every shopping center here.Great place for a date or small group but the food and service is a bit overrated! Its also pricey for what you get. I think I paid about $120 for a table of 3 the last time there.We ate here this Saturday night, August 31 using a DealChicken voucher that we had purchased for $99.

The voucher was for a 4-course menu of endless fondue, including a cheese fondue to start, 4 sales, an endless fondue entree, chocolate fondue for dessert, plus a bottle of wine. This was supposedly a $200 retail value. In addition, a 20% gratuity, placed on the full value of the meal, before tax, was to be added.

While the service was fine, and I really don't have too many complaints regarding the food, this was the first time I've ever been mislead by a restaurant when purchasing a voucher. The actual retail value, according to their menu, was $168.80, not $200. This included 4 endless fondue entrees at $36.95 each, plus a $21 bottle of wine.

While I understand that restaurants take a fraction of their regular margins when accepting a voucher from DealChicken, Groupon, Living Social, etc., it's a marketing decision they have decided to make to hopefully attract new customers. I was very disappointed to find out that this Melton Pot location had inflated their base prices before selling the voucher, and included a mandatory gratuity based on that same inflated value.

While I have no issue tipping 20% for great service, I prefer to tip on the actual value of the meal... not an overstated number.

While the food was okay, I can't in good heart return to a restaurant that nickels and dimes its customers. This was very disappointing and I expected better from a national chain.Prior to arriving to the Melting Pot we made reservations for 4 (the next table was available at 9pm) and had looked at some of their specials. We knew they had a three course option for $30 since it was AZ Restaurant Week and they also had a company special which was endless fondue (which was really just endless entree) for around $37. Half of us were carnivores and opted for this choice, which caused real confusion for our waiter, so we all agreed to just pay the $7 more (not a big deal since we were getting endless shrimp and filet). The cheese course was fine but the salads were small and mediocre. When the salads arrived we had asked for salt, which our waiter never brought. One person in our party had been waiting to enjoy their salad with some salt so it wasn't until another employee dropped our entree broth 10 minutes later that we got the salt. After a lengthy wait,(I believe there was now only one other table in the place), our server came to ask if we would like to order drink refills first before he brought our long anticipated entree....Finally, we received our entree, perhaps adequate for two people, but certainly not four. The waiter did make a good recommendation on the mojo cooking style (but had implied that it was included in the price of the special). After sitting with no food for another 20+ minutes, we were given the dessert menu, I asked about refills on the beef and shrimp. He later returned with 5 shrimp and about 6 bite size portions of beef. Five minutes later, we began our wait again for our next "endless entree" refill. The waiter returned to our table and asked if we would like to take our dessert to go?!! Really?!! Sure, let me just swing past Williams-Sonoma & pick up a fondue set! He seemed a bit shocked when we said no and advised him we had been waiting for more shrimp. We wanted one more refill when he came to the table with another employee following behind us holding our dessert (who then proceeded to turn around in a very disgruntled manner). I would have been more understanding if they had been busy or we had not seen the waitstaff standing idly while we were waiting for food and drink refills. It took 3 hours and $240 to have what you you would normally enjoy in appetizers or at a tapas bar. Again, no complaints on the food quality, but the slow service and lack of refills on both food and drinks made it seem like the most expensive meal, gram for gram, that I have ever eaten. I would have much rather spent it at a nice steak or seafood establishment. The decor is also quite dated and not nearly as "romantic" as I had envisioned. Probably an OK place to take a first date and share an appetizer fondue before going somewhere for a real dinner.It's a bar.

The beer selection is great as is the happy hour menu.  We had one of everything as it was a long day at work. 

It would have been awesome if the bartender would have given a crap about us or the job that she was doing. 

I won't say that I'd never go back, it just isn't on my list of places that I will run to in Ahwatukee.The only reason it got a two stars is because the waitress was great!! The food was not good at all maybe it was a bad night who knows. Little disappointed as this place is right around the corner from my house and it looks like I will need to find a different place to grab a bite to eat. I'm not going to beat this place up with a long drawn out review all I am going to say is sadly I don't plan in coming back.the thing that stunned me was the hostess. She was not at all happy, and when she seated us, i saw a delicious soup someone next to us was having and i asked her "omg what is that soup it looks good???" and she looked at me like i was dumb and said, "....i dont know" and walked away...it was ridiculous....my gf that i was with is a hostess and she was in disbelief too....she could have said, "I'm not sure, ill ask your waitress to find out, or i will find out for you" but "...i dont know" with an attitude? very dissapointing especially being the FIRST impression that we have when we walk in.... very bad customer perception. 



Besides that, The food was awesome, and my waitress was awesome...but very dissapointing on the hostess end...first impressions are everything.If it wasn't for the waitress I would give the experience a one.  The food was not hot- even after sending it back the 2nd time.  I ordered onion soup- and the first time it was luke warm...the 2nd time...not even that...then the french dip was delivered with cold aus juice.  The waitress was exceptional.  She was actually a new waitress and very very good.  If this establishment doesn't get their back end up to par, this waitress will find herself at another establishment, probable the competition and I have no doubts doing very well for herself.  She was on top of everything. Even when the "manager" took off the wrong meal she caught it.  She was there for the refills on drinks and if it wasn't for her, we would have walked away.  

I've been to Mimi's many times and the last 4 or 5 at this location the food has been a "C".  The service usually an "A" or "B".  Management needs to come across a little more sincere too with their apologies.Not really a spot I'd chose, but in this strip of chain restaurants we were short on time and long on hunger. I'd give this 2 star in terms of food. 

On the brighter side, service was great and parking is plentiful.The service, chips and salsa were fine then it all went South.  I had the La Bandera (3 enchiladas) and all of them were tasteless and the meat was tough.  I went because I had a gift card.  As much as I love free meals I would gladly have paid double for good food.I ordered three mini cakes--carrot cake, lemon cake, and chocolate chip cake.  I tried the carrot cake and the lemon cake.  The carrot cake was dry and flavorless.  Or maybe the abundance of frosting overwhelmed what little flavor the cake had.   The lemon cake was slightly better in terms of flavor, but it was still dry.  My husband said that the chocolate chip cake was underwhelming.  There is too much frosting and not enough cake.  With a mini cake costing $4, I was expecting much better.  Much much betterTaken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place.Nothing special. Truly a dive. Almost a dump. But nice people and ok food. Drove 27 miles to check it out because of the TV show. Wasn't worth it.This place was featured on Diners and Dives, so we had high expectations.  We had 4 types of tacos and a shrimp burrito.  The carne asada tacos were the best ones, but the meat was a bit dry.  The lengua was alright but the pieces were too big.  The shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it.   We live in Scottsdale, and I don't think we'll make the trip to eat there again.My lady and I finally got around to eating here and did it disappoint.  I ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich, she an Artichoke Chicken Pita Sandwich.

First, the meat in my Italian Beef was bland, really bland.  I was sprinkling salt on my sandwich.  I can't remember any time I ever sprinkled salt on anything, after it was prepared.

I opted for hot peppers over the sweet (Actually, I asked for hot & sweet but he said it'd cost more for both.  Yeesh.).  I didn't see or taste any.

I asked for the sandwich to be dipped but I was expecting, y'know, an actual roll.  The 'bread' must've been like those premium hot dog buns that Costco sells because it just mushed up, completely.  That's probably what bummed me out the most because when your teeth just break the barely crusty exterior of that roll and the au jus bursts from the inside, that's what you get Italian Beefs for.  Just mush at Niro's.

I just asked my lady what she thought of her sandwich, "It was plain and didn't fill me up."  Now, my girlfriend isn't the hearty eater that I am.  She's pretty slim and rarely finishes anything.  She's also allergic to onions so is used to having food that has no flavor (Heehee).  For her to say those things, it's bad.

We shared a side of fries and they were good, though. Not great.

We won't be visiting Niro's again.  I recommend Chizona's Pizza for a good Italian Beef, if you're in the Scottsdale area.I was walking around aimlessly for 15 minutes, hoping I could get some assistance. That was wishful thinking. The staff seems to be in their own world. The Geek Squad people are even worse. There is a line of people waiting and the only employee not doing something is texting at her register. Girl I get it.. Work is boring but can you please help me right quick?

Note to Management: Arrange some customer training for your employees. I'm thinking they need a refresher course on how to deal with us. This is not a lost cause. There is definitely room for improvement.Pretty lame subs and sandwiches. Worked close by so tried a few times. Hate to say it, but Subway is much better. Quality and quantity of ingredients in the so so bread left a lot to be desired.

Service was okay but nothing to Yelp positively about.Just dined there this evening, and we were fairly disappointed. The food was very nicely prepared, tasted just fine, however the service left a lot to be desired. And the worst thing was that both our dinners, and my coffee ended up at our table lukewarm. if you can't manage to bring items to the table hot, than the rest of this review begins to hardly matter. The waitress was snippy, not friendly in any discernible way. The water and coffee were very slow to be refilled, in fact everything was slow about the service. They brought out our entrees while our appetizer plates were still on the table...and they had been sitting there for some time! One of them never did get picked up. From here, I hardly feel the need to mention the screaming baby, the pretty Italian music that got cut off halfway through our meal, and the confusion/staff bickering that we encountered when we first arrived... but there you go. They told me they have been in business for 20 years, but they still can't seem to get the most basic components right. Overpriced, and not a good experience. Try someplace else.The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me? It was like a "fun size" but I was looking for the king size cheesecake. Other than that I don't think I'll be back.Pretty good happy hour. Not very authentic sushi. I hate people who think the can say they "LOVE RA" but the only thing they get are the California rolls. If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi- stay away. Fun atmosphere, pretty good service, cheap happy hour, but I've def had better sushi.I'm not usually the biggest fan of Ra to begin with but we go there every now and then for Happy hour for sushi.  We decided to go to the Awhatukee location this time instead of Tempe.  Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses. 

We were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered 3 rolls.  It took them 45 minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him 10 minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I don't think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant.I visit this spot for the Happy Hour.   3-7pm.  

The Viva Las Vegas Roll is pretty delicious & fancy if made right.  Sometimes, I've had it look like a disaster during Happy Hour.  Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.

The music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.

Even during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.

All in all, mehh... if you're really hard up for somewhere to go, it's an experience.I keep hearing good things about Neo Tokyo and have driven by it way to many times. I went for lunch the restaurant was empty well waiting for my food I saw everyone was getting take out. The staff was really friendly the restaurant really clean... I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well. I will not be going back for lunch anytime soon.The gym has machines constantly out of service and sometimes doesn't even bother putting the "out of service" sign on the machine because they probably ran out. They don't clean thoroughly enough, usually just picking up trash, cleaning floor, and bathrooms. The machines themselves have filth caked up in the cup holders. Pads always have holes and tears in them. I switched to planet fitness because it was nicer and the same price. 

When I canceled they charged me a $25 dollar fee which they say they only do if you cancel before 6 months. I have exactly 6 months worth of charges from them. I doubt this was just an accident. Glad I pay with my AMEX which doesn't need any paperwork to do a charge-back under $50.Arrived and an hour wait just to check-in.  Lobby is hot, uncomfortable temp wise.  Very poor customer service so far, especially for the price.This review is for the spa services. The facial was extremely disappointing - the room was not clean, the bed was squeaky and the therapist had very poor technique.  The facial was at a level you get at a cheep salon, not what you should expected from a five start spa.  The rest area at the spa was not up to par - the beds were uncomfortable, overall service and the atmosphere was not what you expect for the price.  And on top of that, my lunch was 40 min late.  One bright spot of the day was the body treatment.only gave 2nd star because I was here with wife on a biz trip - and it seems that they have function facilities, that are at least functional...

Staff has been rude or non-existent at every turn. The place is gigantic - and it ALL LOOKS THE SAME (blah 1970's tan stucco) - so I spend half my time outside lost and asking for directions (see rude staff).

I came here to work out of the hotel room and get a little sun at the tail end of a hard New England winter - and the sun has cooperated - but little else has...

If I were spending my own money, I would be super pissed.

My recommendation is to avoid this place like the plague - have stayed at Hyatt Gainey Ranch and Phoenician for similar $$$ - and never thought once about writing a bad review...

I'd be surprised if this place was stil in business 5 years from now...Over 150 reviews for you to read about this mediocre steakhouse.  I ordered the St. Louis pork ribs which were very tender but slathered in a cloyingly sweet bbq sauce. The corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob, been in hot water a long long time!  Their cowboy beans were average at best,  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken, fairly good and lots of it (3 breasts with the bone deep fried) but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy, enough to sparely cover one breast.  The salad needed more dressing but was refreshing.  Best part of the meal was the Indian fry bread. The green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned.  The place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background.  I left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $40+ meal.I can't be a huge fan of this place knowing there is so many other steakhouses out there that will serve a $20+ steak or filet cooked to absolute perfection. The sides are average at best. Green beans overdone, rice is tasteless, the only thing worth mentioning was the salad was actually decent! 
BUT...Only have ranch dressing or oil and vinegar. Really?! 
Finally, the view is spectacular, but doesn't make up for overpriced food with no personality.

Service was mediocre at best.This place is super cute. The slide is a blast for kids! The food is alright. Just alright. The service is not good at all. We came for my best friend's birthday and upon arrival we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. We asked if we could sit in the bar area to order a drink and we were told we could order drinks and appetizers while we waited. So we ordered some snacks and drinks. We were hungry! About three minutes later they said our table was ready! We wouldn't have ordered all the snacks if we'd known the wait would only be three minutes! We asked the server what happened and she was rude and dismissive. Totally not apologetic. The service in general was unappreciative and smug. Definitely didn't feel appreciated at all. We ordered dessert to go and they didn't give us napkins or utensils. Bummer.Our last visit 06/26/2014 was disappointing. The steak, a rib-eye, was excellent and very tasty, however it ends here. The vegetables, broccolli and carrots, were smothered in peppercorn to the point they were inedible. The fact that no other vegetables were available is mind boggling. The cowboy beans were doused in ketchup. This is unfortunate because in September, 2013, our previous visit, the food was much better. This time we ended up only eating the steaks. Shame!Ranks poorly against some of the great Thai restaurants I have visited. The food lacked flavor and color ( Anemic ), The vegetables were of poor quality and a BBQ Chicken we ordered was yellow ? pounded too thin and of questionable quality. Would have enjoyed a non fried appetizer ? some refreshing spring rolls would have been appreciated. We did order some tasty fried calamari, probably the highlight of this forgettable meal. Nothing about this place, including service gave me the impression we would return.Worse thai food i had in a while. Tasted very watery. No flavor at all had a curry. Was pretty much coconut water with very little veggies and almost no taste.First time we went I was very impressed...owner is such a nice man. Food was really good.  Our seconds experience we ordered for takeout and not as good. Latest time we had a groupon. We were there for at least 2 hours. It was very warm, none of the tables were clean, service was terrible, there was a little girl running back and forth screaming and worst of all was the food. They have gotten very skimpy. I think our food was sitting for a while before it was served because all of it was cold. Too bad because it was so good the first time.I gave them two stars instead of one because I have had past good experiences. THEY USUALLY ARE NO EXPENSIVE, HOWEVER THE SERVICE IS USUALLY RUDE AND UPSOLD. I came in to get my oil change I have taken vehicles there many times and Ikm not stupid I know what oil goes in my car. The tech at the desk was new, I have never seen him before, and how he was talking to me made me feel like he thought I was stupid. I'm a girl who is a grease monkey, but in 110 degrees I'm not doing an oil chnge its too darn hot. He kept trying to upsell me on packages I did not need. He even went as far to tell me that 5W30 is not a conventional oil that it is only available in a synthetic blend or full synthetic. Now come on, seriously. I told him I felt he was trying to take advantage of me and walked out. I went to advanced auto on warner and 48th street. I have gone here before and they are amazing, Why in the world did I not go there first. So if you don't want to wait forever, not have rude upsell service and not have the tech talk down to you, go to advanced auto. These guys are great, no wonder they consistently win the BBB ethics torch award .I usually have excellent service at this location, so maybe this was an off day.  I dropped my car off and asked how long for a tire rotation.  They said 45-60mins max.  After 60 mins of waiting, my car still hadn't been moved or worked on.  I couldn't wait any longer, especially since service hadn't begun yet, so I asked for my keys.  The manager was very apologetic and sincere and asked me to wait a little longer, but I had an appointment to get to...so off I went  Service could have been better if they kept me informed of the delay, I'm pretty understandable, but there was no communication.  I will still try them again.After reading all of the stellar reviews, I was expecting stellar.

The Good:
I like that they have the Sushi Bar.
The expansive dining area was aesthetically pleasing

The Bad:
I just didn't like any of their other items... 

I tend toward less "Americanized" Asian food, and they didn't have a wide assortment, for my liking.Wanted to try because of all the great reviews but sadly a little disappointed. Service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre.Service was great, but the food was definitely lackluster. However, the apple strudel dessert was fantastic. Next time
we will just go for the dessert!We came here for breakfast. For years Ive been hearing how great this place is...WTH?  What a disappointment!  Food was luke warm to cold, bland and just yucky. Maybe lunch would be better? Im afraid to try...I have no Clue why people this this place was good. It was bearable at best.  The food was not awful, but not anything to jump up and brag about either.. The Store is interesting and I suggest you look through and browse.Was there a shortage of BBQ sauce today?  Thanks for the non-barbecue chopped salad CPK!!!While the food taste the same here as any other PB, the portion sizes are ridiculously small for what you pay.  I ordered the scrambled egg breakfast for $6.99, it was less than 1 egg with a tiny, tiny cup of fruit, a small piece of toast and was missing the bacon!  It cost them less than a dollar for sure!!!  The yogurt parfait was $4, and was one very small scoop of yogurt a few pieces of granola and 3 berries!  The service is VERY slow, the Manager on duty did NOT look or act like he wanted to be there and SHAME on him for making fun of one of the workers behind her back in customer ear shot!  Disrespectful!!So now they've nixed the potstickers, the asiago dip, the portabella sandwich, and the fried mozz appetizers.  They also changed their fries away from the thinner variety to a more traditional & common medium thickness.  They just can't get it right, can they?

Beers are the only reason to come back.  Who knows what they'll do with the menu next?!I'm staying near the Desert Ridge area for about a month and have been here twice. However, after the last experience, I think it will be a while since I come here again or recommend this place to friends.

The first time I came here was around lunch time since we were at Desert Ridge and looking for a bite to eat.  We ordered a combo of appetizers and entrees.

Mac & Cheese Bites with Truffle Dip - it is okay, just little balls of mac and cheese that is later fried. When you bite into it, it is airy and there isn't a whole lot of taste to it.

Zucchini Fritti with Truffle Dip - I wouldn't recommend this appetizer again unless they keep an eye on how long they fry the zucchini.  The idea sounds good, long strips of zucchini that is fried almost like thin strips of chips, however, what came out was less than desired.  Most of what was on our plate was over fried. I don't mean "golden brown" either, but like dark brown, inedible pieces.  We didn't complain to the waiter but he must've seen that most of the plate was untouched.

Penne Rustica - roasted chicken, shrimp, rosemary cream, prosciutto, parmesan. This was alright, I thought the pasta was a bit overcooked and not al dente, but it wasn't mushy either.

Sweet Corn & Clam Fettuccine- clams, pancetta, celery, cream, white wine, green onion.  My friend ordered this and substituted with penne pasta instead. She seemed to like it although found it to be a bit too heavy as she got to the end of the dish.

Service was fine on our first visit.

Then about two weeks later I took my aunt/uncle who were visiting from out of town. We decided to stop here for a late lunch. It was around 1:45 pm by now.
When we entered, most of the dining area was empty with the exception of two small tables that had people who were eating. The annoying part of this was that we waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came by to actually seat us, we basically gone unnoticed and there was 3 of us with 2 more on their way. I had to approach someone to mention we would like to be seated. If we didn't already arrange to meet my aunt and uncle to meet us there already, I would've left the restaurant and gone elsewhere. 
 
We ordered a few appetizers to share, and I mentioned to our table not to order the zucchini fritti after last time's bad experience.

Calamari Fritti - fried calamari was actually pretty good. The batter was light and there was a fair amount of calmari to share.
 
Lobster-Stuffed Clams- clams, pancetta, garlic breadcrumbs, red pepper aioli. This was a disappointing item. It sounded good from the description, but the clams were tiny, couldn't find much (if any lobster) and you tasted more breadcrumbs than anything else.

Shrimp Portofino - jumbo shrimp, capellini, spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts, lemon butter. This this was fine, perhaps a bit too much oil for my taste.
 
The rest of the group ordered the combo lunch specials and then another ordered the sweet corn & clam fettuccine. 

The service this time wasn't very good. Yes, she came to get our drinks when we first sat down, but we had to flag her down to take our orders and also to get us some more bread and refill our drinks midway.  Mind you, this place had a total of 3 tables including us and there were a few waitstaff working that day.  Paying for the bill took forever as well.

Overall, the food isn't terrible here but there are some dishes better than others. Service I wish would be more consistent.My husband, daughter, mother, and I decided to revisit Macaroni Grille after an absence of two or three years, because of several mediocre to bad experiences. We were excited to go back, confident they would have improved and we would have a good meal. We arrived later than usual (7:30 pm) on a weeknight, but they were still open and had a smattering of diners. Our waitress, Lynette was personable and prompt at first, bringing us small water glasses and a carafe with the menus, then following it with a loaf of bread and oil with ground pepper. (I always thought it was a mixture of fresh ground herbs that the server added to the oil--nope! Just pepper.) I was disappointed in the bread--cold and dry. We asked for another loaf, hoping for a fresh one, but more of the same bland disappointment. It was "too late" for good bread, I guess. She gave us very little oil, but left the bottle on the table, and was very light on the pepper. I asked for more and she ground two more twists. I just added pepper from the shaker. Salads were delivered just minutes after we gave our order and they were delicious (all Caesar). Our main dishes were prompt to our table, as well. The breaded sole was beautifully presented and a generous portion, though a little heavy on the butter, still delicious. The rice pilaf was unremarkable, but complemented the sole nicely. The rest of our party ordered Pasta Milano, one added pine nuts. It was difficult to discern which dish had the added pine nuts, since the addition was so small. When the dishes were delivered, no fresh grated Parmesan was offered. We requested it from Lynette and after a false start of an empty grater, we were able to top off our dishes with the cheese. The Pasta Milano was unremarkable. The mushrooms were not sautéed well...they were stiff and almost crunchy, as if they were just coated in the olive oil/butter mixture in the pan and added to the dish. I didn't feel like the sauce had matured, either. One in our party ordered coffee and our server never checked to see if she needed more. We had to remind her for a refill and both cups were strong and bitter. We placed a to go order that was delivered promptly, but without any bread. I had to ask for a loaf and she brought two. We had asked for separate checks when we ordered and she said to remind her if she forgot at the end of the meal. (I thought that was odd.) When the bill came, she had indeed forgotten the separate bill request. It took five minutes to get her attention and change the bill. I was disappointed in our evening out. The company and conversation was wonderful, but the food and some of the service was well below par. We will be frequenting other establishments from now on.I usually have my Friday Night Fish at the Peoria Café but wanted to try another restaurant just for a change but am sorry I did. 
The place was about  1/2 full of guests and I was one of three sitting at the counter only to have to wait 20 minutes for a server. Seemed like all of the servers were having a rough night as I failed to see anyone in the whole place smile, which includes the customers. My food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering and it looked great but one bite of the Cod told me I made a bad choice in changing restaurants. The breading they used tasted like uncooked flour and real chalky, I can't seem to get that taste out of my mouth. The fish itself was nice but the coating was horrible. I hope it was just a bad night but the server expressed regrets for being stuck on the Friday night schedule and her enthusiasm seemed the same as all the ladies working. Come to think of it I have my own regrets for being there, Next week I will be back to the Peoria Café!Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying. 
I took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless.
I'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy.Roy's is suppose to be good. And being my first experience here, it was just TERRIBLE. It was a fusion of untasteful flavors that was just disappointing. 

Starting with the drinks, the fruit drinks tasted very off in flavor...chemical flavors, man! Our entire party thought the food was mediocre and quite below par. I ordered the Szechuan Peppercorn Salmon dish with garlic rice and bak choy. My expectations was a very spicy and tasty dish. But instead, the berry toppings were overcooked and the salmon tasted like something I could make at home. 

The appetizer platter we tried had a sweet and sour sauce, but it tasted more sour than anything. Eww! Maybe that evening's head chef didn't feel like cooking, but man the food was just bad. 

Would this deter me from another visit to Roy's? No. But if I experience it again, Roy's will be off my list.A few coworkers & I were in Phoenix over Valentine's Day, and we paid a visit to Roys that night. 

I will preface this review by letting you know that my individual bill at Roys was over 90$ and I didn't even order a cocktail. 

The restaurant is fancy, upscale, expensive, romantic, etc. The type of place people might visit on a *special occasion.*

I fully understand the type of offerings this restaurant has and nowhere in print has this restaurant claimed to be veg-friendly, however I was extremely disappointed at the response I got when I requested a vegetarian meal. I was offered pasta & artichoke. 

(This may not sound cliche if you are not a vegetarian, however if you are you know that hotels and restaurants OFTEN offer pasta due to a lack of knowledge and/or creativity) 

Do you meat eaters and chefs think that's all we eat? Bunny food?

While my co-workers thought that food was decent, delicious, I was borderline miserable. 

With a claim like this....

"Chef Roy has created many signature dishes that have become international favorites through the years. Many of these are featured on our menus throughout the country in addition to the uniquely designed offerings created by our local Chef partners, each of whom has been trained under the tutelage of Roy Yamaguchi himself."

.....you'd think this guy could come up with something more than just pasta for someone who doesn't want to eat seafood.....melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor, if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right,  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger, all were cooked correctly and tasted good, the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward, the bok choy side consisted of one leaf, must be running low.  Dessert was ok they did a great job making scratch creme brulee taste like instant and the pineapple thingy was the high light of the evening, if I was headed home from a winning time at the casino and my car broke down out front I would think about stopping in for a biteI used to love this place a couple of years ago, what happened??? I always got their Bankok Pad Thai Noodles with veggies and added chicken and it was great! Today my boss offerred to buy lunch for everyone and we decided on EB because it's right across the street. 
Sadly every single order was either poorly made, over cooked or in my case- completely wrong! 

I was looking forward to hot, sticky, carb-y, noodle-y goodness and wound up with some hard, fire-blasted chicken turds on top of a green salad with tomatoes, cucumbers and wonton strips. Someone from EB wrote "thai" on it and that's how I figured out it was mine (since there were no noodles). Very VERY disappointing. Hopefully it was just a really really crappy day for them and an equally crappy lunch for me and my co-workers.One word sums this place up - overrated! It was a Sunday and I tried locating a Thai or Pho establishment and everything nearby was closed except for Tea Lite Cafe.

Located in a large big box shopping center Tea Lite Cafe is small and was fulled to capacity. When I inquired to the Asian if they had a sign in waiting list he replied no so we had to wait and then place our order and then waited to be seated. 

When I received my plate of bean spouts, mints, lime and slice jalapenos the portion was the smallest ever for a Pho restaurant. The bowl of pho I received was small with a small amount of meats and was over priced in my opinion. In addition the broth tasted sweet and tasted like sugar was added to the broth!  I don't add any sauces when I eat Pho so this just didn't taste natural at all.

I would not return here again.Horrible service. 1 server doing everything, including hostess. Food mediocre. Definitely not worth a second try.This place is dying a slow death....tons of empty stores litter this outdoor mall and the few surviving stores are empty.  We drove up here on a Saturday and it should've been packed.  I think the outlets in Chandler and Glendale have choked this one to death.  I've spoke to several people who manage stores out here and they said they're not going to renew when their lease is up because they're hemorrhaging money.  That's too bad.

There aren't any premium brands out here to make my drive back worth my while.

Return Factor - 20%Well - they have food that is sometimes decent. 

An order of cheese sticks came out without the cheese on the inside being melted. I politely asked them if they can put it back in the microwave where it came from and they were happy to do so. You could tell the food wasn't just prepared. Chicken wings are pretty good but awfully small compared to many other establishments. 

Service has been hit or miss in the 3 times I have gone here (You got to give everyone a fair chance right?). I think for what they offer and at the prices they offer it for, you would be better off going somewhere else.I was just taking class there for fun but the instructor is not good.

She rarely replies students' email when have question and I know that I am not the only one who has problem with that.

SighThis was the 2nd time I've golfed at Dobson Ranch.  The first time we decided not to go back.  They cram too many people on the course, which just makes the day drag along.

This time the course wasn't busy but when we get there we find out that they are over-seeding so tee-boxes can't be used, and that the carts could not leave the path.  And to top it off, no cart girl on a day it was 98 degrees.

Wow, that would have been important information when the reservation was made a week or two prior.  I went in a group of 9 (a group of 2, 4, and 3) for some birthday golf, which is the only reason I came back to this place.  We had 2 seniors behind the group that called to complain so from early on we had rangers busting our balls. 

 Rather than try to get us to enjoy their miserable course and conditions, they decided to make it even more obvious that a group spending $200 ($28per person for a round) on golf and another $100 at the bar/restaurant on a Tuesday was not worth their time.  They should have been throwing vouchers and coupons at us to come back and apologizing for the conditions and the lack of notice but they didn't do that.  This place lacks even mediocre customer service.  They cater to the guys golfing with a senior discount.  If you are looking to have any fun (ie talking, socializing, smiling) and not take your golf so serious, go elsewhere.

Memo to Dobson Ranch.  If you want us to take our golf as serious as a professional, start treating customers professionally, and have a respectable course.  I would prefer any of the several muni's in the area that give you twice the value, and twice the service.

Icing on the cake is that hole 1 and 10 are right next to the range.  There is no net to keep the multitude of range balls from littering the course.  Do they care?  No.  Literally every place we took a shot from, the sprinkler went on.  This happened to both groups.  We think they were doing it on purpose (conspiracy? maybe), it was crazy how they would go on and off as we would get closer and farther away from them.  We had to run back to the cart several times to save phones/cameras.  The cherry on top was when I went in to get a cup of ice from the bartender after our round and she tried charging me 50 cents even though the guy she just replaced was giving them to us at no cost all day.I went in with high hopes, the decor was fun and certainly a hit with the collage crowd.
The people were nice and friendly, and I will always be a fan of a place that let's their freak flag high! And the folks working here sure do. +1 to me

My "beef" is the food. it was tasty, just fine, but the garlic bread tasted a tad stale, and I found the amount of meat per sandwich to be a little low. (I ordered a Chronic roast bef... sort of a basic sandwich which lets me see the basics of a place.
Perhaps next time I'll read deeper and try another 'wich and ask for extra meat and cheese. Perhaps their a place that only fly's when doing an insane sandwich, I dont know.


I do know that if I could, I would open up a few of these myself near collages, along with Magic Mushrooms Pizzerias and watch the $$'s roll in. 

It's like printing money.

Based on reviews, I'll try this one again, perhaps it was a bad day? Bad choice on my part? I'm open to it.
Or, it might just not be to my palette.Got soft tofu soup.
They mixed up our order.
My bf thought his soup was bland while I was burning up and breathing fire lol.
The food was mediocre, aside from the mix-up.
Priced a lot higher than what its worth.
Small portions.I also had the same experience as another reviewer on here, not good. I was sent to the new Chandler location, though. I ended up with a huge bill and I was supposedly "in network" with great insurance that I've never had a problem with. The doctor had a bad bedside manner too, which I found weird. They spent 5 minutes in the little room with me and referred me out which costed even more. I will be finding a doctor that does more extensive testing in-house and doesn't play the "referral game" to help their specialist buddies and empty your pockets. The only good thing I can say (that got them 2 stars) is the flexible last minute scheduling.Before coming here I made sure to check prior Yelp reviews for suggestions on what to get. Unfortunately I came here with a large party so they had a special "buffet" menu for groups over 50.

The first appetizer was a cheese- filled ravioli topped with red sauce, which wasn't bad. Our table was a bit put off when the waiter told us, "only one ravioli per person." The second appetizer option was a slice of tomato with mozzerela topped with tomato salsa, which would have tasted much better on toasted bread. Tomato on top of tomato is a bit too much. The salad had a very light dressing and slice of tomato on the side, which wasn't too bad. The restaurant must be overloaded with tomatoes.

For the main course I ordered salmon with vegetables and my friends ordered chicken and pasta. Neither finished their meals but I was able to eat the salmon. The portions were small and very unsatisfying. I did enjoy the cream lemon and herb sauce and capers with salmon, but the portion was barely larger than the palm of my hand.

For dessert they served tiramisu which was delicious but had a lot of flavor, which almost washed away the rest of the flavors we'd tasted before.

I didn't really expect much going in, but at least the atmosphere is very nice. Classy decor and waiters were helpful in retrieving drinks and whatnot. The drinks themselves were not that strong. Overall it was an interesting experience but I wouldn't want to go back unless they were definitely serving salmon.be really careful....I called prior to the date that is required to cancel my kids swim lesson for the next month. ...let them know that the end of the month would be her last........the more Mature woman Annette said she was sorry....never told me I had to come in and fill out the form that they don't take it over the phone....I was charged in October- and my kid didn't even go.....I asked for them to remove this charge and she said that she would have told me-it was my fault............now how can I prove that she never said anything.......really bad customer service, and her instructor wasn't great......took her to a Aqua Tots.........so much betterMy lease is up in a couple months and I can't wait to get out of this place.  When I came to check out the property at first, everything seemed great.  The lady I talked to was super nice, the staged apartment looked nice (of course) and it just seemed like a place I would be happy to live in.

On the day of my move in, one of the ladies in the office drove me to my apartment for a walkthrough.  I immediately notice a pretty obvious stain on the carpet in the living room, she says she'll tell the maintenance and have it fixed before I come back (I had to leave to get my stuff and come back).  Of course it wasn't when I came back, I'm just waiting for them to try and charge me for it on move out....

A couple months back I woke up and discovered that my water was shut off.  I pondered for a minute trying to see if I had forgotten to pay my water or accidentally turned it off, I hadn't.  So I call the office to see what's going on and the woman who answered says, "Oh, you didn't get the notice?"  Uhhhhh, no.  That's why I'm calling you.  APPARENTLY the night before (around 7-8pm according to her) they put notices on everyone's doors letting them know that the water was going to be shut off for a few hours due to emergency problems with something.  When I asked why I didn't receive one, she made excuses about neighbor kids possibly taking the notice down or maybe it's because they used an outside vendor to put the notices up.  Wow, thanks for taking responsibility for this, not having water is kind of a big deal that I would have liked to know about ahead of time.

Within the last couple weeks they've been doing quite a bit of construction, a good deal of which occurs right outside my bedroom window.  You would think that if you're going to be using a bulldozer or other such loud construction machine that you would wait until a semi-reasonable hour to do so, so as not to wake your tennants.  That thought obviously never crossed the minds of the management company as I'm usually awakened around 8am.

Last week, the water was shut off AGAIN!  This time I did receive a notice (small consolation) but the fact that my water has been shut off twice in a matter of months due to no fault of mine bothers me.  I'm definitely counting down to my move out date.Had the crepegg - sort of a crepe with an omelet in it. The food was ok nothing special. The coffee was ok as well. If I need to go to a breakfast chain again I think I'll chose the nearby IHOP over the good egg. The booths are massive and can easily fit six people comfortably. I didn't have the pancakes but thought it was weird that they charge extra if you want the real maple syrup.Pizza was okay, tasted a lot like Peter piper. Just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat. Crust was super super salty. There are many other pizza places I would eat at before I would get this. Jimmy and joes pizza blows this away. If you looking for just okay pizza at a good price this is for you.Overstock of large birds with behavioral issues. Poor feather conditions. Generally dirty and large, beautiful birds are waiting to lure you close to try to bite you. On any walk through, I usually can't find more than 2 that I can handle without issues. Many smaller birds are kept in fish tanks like hamsters and they fear hands. many items are overpriced and when asked why they were selling expired dried bugs I was told why not the birds will still eat them? Six months later the same expired Bag'o Bugs were still out for sale.

Staff will answer questions if you ask. They usually will not ask you what you need.

This is not the only bird store in Mesa.This was xmas day and not much else was open.  The place wasn't very full so I got coffee pretty fast.  It was only a third of a pot and luke warm.  I initially had one waitress who got me the coffee and told me another waitress would be serving me.  She never showed up and the first waitress finally took my order.  I got the five cheese omlet, and it was ok.  

I never was asked if I wanted another pot of coffee.  But it was xmas so..............This Macy's is going out of business, so prices were slashed 50-70% off "retail." However, when I checked the sale price against the Amazon price, the difference between the two was so slight I felt it wasn't worth it. I also noticed that the Macy's "retail" price was raised considerably compared to the Amazon retail price- very suspicious!

We went to the rug section to browse the different sizes and styles, and the associate there had the gall to insinuate that I can't afford their items by saying that I shouldn't waste my time on the rugs further down the pile because they were more expensive. Based on my experience here, no wonder they are going out of business!Was here for lunch on 5/5. Always had great food here In the the past. But this time the salad was not good. Appeared to have been partially frozen and then thawed. Very mushy. Soup was good but deep fried asparagus was stuck together in a  block. Server was excellent.Went here to get my daughter a special outfit for her class recital. I was very disappointed. This store is great if you want to get regular dance clothes (tights, leos, etc.) but you will be paying an arm and a leg for them. 

I live in S. Scottsdale and normally go to Barry's Capezio, but I didn't make it by closing time (Dees is open 2 hours later.) However; Dee's wasn't worth my time. I walked out not finding what I was looking for, and I was extremely disappointed by the selection. The staff came out to point to the kids section and then went back into a back room. 

I'll be going to back to Barry's Capezio tomorrow. Their selection is much bigger with a better variety, and the prices are at least 1/2 of Dee's Dancewear. The staff is much friendlier at Barry's too.I receive text messages from sonic with promotions re: new items , specials of the day etc.

I was in the mood for a sundae and went to grab one for me
And a friend of mine.  When I mentioned the special price they said they werent 
Offering that price. Once I explained it was a text/club prIce they asked me to pull forward.

After all 4 employees looked at my text message and they had their little pow wow they decided to give me the price.

When they handed me my sundaes, honest to God they basically took one sundae and split it into two! 

So they scammed me but whatever !

I will Think twice about this location the next time I want to make an ice cream run!

I mean
Come on, even at half price sonic your not losing and dinero dayumBack in 1994, my dad and his friend took me and my sisters to Nielsen's to try frozen custard for the first time.  From what I remember, it's more rich, much creamier than ice cream or frozen yogurt.  Since then, I've never been able to find anything that comes close to that creamy, custard-y frozen goodness.  Apparently it's not that common here on the west coast.

Last I went back, because I had to have that smooth chocolate cone once more.  There was a wait, which wasn't uncommon, being summertime in the AridZone.  There wasn't a nice little old lady helping us; instead there were teenagers running about behind the counter.  The entire place, small as it was, felt kinda...sticky, I suppose.  The napkin counter was gross from melted messes and grinder condiments.  I tried to hide my slowly-growing disappointment until I could taste the frozen custard I once knew long ago.  Unfortunately, the custard itself was just not the same.

It tasted like plain ol' chocolate ice cream.  There wasn't anything custard-like about it.  :(

**Upon searching for reviews on the Net, I found that the Neiesens had sold the shop to a different owner, which would explain the downfall of  my favorite dessert spot.  However, they've recently gained ownership once again, this of course after my unfortunate visit last year, but I have high hopes!  Although I have few reasons to ever find myself in Arizona again, at least I know there's one thing to look forward to if it happens.We had passes for a screening of "The Internship".  This was our first time here.  But it was not our first screening.  So we had definite expectations about how the screening would be handled.

They didn't seem to be well-organized at managing the screening line, nor the "VIP" screening folks.  It was not quite a mosh-pit, but it wasn't orderly either.

The theater itself was small.  The screen wasn't impressive.  The sound wasn't impressive.  It wasn't horrible, but not as good as other theaters I've been to.  

The one really positive thing was the seating.  The seats were comfortable, and there was noticeably more leg room here than any other theater I've been to.  The space between rows clearly is significantly larger.  People can walk by you and you don't even have to move.  I wish all theaters had that much separation between rows.  It was great.

I didn't get any snacks so can't comment on the concession stand.This particular Petsmart is for the birds! It's not very clean or organized. The aisles are very narrow. They do have a lot of aquarium items, including fresh water fish. Would like to see them make it a little more user friendly.

Most Petsmart's are the same unfortunately.Mmmhhhh... It was okay.  The orange chicken was good; everything else is better at Hunan VIII across the street.Thank God, it wasn't busy because the service was so slow.  Manager was not impressive, she ignored that I was standing in front of the register and helped the next person in line then when that customer insisted I go first she acted like it was such a big deal to delete part of the previous customers order.  She actually glared at me?!  

Bagels were stale and blah as usual.  I hate coming here and I only come here to satisfy my kids.  

This store also doesn't deliver the bagels to your table.  They acted like I was self entitled when I raised hand at my table after my name was called.  Another glare from the manager followed by a "there is no way in hell l'm delivering these to your table look".  

Awesome!arena was too big and the equipment was faulty. Went there with a group of friends a year back and there were only 10 of us in the game, i went most of the time in there just looking for someone to shoot. On my pack the sound was out, and I couldnt tell when i was shooting or had been shot. Better options out there, and some not too far away.I read the other Yelp reviews while I was sitting in this restaruant.  Too late. 

Here's the deal - the other reviews are spot-on about the service.  Friendly, happy, and attentive.  

The food though, is NOT so fantastic.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle and my hubbie ordered French Toast.  Both tasted deep fried, which is totally weird.  The butter was in little sealed Shamrock Farms tabs on the table, and was not kept cold, which I found extremely odd.  I mean, overall, the food was okay, but I woudn't recommend it to a friend, so I don't recommend it to you.  Everything came out ordered the way we ordered it, but it just wasn't that great.

The restaurant was clean, but our waitress had animal hair on her black t-shirt, which unnerved me more than a little.Went here to eat tonight for dinner. Our fault for coming right in the middle of dinner rush but didn't think the wait would be too bad as we sat in the bar area. It took a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. The olive oil without our bread was the first red flag. More than 5 minutes later possibly more our bread came. Our drinks arrived 20 minutes after that. We were there a good hour before we actually got our entrees and the icing on the cake were the people who sat down behind us a good 30-40 minutes after we arrived got their food first. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo and pasta Milano. The waiter asked if we would like Parmesan and I stupidly said yes. I watched him go to get it but also watched him stop at two other tables and do other things in the process. A manager came over apologizing because he understood we waited so long for our food. I can only assume our food was sitting the pass forever before the waiter brought it to us. And the manager took less time to go get Parmesan but by the time he got back, our waiter finally remembered to come back with it. Again, I understand that they were busy and I know they are running around constantly but this was ridiculous. It just seemed like our waiter wasn't too concerned with how long we were waiting. Two stars for the manager caring more. The people sitting at the actual bar were getting better service!!

Update 5/14: just found out that this place has closed.Not horrific but this isn't the same restaurant that I used to get exceptional cuisine from years ago during lunch hours.  Décor still looks great and the place is clean which is a definite bonus.  Too many disappointing visits as of late when it comes to what is being served out of the kitchen and culminating with my last visit this past week.  Cold food and indifferent service.  I wonder how long this location will last?My husband and I usually stop at this chilis when we do go. We usually don't have a bad experience, but today I went with my family and the overall experience was not good. The chips and salsa were great.. But they always are! There were not that many people on this Sunday afternoon but our server was not very attentive.. He was friendly of course but walked by us several times at a decent pace while we had empty drinks. Our food was brought out by someone different who didn't ask us if we needed anything else along with our meal. He walked away relatively quickly but he too was very friendly. Our server never came to our table after the food was served to ask how it was or if we needed anything. We had to get his attention because of course we did have a small request. My chicken was a bit too salty.. And I rarely say that because I love salt! They also had arizonas fox center playing on the tv and speaker.. Then about 25 minutes in we noticed that it was just on repeat? Not sure why but we had to listen to the entire broadcast twice. Then toward the end, a group of employees sat in the booth behind us and started talking relatively loud and cussing.. Now granted I understand I was sitting in one of the booths on the bar side my younger sister, but considering there was no one there.. I felt that it was not necessary to yell. We don't eat at chilis very often but when we do return I will consider a different location.I will never eat at On the Border again unless someone else is paying for it.  The service here was terrible and once we were seated our chips were too salty to eat.  The food was nothing like what I was looking for in a Mexican food restaurant.  

This was one of the first restaurants I ate at after moving out here a year ago.  I'm still on the search for great Mexican food in the Mesa/Gilbert area.

I know people that really like this place, but I'm not one of them.Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last.Took me 20 minutes to find what I needed - just a small package of rare earth magnets. Came in when they were busy so it was hard to get a hold of someone to help me, which is understandable. However, if the store was organized in a way that made sense, I wouldn't have needed any help. Rare earth magnets? Not in the section marked "magnets." Another customer helped me locate them... Next to the scissors. I would say I won't be back but Home Depot doesn't carry rare earth magnets... So I guess Harbor Freight may get another chance to impress me.I love this kind of place. 
Unassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat.
The wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave.
The Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times) 
When brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from "giant" but a solid diner burger.
Fresh fries, nice hot, and crispy.
Hot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.

So hey buddy... whats up with two stars?
The burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)

Then I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it. 
Like greasy tears.

Perhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,, 
I wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me.Yet another corporate restaurant that loves to play musical chairs with their menu.  Seems month to month you don't know what they'll remove and what new thing they'll add.  Think about it, a class A restaurant that actually does make a good burger doesn't need to play hide and seek with their menu items . . . ever!

If I were to rate Red Robin burgers over other burgers I've had in my life, I'd give them around a 5/10.  They are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor.  I did enjoy a pot roast burger they used to make, but good old corporate idiots took it off the menu.

The main thing with any Red Robin is it's all about atmosphere and friendly service, which they do rate a 10 in that department.  Unfortunately, the food is nothing to write home about.  There's literally nothing on their menu that I would find so good it's addictive, and isn't really, really good food what a restaurant should be about?  It's kind of sad, really.  They do have all the right flair and decent service, but the food is so corporate average that it makes the rest of the experience dull.I've had many problems with the service at this location.  The employees are nice but they regularly mess up my order and the bun's on the hamburgers are always soggy.  They also usually take a long time to get my order out to me.  I'd actually recommend eating at the Burger King on Country Club and I-60 instead.Service has changed at this store over the years, good luck checking out in any reasonable length of time.  Be sure the charges are correct too, while you are at it.
When shopping here, the system is clearly designed to keep you in the store longer.  It is more difficult than necessary to find a specific book, as subject matter is spread over several small sections in various aisles rather than in one place.  I get the idea of wanting people to linger, but it is so chaotic to find anything that, in my case, it has the opposite effect.  There are a lot of books though, will give you that.
Their buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.  Less than 5 percent of their half price resale, not the original price.  Insulting.  Worst offers include a $40 brand new release hardbound for 50 cents, hardbound new release still in the plastic for 75 cents, and so on.  Save your books and sell at a garage sale, seriously!
  
I've been a frequent shopper at bookstores in many cities, this one scores at the bottom for overall experience.  Any mom and pop is better.Target corp needs to take a look at this location. It's way past its prime. Feels more like a Walmart. I suggest you Yelp for another Target in your area and stay away from this one.Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay $30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a $9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well.So sad to see this place going downhill. Over the last year the hostesses and servers have really been downgraded. From waiting over 40 mins for a patio table with no one in front of us. We sat outside and watched another group simply walk right onto the patio, we asked the hostess about it and she stated they sat themselves. Once we were finally seated it took a server 15 mins to even greet us. They had brought chips but no drinks. After nearly 15 mins of waiting again we got up and left. It was simply ridiculous! I should mention too, this was middle of the week and we arrived a few minutes before 5pm. 
A time prior to that I had to ask a server twice for a refill on my water. After 10 mins or so I went to the bar myself to get my refill. Any time we sit on the patio the servers there are miserable! This is our draw to the restaurant too so it is rather disappointing.
Onto our food, it seems I can never get what I order. I ask for two enchiladas, one white sauce and one red sauce. One of each, not to complicated, I have NEVER been served exactly that. Then I am waiting on my food while the rest of my family eats. 
It seems like there is extremely high turn over for patio servers as well. Which would explain the bad service.
The only reason I gave two stars was the food. While it isn't right, it's always good and so are the alcoholic drinks. 
So sad to drive here from San Tan Valley for such disappointment.I realize it's very close to the holiday, but seriously staff your store. I needed thunb tacks.Could  not find one employee on the floor. Resorted to waiting in a check out line, I ask the cashier., she  points randomly to the back of the store and begins to check out the customer behind me......Slow in getting our food. It took over 30 minutes after ordering and we arrived before noon. We will not return.Institutional food at best. Sevice was great, but not enough to overcome the food quality. This is mac n cheese with powdered cheese, pudding from a can, cheesecake with a slight chemical taste?, etc. Sorry guys, your great but your food is not unfortunately.I try over and over to like Kmart, but it's just not there :(

I do like the sales and the merchandise that is headed out and reduced a lot! When I do go to Kmart I always walk out with something, but I don't go there for the purpose of buying anything.

Today we went looking at Back Packs, found one and waited 15 minutes in line to check out. I stood there thinking is this really worth me saving $6.00? Since my daughter loved the back pack we stayed in line, but really? They had 2 registers open, the one I wasn't in had an individual on a shopping spree, so that lane was definitely out! My lane was just dog slow! I was the 3rd person in line, but each item seemed to take forever to go through. I stood there staring at the customer service area where a cashier stood just looking around bored to death!

I don't think they do a good job of customer service and getting you in and out effectively. 

The store needs a complete over haul and clean up. The parking lot is easy to get in and out of though.Very long wait (even though we arrived early and there were few waiting), extremely slow service, food was tasty though.Decided to have lunch at Black Angus Steakhouse so around 12:20p.m. on a Saturday I popped in.  Waited about 5 minutes for a host to come an greet me.  No one ever came.  I looked down the isle and noticed a server leaning on against a table, opposite from dining guests,  having a conversation.  I could see no one at the bar or anywhere else so I just proceeded toward the restrooms to take a break and wait for the host to return.  I came back to the front and STILL NO HOST.  So, I figured I'd possibly get service if I went to the bar.  

The bar was empty, no patrons, no bartender.  (After my experience I can understand why!)  I sat down and a few minutes later the bar tender returned and greeted me with the usual, "Want a beer or Margarita?"  I told him I preferred the wine list and wanted to take my time looking at the menu for something to pair with the wine.  He understood, provided the menus and I made a decision.  When he returned, I ordered a glass of Ecco Domani - Pinot Grigio 2011 Pinot Grigio Veneto 2011 and a WEDGE SALAD!  I just asked the bar tender to add chicken.  The Wedge salad was priced at $4.99 and I figured they would up charge a couple of bucks for the additional chicken.

Now the fun part is another person came in ordered their drink and meal, it all arrived very quickly, and they began their meal and the bartender hung out visiting with them.

I wait, wait, and wait.  Finally an entree arrives and as they bring it to me I realize....It's not a wedge salad!  They excuse themselves and take the entree to the other person at the bar.  Now, I've waited and waited, from the beginning, to find an employee to provide me a table, take my order, and now they STILL haven't brought me a SIMPLE Wedge salad!!

The bartender mumbles that my order will be right out and I complain, " Wow, they must have gone to Safeway to buy the lettuce just make a simple salad!"  He responds, "Yeah, they also had to chase down the chicken, kill it, gut it, clean it, and cook it too!"  (This is supposed to be funny but guess what?  I'm not laughing!!)

Finally the salad arrives and it's HUGE!  Much bigger than a lunch size WEDGE Salad but I'm tired of waiting and decide to dig in.  After a few moments a man comes over to me and asks how everything is?  I tell him I don't understand how my Wedge Salad turned into a COBB SALAD when I plainly told the server I wanted the Wedge Salad but just add chicken.  I also mentioned that the price was now more than double!  He made excuses about the pricing but for the most part really didn't care that I had been over charged. 

I finished my COBB Salad, glass of wine and decided I would probably not go back or take friends and family to this Black Angus restaurant!!  In my opinion all you will get is lousy service, overpricing and an unhappy experience!!If you have time to kill, you will be just fine...employees at this joint are not, I repeat ARE NOT, going to break thier neck to help you, take your order, etc.  They are getting paid by the hour and making it real obvious...but anyway brand new remodel so it looks snazzy, and food wise got exactly what I ordered and how I wanted it...when I finally got it...In impressed! 6/3/14 The staff were less than happy to see me. The sandwich was small and there is too much cinnamon in there sauce. The pulled pork was lacking flavor. Fries were ok.I am actually very surprised that I am writing cross words about Best Buy but I am going forward.  We purchased a TV last week.  This TV was not in stock and had to be ordered and delivered.  It was set up for 9/9/13 for delivery.  On Saturday the 7th, we were called by Best Buy to confirm delivery between 11:30 and 1:30.  Great!!

So, we took Monday the 9th off, prepared the entertainment center for the new TV, removed the old TV and all the wires, plug ins, dismantled the surround sound, etc.  As anybody knows, this is a time consuming job but we did it to prepare for a quick delivery and installation.

At 1:30, no TV.  So we called.  We were told by Best Buy the delivery is set for 9/11/13.  Uh no..... we have paperwork and a phone message stating otherwise.  The young man on the phone decided to give me attitude about this change and told me to be quiet, simmer down and listen to what I need to do next.  Yea.  He said that.  I got a phone number to the warehouse and was told, "The truck didn't show up today."

Really?  A trucking company is OK with a truck driver not showing up?  Really?  

Off to the store I went and spoke to Manny, the store manager.  Good guy and doing the best he can do with a situation that is obviously a lie and somebody dropped the ball pretty badly.  Found out the TV just didn't make it on the truck for whatever reason and the when I called angry, well.... the TV was put on a late truck for arrival that evening.  Really.  

Finally, at 8:30 in the evening, we drove 40 miles to pick up our TV at the warehouse and installed it on our own.

I'm not comfortable with the lies Best Buy told us and even less impressed with the customer service provided with the exception of Manny, the store manager of the Fiesta Mall location.I went here for a groupon and got suckered into upgrading services. I was not impressed with the services and should have just stuck with the regular car wash.Ray took longer than he said originally and charged us more than we were quoted.We got there at 8:11 and didn't leave until 10:30 because it took the waiter at least 5 times to get Everyones order right. It took probably until almost 10:00 for everyone to get their food. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because the sushi was great and I got it after a reasonable amount of time. I would only go back here to sit at the sushi bar because they were good and the sushi chefs looked like a good time to have conversations while you eat.Not sure how anyone can really enjoy deep dish pizza...waaaaaayyyyyyy too much crust to eat.  It's kind of like eating a loaf of bread.  

Their thin crust pizza is serviceable.This practice has lots of issues.  My wife and I used multiple doctors at this place and had issues with them.  They are almost always consistently late with their appointments.  So don't ever plan anything around your appointment, you will be late.  This place will also extort money from you for any professional paperwork that is needed.  They will not charge you for it at the time of the appointment, they will have you fill out your own paperwork and then charge you exorbitant amounts for a doctors signature.

I would recommend finding a different medical group as this place is not where you want to go.Since I have not met my deductable yet, I was trying to get an out-of-pocket price quote. I wanted to know what to expect when getting my bill, even if it was just an estimate. My insurance instructed me to call the doctor. When I called, no one at this practice could help me and the receptionist didn't even direct me to a billing person. She simply said "it is up to the doctor". This is a little frustrating as I did not want to be shocked with a big bill at the end (which did happen by the way).

I took the gamble and made the appointment anyway. Frankly, I was not overly impressed. I felt I was rushed through the entire visit and was basically just referred to specialists for very minor questions. I was also pushed to do a lot of tests that I felt were unnecessary as my issue was pretty minor.

The check-in staff is not very friendly and seem grumpy. The office is easy to get to but the area is pretty sketchy now. 

In the end, I still have questions un-answered and a large bill that I feel was coded in a way to drive up the price.Bad food, worse service.

Waitress took our drink orders, and then twenty minutes later the manager came by to tell us our waitress got busy with another table and he would take our drink orders. Ten minutes later the original waitress came back to get our drink orders. Ummmm.... hello? Finally got our magaritas, which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour.

And everything was slimy. I'm not OCD or anything but I felt the need to get up and wash my hands after flipping through the menu. And after touching the salt and pepper shakers. And after moving the itty bitty little chip basket from one side of the table to the other.

Ordered an appetizer - the Farmer's Market Quesadilla. Plate was hot but the cheese was cold. Vegetables were slimy. Tortilla was burnt. And they didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. We waited what we thought was an acceptable amount of time for someone to stop by and when nobody did I actually got up, walked across the restaurant to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myself.As for the food at Chevy's---I say *meh*.  It's not horrible but it is eminently forgettable.

We hadn't been to a Chevy's in years.  There used to be one in Sterling at the mall but it had long since closed.  We tried it once and the one thing that stuck in my mind was "El Machino"--- the machine that's highly visible by the entrance where you can watch an employee making tortillas.  As a result of El Machino, the tortillas are probably one of the best things about the menu.  Those same tortillas are what is used for the complimentary chips and dip.  Other than that, the rest of their food is *meh*.

We went to the one in Mesa because we were looking for a place that was kid-friendly.  Chevy's fit the bill in that case.  Yet the kids all had---hamburgers!  LOL!

I had a combo platter and chose a chile relleno and a crispy taco with carnitas.  The chile relleno was just ok---I have had far better.  As for the taco---the best part was the carnitas---I have to admit they had good flavor.

Our son-in-law had a chicken burrito and liked it.  My husband had a taste of Chevy's platter---which, well, had a taste of several menu items.  He was not impressed.

I had a frozen margarita which was just OK.   The adults at our table had a good laugh when the waitress carded me!  I'm thinking that this Chevy's got in trouble in the past for serving underage patrons.  I mean---I'm well past the legal drinking age---there's no doubt about that LOL!

Our waitress was friendly and prompt---no complaints at all about the service.

Yet---I can't help but wonder what the attraction to Chevy's is in a place where there is far better Mexican food around...?Wow, what happened? We were SO looking forward to great tex-mex and we left vowing never to return again.

There was one girl waiting the entire restaurant when we got there (4pm on Sun) and she was trying her best to get to everyone. When we finally recieved our order - chx fajitas and the chx salad, 10 mins later my husband had to ask somone for the tortillas and by then, his stuff was cold...all 5 peices of meat and a couple of peppers. My salad resembled a kid's meal - could it get any smaller? Yes, it tasted ok, but between the service and small portions, will definitely not be going back.

Too bad, we really liked Chevy's in CA. Will do Chipotle instead out here.I kinda been hating my last experiences here with my child.  Specially when certain employees seem rude and unhappy of working there. Sad to say that it's a certain manager. The salad  bar is pricey for its quality of vegetables. I get a dry bad tasting lettuce every time I go but then request it to be refreshed.  The games almost never work completely but I had no idea they were so old. I'm thinking they don't want to invest in it anymore. Even the smell of this place is kind of odd. I wonder how often the carpet gets washed. To the other pizza place here I come (except for the salad cause it's bad tasting too)!Disappointing.  

I was looking for the Denny's near here and came across this, ironically in the same center as the "My Arep,a" Venezuelan place I had discovered a couple of weeks ago.  I figured what the heck, I'll get a cheap breakfast here instead of Denny's.  And I know they have good coffee because I buy their ground coffee at Target and WalMart when it's on sale--REALLY good stuff.  But the donut was so much worse than what I've had (seldom) at Krispie Kreme, and the breakfast sandwich was just adequate.  Thank goodness the coffee was still good.  I got the vanilla flavored one and a decaf vanilla for my refill to go.  I doubt I'll go back--to this one or any other if this is a sample of their donuts.  I don't eat them often enough to waste the experience on bad quality.Server was not efficient and didn't seem to have a clue. 

I ordered a Milk Stout that was on the board and she brought me something I wasn't expecting.  She didn't know they had anything else but I sent it back after telling her about the one that's being promoted.
No glass was brought with the beer but I wasn't too concerned with that.
We had a salad before our meal and then husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs, a calzone (?) for my son and pizza for me.
She passed by the table and dropped of condiments -ketchup and mustard.  WHY?

Multiple tvs surrounding the dining area.
I don't recall any volume...
I don't think of this place as a sports bar but with what I saw playing on tv I think it probably falls into that category.

My pizza was primarily crust with sauce and a bit of cheese.  
I had maybe 6 pieces of pepperoni, total, and this was the Classic 
(Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).

The food is okay, but there are so many other places to go in the Valley for food that's "okay".  I would rather hit the Olive Garden or one of the many neighborhood Italian restaurants where the food it better than just okay.I was checked into a room that had not been checked out of..... that seems to be to be not only unprofessional but dangerous. And when I alerted the woman that works at the front desk she seemed to careless. I could understand if I had checked in early in the morning, but I checked in 4. plenty of time to clean the room or check to see if someone was still staying here.
as for the 5 star reviews they all sound fake to me, and sound like a advertisements. who cares about continental breakfast. I also took my shoes off in my "new room" and it is pretty clean that the floors have not been vacuumed in awhile. It seems to me that there should be a round of firings. maybe some fresh blood will shake things up.had the bulkogi mini plate. very cheap at $5, but it's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky. the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the potato-mac salad.Ok.so first visual impression was a regular drop joint hopefully with a good underlining" food".I got there mix plate#2 with beef and chicken katsu w rice and macaroni salad.the chicken tasted like boneless fried chicken cutlets w a side of Louisiana style bbq sauce" instead of katsu sauce,not good,the beef was borderline beef jerky, thinly sliced over sauced beef,some of it was tender,alot of burnt ends and grisly bites,with a copious amount of marinate.left a coating in my mouth,the rice was sticky and clumped apart,the macaroni salad wasn't bad but wasn't good,had to add pepper and there were chunks of russet patotos in it,that was first,and I really wanted the lau lau,but only on Saturdays.as well as kalua beef.I will go back to try the lau lau but not anytime soon.stay classy yelpersThe kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one? 

The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times.

The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?

There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.


12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our "snack" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)This location seems to go through an abnormally large number of new staff constantly. I have not had a problem with getting the correct order, but customer service is very hit and miss.Yelp was not so helpful on our food hunt in Apache Junction. We went on a nice hike and found ourselves very hungry. Rather than driving back to Phoenix to eat, we decided to YELP search out something yummy and well reviewed in the area. Mexican sounded appealing, so Los Gringos won out.

We arrived quickly and found ample parking (as if we wouldn't in Apache Junction). We were seated quickly and offered drinks. About 15 minutes passed without our water. We were quite parched from the hike and the heat and desperately wanted water. Do I need to get it myself? Finally, when I was about to trip the waitress, she noticed us looking like cacti and brought us water. She apologized and took our order. Enchilada Poblano and a grande burrito.

It seemed like forever until our food came. We also had to ask for water refills several times. It seemed like the wait staff just disappeared for long stretches at a time. The wrong dish was served to me, though it ended up looking far better than what did finally arrive. The food was average. I cannot say that I was impressed and I also can not say it was bad. It just filled my belly but did not make me jump for joy. I do not think Mexican usually does, but I was hoping.

Overall, meh is about right. I was terribly disappointed by the service, despite them all being very nice. I just expect to not be forgotten for 10 plus minutes at a time. I will not be back here.... but I will also not likely be back in Apache Junction. I recommend you try another place in Apache Junction, though, if you are looking for something good.I wasn't that impressed.  But we might have just gone on a bad night.  The waiter told us that their computers were down so they were doing everything by hand.  So our waiter took our order (and didn't write anything down).  We got one meal that was slightly wrong (ground beef instead of shredded beef) and our appetizer came out with our entrees.  

The food was just okay...I've had better.  Not likely to go back.Drove in Sunday on my way with my husband for a scenic tour of the Apache Trail and all the wildflowers that are in bloom now...   Driving up to this place I kinda got excited seeing a massive old west looking town right off the road.  After driving on a freeway forever and seeing noting but dirt, rocks and catus this town was like eye candy.  It brought me back to childhood with my imagination of what would have gone on here over a century ago.  Parking was ok, had to wait a couple of minutes for a space but that was ok.  
Walked up and found this town to be a little bit of a let down, right away got the whole Disneyland feel of fakeness.   Guess if I were a kid I wouldn't mind it, but being an adult it was a let down.  Instead of finding museums with history facts of the town it was just cheesy gift shops one after the other.  The stuff they sold was solid junk and made me want to vomit....
We did walk around the grounds and saw antiques baking in the sun laying all around.  They have horseback ridding, but seemed really expensive as far as prices...  Also noticed there was a Mine Tour, a little reptile exhibit and a bordello tour, all of course cost money.  
My husband and I took the bordello tour which was $3 each... we thought that wasn't a lot of money till we got in.  The tour lady told us a quick 5 minute spill of what life was like for these women and then let us roam around the whole three rooms of the tour, which weren't big rooms..  I felt like I was walking through a antique store, because there were price tags to sell all the items on display... It really was tacky... We left thinking Really???  
Then came in the middle of town for a short gun show.  That was a little cute, but a really short act.  We didn't want to eat here so we took off...  We won't be stopping here again...C'mon Yelpers! 4 stars?! No way, jose. This place is nothing special and I suggest, if you are looking for a nice local place to eat in Mesa, you MOVE ON! Initially we wanted to try the little bar next door, but being New Year's Day, it was closed so we settled for this place. We walked into a dingy looking restaurant with old, dusty pictures and knick-knacks nailed to the walls and when we were seated, our server was short with us as if they were about to close and she didn't want us there. We all ordered some beer and I opted for the mug to pour mine out of the bottle. When I received it, however, I opted not to pour it into the mug afterall  because it was so dirty and cloudy that the very thought of drinking out of it was repulsing. 

I wasn't very hungry so I figured the potato skins would be a nice smaller meal but boy was I wrong! I was served 2 full sized russet potatoes, halved and carved out for the cheese and toppings. There was so much cheese on these potatoes that I literally had to take 3/4 of it off just to enjoy the potato itself. Also, they were so greasy that even in the short time we were sitting there the grease was piling up on top of the cheese. Did they even strain the bacon bits? I don't think so... Needless to say, I only ate one and lost my appetite. Also to be noted, the silverware was all spotty and looked like they hadn't seen the inside of a dishwasher/sanitizer in quite some time.

The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because in our rush to get the heck out of there, I left my debit card on the table and the waitress chased us outside to return it. I was incredibly thankful for that!For a dive bar in a one-horse town the Silver Bullet is well, pretty much the only option other than the bar at the hotel I was staying at, which closes pretty early.

Drinks were at a pretty average price, but the locals were a bit routey and eventually got into a pissing contest over nothing, puffing their chests out like a bunch of drunken insecure.. well you get the drift. It was pretty creepy though, I came in with two girls and we were getting eyed down pretty bad. We didnt stick around too long before a bunch of our friends made it before the tension in the air got too thick.

I did enjoy the fact that there was no music playing though, I dont know about you but Im sick of bad music being on everywhere and too loud at that. I get enough of that at the hotel lobby!I'm always looking for a good slice of pizza/italian.  Casa Grande doesn't have many choices.  When I first past by this place I thought - eh what the hell.

You walk in and its a bit dark, a few people lingering at the bar, EVERYONE stares at you like an alien when you walk in.  Very strange, must be a very clickly hangout for the older folk I guess.

Any who....I ordered the spaghetti because its an original recipe. Well it was crap, no really, the noodles were dry, stuck together, and the sauce was so bland and basic that I wondered if it was just a can of tomato sauce and some salt.   

To top it off the waitress was trying to pitch me a sale on a "special price" flat screen tv (which they sell in here) with direct TV (which is also sold here).  Seriously.

I dunno, never been back never plan to.Mi Amigo Ricardo is a local favorite.  Evenings find the parking lot  filled to capacity  so, I was excited when my husband surprised me with an early dinner.
Entering I was impressed with the friendly staff, lovely hand painted murals and overall cleanliness.  We were seated immediately (early Sunday supper), chips and salsa also delivered pronto.    If you ever had Mexican food in the Midwest c. 1968, or your mother attempted Mexican from the Time Life cookbooks this is the fare served at Ricardo's.  Absolutely nothing wrong with this, it is Mexican cuisine  for the timid palate with portions verging on those of most American restaurants.  The salsa (served in little carafes) tasted tenuously spicy (definitely not homemade) and the chips were served in something akin to a child's salad bowl.  We asked for a hotter salsa and were given a delicious jalapeño sauce similar to a cooked pico de gallo: yum!   My husband ordered the Chihuahua plate; shredded beef flautas, rice and beans and I ordered a simple bean and guacamole tostada.  Both plates reminded me of something my mother cooked at home when we lived in Minnesota (c.1968) with no access to authentic Mexican comestibles other than copious amounts of Iceberg lettuce.  I'm not by any means dismissing Ricardo's food. Sometimes a bit of zeitgeist is good for the soul. Also, you cannot discount the friendly, warm and welcoming atmosphere.Food is good but not the waitresses.  Phyco waitress won't refill your coffee.  Weekend waitresses are to busy gabbing about their personal life's.     Service not goodWhat happened to you Outback!? We have been frequenting you for years and the last several times we have been there - were very disappointing!  Food served cold, steaks not cooked to order, and one time we had a very rude Server, (female). Goodbye Outback.The BF and I went here for lunch today as we had purchased a groupon for this restaurant a few weeks back and wanted to go to total wine anyway, which is close to the restaurant, so we headed out. We got to the restaurant and it was not too busy, just a few tables. The restaurant was a nice looking restaurant, it was painted a nice color and had interesting metal wall hangings. We're having pizza for dinner tonight so we decided to get a couple sandwiches and the bruschetta. Our server seemed pretty miserable to be there and had a really flat voice. She was not so pleasant. We got the bruschetta and it was not exactly what you would expect. It was like a cheesy garlic bread with tomatoes, garlic, basil, and their balsamic dressing on it. I thought it was pretty good, although the tomatoes were not so fresh and the bread they chose was odd for a bruschetta. The BF, however, really didn't like it. He thought it tasted 'weird.' So then we waited a bit and our sandwiches came out. Here is the real reason for the bad review. The sandwiches just weren't good. I got the chicken panini and the BF got the meatball parm. The meatball parm was really bad. The sauce had no flavor, the meatballs tasted like they were once frozen, and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, like 3/4 of an inch thick. My sandwich was ridiculous. It was giant and looked like a giant salad on bread. The chicken was a breaded cutlet... not super tasty, and supposedly it had their balsamic dressing on it, but I couldn't taste it. It had a lot of raw red onion on it which took over the flavor, and when I took it off all I could taste was the 'pizzette' bread which was overwhelmingly garlicky. I love garlic, but this was too much. It was almost bitter in my mouth. So maybe their pizza is good... I don't know, but what we got was not good. Like so many restaurants, I think this place could use better ingredients and give you much smaller portions for the same price and it would be a lot better.This place reminds of Wong's Palace in Tempe but not as good.  For some reason, the food just doesn't hit the spot.  The chicken chow fun was tasteless and was just flat out goopy.  All of the noodles just stuck to each other.I've ordered from them several times. All were delivery. Each time the service is worse and worse. They never have rice balls, and when i asked "do you guys only have them every once in a while cause you're were sold out last time too" he replied with " we make them everyday so if we're sold out then we're sold out".. no sh*t if you're sold out you're sold out. i wasnt aware they were made only once a day. it was only 730pm ON A WEDNESDAY, how are you sold out? i dont get how a restaurant would be ok with selling out of a menu item (that they use for two different appetizers). so when i asked if it was ok to take a quick minute to look at the menu to pick a different appetizer, i got a snarky "uhh........... okk" like wtf? i wasnt expecting you to tell me i couldnt get an item i wanted. so be patient when i want to try to order something else... last time i checked, it was the business and its employees' goal to make money. and when i was done with my order i got a "uhhhhh give us like an hour and a half or so.. ok?" i said "ok cool thanks" and he said "ok" and hung up. no thank you, no "this comes to $x.xx" NOTHING. it was just short of being hung up on. the delivery always takes over an hour.. ON A WEDNESDAY nonetheless. 

i will say that the food has never been short of disappointing tho. closest to good pizza i have really been able to find in the direct chandler area. i have never visited to dine in, but at this rate i would hate to attempt that. if their phone service is anything like their in person customer service, i would probably walk out.Gross. I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I'll just merge them.

The market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don't confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he's from Bangladesh. He's an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He's got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you'd really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That's pretty cool.

The restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don't think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, "Hey man, he's usually at the store cuttin' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn't reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I'm being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my 'wrap' was just painful. I'm sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It's like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions).

The owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle. Everyone likes Chipotle, but only some people can stand Filiberto's.35 minutes. That is how long I waited in line to pay for one dress yesterday at this location of Ross. By the time I got to check out there were probably over 30 people in line behind me that wrapped around the store and they were probably in for an even longer wait. I should have just thrown in the towel after 15 minutes but the urge to buy an amazing Calvin Klein dress for $12.99 took over. The staffing and management situation here is absolutely ridiculous. 

During my 35 minute wait I observed many things. There were only two cashiers able to ring up purchases, one who was taking returns only but who did not help purchasing customers at all when no one was in her line. About 10 minutes into my wait in line, one of the cashiers who was ringing up purchases had to clock out for a break or to leave for the day. It seems to me like she was under extreme pressure to clock out because I heard her say "well now I feel under pressure" because it was taking her an extremely long time to ring up the person she was helping because they had a million and one items. I think that the associates are probably under penalty of getting pay docked or getting written up if they don't clock out on time (this is the case in many big box retail stores) which is an absolutely ridiculous policy especially on a busy day. If this is the case, someone should be ready to go right away on another register or a manager should take over because this would leave only one cashier to ring up purchases, and it did. This is when the line began to get ridiculously long and I was happy that i got in line when I did. I observed many associates "lingering" and chatting and while being a cashier may not be their job title, they should not even be in sight while 30 people wait in line thinking, why the hell are they not on the registers. 

At one point an extremely irritated customer yelled out, "why don't you open another register?!?" To which the equally irritated cashier yelled out "a manager is on her way up!" We all waited another 10 minutes, the line moving about one customer every 3 to 5 minutes. I really kept thinking I should just leave but I had already waited so long at that point, which I'm sure is what most people in line were thinking. I observed many new incoming associates clocking in at the front registers but no one stayed to help. I felt really bad for the lone associate ringing people up because lord knows she was going to hear it from all of the extremely irritated customers and it really wasn't her fault at all, she was really the only one there working her butt off to go as quickly as she could.

Finally a second cashier appeared after about 20 minutes of being in line with just the one cashier. They did have about 6 registers in total BTW, that could have been open. The second cashier really took her time to get her register up and running. She was writing things down, looking around and seemed to enjoy that we were all chomping at the bit to be checked out. She had no urgency at all, no respect for her fellow cashier or customers. She opened the register after about 3 minutes of writing something down. The line slowly started moving a little bit. At this point some people had decided to leave but most stayed, irritated and frustrated at the situation. I finally was up at the front, next in line to check out. A loss prevention associate was gathering carts in front of the line and almost rammed one into my side. I redirected the cart right before impact. She very rudely told me that I could have helped her instead of watching her struggle, and biting my tongue I said I was sorry. I really thought to myself that I did help her, from crashing the carts into the crowd and why the hell was she moving the carts at that time anyways in front of a line of over 30 people!!

To sum things up. This store is managed extremely poorly. I feel sorry for the associates who work here and who are probably told off constantly by unhappy customers and by management. I really don't feel like giving money to a store that is so poorly run. I am done with this Ross store.I'm very frustrated with this gym.  The trainers have been hanging around the checkin counter pressuring people to complete a fitness assessment so that they can sell them personal training sessions.  As a member, I know those services are available, and if I want to participate I will ask.  I don't appreciate being hounded while trying to enter the club to workout.  I hope that this stops soon or I will have to seriously consider switching gyms.Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.

Get ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?

One word: disappointing.Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  I've noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, I'll post something that will reflect it.Hubby and I met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight. It is a small restaurant, nothing much to look at, but the service was super friendly and amazingly fast.

I had egg rolls that were pretty awful- inside was a ground up unidendifiable mash. Really couldn't identify the tastes either. Hubby's spring roll was nothing to write home about, and he thought that the ones he had at Pholicious were far better. 

My entree was quite tasty, though- the beef chow fun (dry) might just have been the best I've had in the Valley. Hubby had to add all the sauces given to him just to give his tofu and veggie noodle dish some flavor. One friend loves their curry pho, and the other friend just repeatedly called her dish "spicy" and didn't eat much of it.

We've had better overall and will keep searching for a good pho place- and one in our part of town.These ppl just like the other one down the road,  running a 3ring circus. They couldn't find my son when transferring a prescription, so they made a new profile...and gave him a new name. Then, when we went to get the rx, they couldn't find it. Why? because they had it under his new (female, now) name. !!!???  When they finally got that fixed, they handed me 1 inhaler. Trouble is, the original rx from the other pharmacy was for 3 inhalers. They screwed the transfer up, too, and put it in as 1! That had to be fixed. 

Another time I went in, was waiting in a long line inside to get some sudafed, and some dude walks up to another slot and starts demanding attention. The pharmacist dropped what he was doing for the first ppl in line and took care of the guy, all the way thru to ringing him up! ?? It was Christmas Eve. We were all thrilled in the line, I gotta tell you.

Then, went back again for more inhalers---told the girl my son's name and date of birth. Told her we wanted a refill, for 3 inhalers. Some guy in there was making jokes at her and she apparently can't chew gum and walk, as she fumbled w/ the computer for a while and finally said, what was the patient's name, Maria? Date of birth?  Finally, she said, ready in 2 hours. Ok. Went back in 2 hours and 40 minutes, and the inhalers still weren't done! The tech was unruffled--he's a really good tech, great w/ customer service, but by this time, w/ all the bad things I have had happen to me at both this one and the CVS down the road, I was in no mood to be jovial. Guess how many inhalers they gave me after I had to come back in another 15 min?  Yup---1. I said, um, you're missing 2. Perplexed, he took it back to the pharmacist. They fixed it. They really need more help, and better help, if you ask me.Popped in the other day.  My wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and I got me a chicken caesar salad.  Where to begin?

Lets start with portion size.  We weren't looking for some hefty size portion, but if this was for a grown man, they would have laughed and said thanks for the sampler.  The meatballs were pretty small too, and probably came from a restaurant supply house.

The sauce tasted exactly like they opened up a can of crushed tomatoes and heated it up.  Very bland, no flavor or visible herbs/seasonings.  I'm not a gambler, but I would bet this was a purchased sauce... and being a family owned business, this was quite unexpected.

My salad came out quick... too quick.  My chicken wasn't hot.  It had been sitting around a while.  That made a big difference in taste.  In my opinion, Floridino's has a great chicken caesar salad... BUT only if you get fresh chicken.  Specifically ASK for fresh and hot chicken!  I will.

As we walked out, I noticed a boxing gym in the same strip mall area.  I gots ta check that out.I heard good things about this place. We picked it up for dinner one night. I had meat raviolis. Tasted just like Chef Boy r D from a can. Yuck.The positives: The restaurant is cute. My husband and I were able to find a wine we enjoyed and the chicken pesto was pretty good. 
The negatives: The pizza is way below average. Nothing good to report there. Their customer service is awful - our waiter was so rude. He seemed put out by my son even though the restaurant claims to be kid friendly. He was visibly upset when my son bent their paper menu - he claimed the "owners were going to be upset". Our service went rapidly downhill from there. Guess he never got over the menu.A Dive

Cold cheap domestic beer in a strip mall dive.  Nuff said.had the chicken schwarma. it was too dry.Called ahead on Saturday 3/15 to let them know 10 people would be coming to dinner at 8:15pm.  Person on the phone said they do not take reservations. I said I just thought you might like to know if 10 people are coming. She said she would let someone know.
Show up, hostess was shocked. They put a table together and our server did a good job making sure everyone had what they needed and did separate checks which was above and beyond.
Here's the real reason for this review and I hope someone who has any say in what goes on there gets this message. The lentil fattoush had so much garlic in it, it could have killed a horse. I took 3-4 bites and had dragon's breath immediately. This has always been my favorite dish at PJ, but wow. Yuck. Ruined it for me. 
No goodbye or thank you as the hostess at the podium was on her cell phone as we were all walking out. 
Pita Jungle on Ray. Meh.Caveat: I don't drink coffee (gasp!) so I'll be commenting on every aspect but that. Read other reviews if you want to know how the coffee is.

The biggest selling point of this place is that it's open late. Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone.
The indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks.
Some fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet. And god help you if you kick them way, you'll have to suffer the disdainful looks of the high school girls who often congregate here.
The various non-coffee/tea drinks I've tried aren't good. They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible.
The baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava.
Most of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them. I've also been harassed about ordering quickly, even in situations where the place is relatively empty. Sorry if I don't want to order and have my ice melt before the rest of my friends arrive!

As I said, the primary draws of this place is that it's open late and (for indie types) that it's not Starbucks. But as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't excuse the crappy non-coffee drinks and occasional unfriendliness I've experienced.Good bean dip, OK chips. OK green chile, although they need a medium green option.  I don't understand why when going from CO closer to Mexico I can't find anywhere with mole sauce?Lets face it, no one wants to write a review about her vagina getting checked (TMI anyone?) but as women we need to find places we can rely and trust for all our Gyno needs. This is just my small contribution to it.

I was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test).  I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr.

The office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my ID/insurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded.

I gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well.

I didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy.

Wait.. is that too much to ask?Don't think I'll be back. I just get the feeling they are trying to sell me on stuff I just don't need yet, but I'll bring it to another brake place next week to see if they concur.  I'd hate to cast presumptious aspersions.Went here for my bday last year. We called to make reservations because from what people said we thought it was going to be a busy place and we planned on doing the hibachi grill so we were sure we needed them. When we arrived....there was not a single person in the place, and they had already been open for a couple of hours. Not a good sign. We decided against the hibachi and just went for the all you can eat sushi, which didn't turn out to be any cheaper than just getting a couple rolls of sushi. The food wasn't that great. The service was ok. I wasn't impressed at all...probably won't be back.Alright where to start where to start....

Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it. I have been to some good sushi places that pack a punch in a 4 piece roll. The soft shell crab was okay, but only 4 pieces?!?!!?!?! Like most of their other sushi it was really salty....REALLY REALLY REALLY SALTY. the wasabi had zero potency. The scallops was chopped up...booo, some other places do that too, the worst part was how much salt there was on it. they should have called that a salt roll with a hint of scallops.. BLECH!!!

I also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...

and the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush. 

my over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _"enter random fish name here"___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at allWent here this past weekend and it was NOT a good experience.  The food was ok but the service was horrible as soon as we walked in the door.  Definitely won't be going back.Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you.My first visit here and was hard to find but once it is found you will be glad that its were it is. The grounds are beautiful. The wait was 20 mins to check in for my body scrub. Made them rush me through. They need better organization.  Since I was rushed the treatment was OK. Still enjoyed but I know it would have been better. Next was lunch. Took forever to get seated even with reservations. We got seated outside as we asked.  Took forever to order a drink then forever to get the drinks and when they came, it was wrong so it took forever for them to bring the right ones. Then forever to get food. Food was good.  We got tired of waiting for everything. Went to the manager and told him of our experience. He was apologetic and comped our meal and said they were not serving on the patio.....so why did they fail to mention this as we were getting seated.....I would rename this the Wait Forever resort and spa. That's what we mainly did was wait forever! 

I live so close to this place I wanted to make it a regular but looks like I will go back to Desert Ridge Spa. Never a problem there. They know how to run things.Unfortunately, this auto shop misdiagnosed an issue of front-end vibration at crusing speeds. After checking the car, they gave me about a half-dozen possibliities but could not promise any of the repair items would solve the problem. By contrast, another repair shop pin-pointed the cause, and performed the needed repairs to satisfaction.

However, I will have to give this auto shop credit for having a very comfortable waiting area with leather sofas, lcd tv, wi fi, and gormet coffees.I am a regular at AJ's and have kept quite long enough. But I am tired and often feel dread when I have to go to the Bakery/Coffee section. I have never met a ruder bunch of women. 

I have not once seen them smile and when they take your order they act as if THEY are being put out. I would not care if it were once, twice even, but EVERY SINGLE TIME!!

We often order several beverages at a time and apparently this is just unacceptable to the staff. As someone in the service industry I find it the behavior of the ladies behind the counter, in a word, nasty. 

I know their names and thought of leaving them, but they know who they are. I have a tip for them, if you don't like your job...QUIT!! There are plenty of people that would be happy to work in your spot and would do a great job with a little less attitude.

C'mon AJ's, you're known for snooty customers, is it a prerequisite to work there too?First thing I noticed was the dingy smell when walking into side door of hotel. The whole room is out dated. Not worth the money. I'm surprised this place is in business with all the nice new choices in Chandler.I am not an apple user but I came to this store with a friend and spent two plus hours here today.  This experience left me with a lot of questions.

Why do they feel the need to blast pop music over the speakers throughout the store?

Why don't they have any sound dampening insulation in the walls or ceiling to help mitigate the noise of 100 plus people trying to talk over the blaring pop music?

Why don't they have some kind of queueing system to allow the aforementioned 100 plus people there on a random Saturday to ask questions of a sales person on a first come first serve basis?

Why are all the staff hipster teenagers who seem to know little or nothing about the products they sell or technology in general?

Why do these empty-headed hipster teenagers feel the need to make YOU feel like you are the one who has the problem, not the product or device you are trying to use.

Why didn't they have the a/c in the store cranked up to max considering that it was 100 degrees outside and the place was filled with 100 plus customers and a bunch of "genius" hipster teenagers.

I know, I know, Best Buy is not any better.  Not one bit.  But based on all the zealous iworship of the almighty Apple, I was expecting more.I've been to this store twice and both times left with a bad taste in my mouth. The employees don't seem to care if you buy a computer from them or if you get he help you need whit he computer.  Hope this isn't a sign of things to come for Apple...Ah, good ol' 5 and Diner. We walked in and were greeted and seated almost immediately. To my horror we were seated by a Breeder and her 5 kids. One of the kids thought that the restaurant was her playground. She was running and screaming from the juke box back to her table. Honestly, I would have given the place a 3 if a manager had asked the lady to control her spawn. It was an accident waiting to happen and I couldn't hear what my lunch partner was talking about.

 I initially went in for a big, juicy burger, but my buddy and I saw a couple breakfast platters go by and it instantly changed our minds. I ordered eggs Benedict which came with a side of hash browns. I also ordered a slice of sourdough french toast. Well after a few mix ups with having to make sourdough french toast, I finally told the waitress to just give me a slice of regular french toast. The eggs Benedict were meh, the hollandaise sauce came out of a packet, I think, but Hey I was at a 5 & Diner. The french toast was very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. yum. 

My pal had a giant waffle with eggs and a side of hash browns. He said that everything was perfect. The waffle wasn't too dry and crispy, and his hash browns were cooked perfectly.

Will we go back? Maybe. We will certainly ask for a table far from kids. Maybe that will bump this place up to 3 stars!The quality of food has gone down.  Very greasy.Have been coming here since they opened.  The last six months or so something has changed.

The quality of the food and service has suffered.

One time I was meeting a friend for lunch and had to call the manager out to the dining area because the music was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.

Another two times the rice was under cooked.

Portion size is way down.

Employees back talk you when you ask to have a kids meal made a particular way due to a finicky eating child.

I think I'll start driving out to the Chandler mall location.Love, love, love BBW! I was going to purchase the car freshers and I went into grab 4 (buy 4 get 2 free) and the associate came looking over breathing down my clavicle , scapula and humerus area! Like WTF did you think I was stealing? I was going to just put the items back and go to another BBW but I decided to just make my purchase and get out of that store.Food was tasty but the service sux!  I visited @ 3pm on a tuesday ... My server was also handling host ane bartender duties.  Long long long long wait for condiments and extra biscuits.  Tick tick tick down went the tip!  Service is poor to say the least"Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have.

"Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner" Mom says beaming.

At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her...

Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...

I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.

The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.

I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. 

I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. 

I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. 

It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant.

 Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area.Was good food. Employees uniformed one tells you one thing and the other says otherwise. Really annoying. Tables next to the kitchen are way too loud. I wouldn't recommend the chandler site. Maybe the Phoenix store is betterI am not a fan of Kona Grill and it really baffles me as to why this place is always so packed. They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss. The same with the service from the waitstaff in the dining area. The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while. 

I guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison. I would definitely rather go here than Cheescake Factory or that new Old Spaghetti Factory (horrible!) but there are a lot better places out there once you escape the confines of the mall.Excellent ambient, nice place. Good foodHorrible Service.  I have not been to a kona grill in some time due to gluten free restrictions I have to take into account starting a few years ago.  We were shopping in the area and seen they now have a dedicated Gluten Free menu.  When we arrived we asked the hostess if we could view the menu first just to see what options we had.  She was fairly rude, gave us one menu (for 3 people to look at) and walked away.  We decided to stay and eat and then got a server who obviously had no idea about gluten free.  We became an inconvenience for him.  He didn't know any details, didn't offer to ask, and then offered to do a side of fried rice (we've had this gluten free at other places).  About 35 min later I believe the manager, who by the way saved this from being a 1 star review came to our table.  Very nice and asked about our gluten free request.  We let him know we have to eat gluten free.  He then stated that the fried rice Is not gluten free and offered to give us something else.  What I failed to mention before is that when we ordered we asked if we could do a side of fruit with our  turkey burgers.  We were told "No" we don't have that as an option.  Back to the manager, he said we can do vegetables or fruit for you.  Awesome we will take the fruit we said.  We wanted to order that originally but were told you don't have that.  The manager said they do and will take care of that for the future guests to know.  The meal ended up being good, we got what we wanted, but the service was horrible and two out of the three employees treated us like we were weird people due to our food requirements.This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.

As is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.

But then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.

The selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes.Nothing too new to add to the reviews of Abuelos... beautiful restaurant with mediocre, watered-down Mexican food. 
On the positive side, at least they have several decent vegetarian options. On the negative side, all of those options are loaded with greasy cheese and have very little seasoning.
The sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick.

Yet another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Phoenix - then again, I should have known better. It is a huge, corporatized chain outside a shopping mall...The experience would have been a lot more enjoyable if I wouldn't have had to get my own refill of water and eat chip crumbs. The chile rellenos and beef tacos are good though.Abuelos has been there for a long time but for some reason I have never been there. So I decided to try it. Walking in, I was very impressed with the decor - looked like the Cheesecake Factory - or maybe a casino. Sat at the bar and started with a margarita. It was ok. Tasted a little watered down. I had 2 of them - which usually does the trick for me - these must have been really light on tequila because I did not feel the alcohol. They brought chips and 3 salsas. The salsas tasted out of the can - and chips were out of a bag- not much taste. I had a combo with enchilada, tamale, taco, rice and beams. The taco beef tasted like Taco Bell but it did have nice lettuce and tomato - the shell was crisp. Tamale tasted like out of a can although it was sitting on a husk. Avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese- the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor. The rice and beans were tasty.  I kept waiting for something to kick in after I finished my 2nd drink - it felt like I had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down. My bill was $31. - after tip I walked out spending $36 for a below average meal. Abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest Mexican food.  Go down to Rositas on Dobson/Guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food, chips/salsa, and drinks blow this place away.  Mexican food should have some flavor - Abuelo's is overall very bland.Went here after a basketball game.  It was late but well before closing time. Service was a little slow.  But that wasn't what bothered me.  When they brought out the pizza.  A huge cockroach crawled out from under the tray.  Grossed me out.  Never came back since.I agree with the last reviewer, this Baja is going downhill. Baja was always  like the more beautiful, delicious cousin of Rubio's (if you consider your cousin delicious). I received my quesadilla and while it usually has a few types of cheeses in it, this one had some rubbery cheese in it with very little cheese in it, like they were cutting back or something. The queso fundido tasted fake, like a plastic doll accidentally dripped overhead into it or something. Ehh, I don't think so...Ew.

Wendy's used to be my favorite fast food restaurant.  WTF happened to their hamburgers?  They taste like beef-flavored mud with condiments now.  Their fries are terrible too as of late.

What's not terrible is their service.  This is the fastest service and delivery of food that I have ever seen from a fast food joint.  Five stars for service.  Unfortunately, I cannot rate by service alone.  Yuk.katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.

let me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar. 

 i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink. 

katie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked,
"are you going to get a drink?"
"ya, if he ever comes back" was her response

then i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point. 

another 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips. 

then we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread! 

so our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.

then, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming

the chips and salsa were not good. 
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.

if you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.

2 stars for service
2 stars for food on this trip(usually i would give it 4)
2 stars for sunday morning ambiance(dinner is the time to go here)I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me.I ordered the avocado roll as usual but this time it was complete mush and have the worst a flavor ever this has always been my favorite dish and I always order it...
as a main dish I ordered the barbecue beef sandwich .....the bread was hard ,as a rock the cheese wasn't melted and the beef was overcooked and crunchy this was terrible food at this restaurant this time I won't be back.   
this BJ Brewhouse was the most disappointing I have ever been to.Usually Pei Wei would be up there in stars and its why I gave this one 2 instead on 0!  Worst location!  They messed up my carryout after telling the guy on the phone 3 TIMES no red pepper, usually never a problem but i had that feeling he wasn't listening, you guessed it i got red pepper!  This was of course with my COLD hot n sour soup and after my longer then usual bad service wait.  Stay away from thsi location.  i was so upset i sent an email and no response, no sorry, nothing.  LAMEThe food is pretty good, but the service not so much. I placed a takeout order online, arrived to pick it up as scheduled, paid for it, and stood there waiting 10 minutes with 4 or 5 other people - while the people behind the counter didn't even bother to look for my order, which (as it turns out) was sitting right there on the shelf in plain sight. Wtf?So sad closed. Oh well.I've frequented Teakwoods for the past 10 years. And this place has changed for the worse. It used to be a trendy ski-lodge Wisconsin-Colorado bar with cute and friendly waitresses. The crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before venturing out to Scottsdale or Tempe.  

Now, it almost feels like a glorified Applebees.  The crowd has gotten older. You see a lot of good ole boys and meatheads eat here. The waitresses transformed from being fun and cute girls that you would see in a trendy Tempe bar to homely girls who don't smile and seem to hate their life.  Whatever was fun and charming about this place has been lost.  Don't worry, Teakwoods will always be busy because the Applebees crowd is going to continue to flock to this place because the food and prices are excellent. However, the service and vibe has taken a major hit. I would recommend Zipps or Payton's place before Teakwoods.

In terms of watching sports, this isn't a great place. Not all of the TV's are flat screens and nearly all the TV's in that side room have old school TV's with bad reception.  They also don't have common sense in regards to programming. For example, they had the nerve to have soccer playing on several of the TV's during March Madness.I got the Jack Not Jill sandwich.  Maybe it was my fault for changing the hamburger bun out to wheat toast but, this sandwich was very lackluster.  The fries were soggy and not crisp at all.  I won't be rushing back and, if I did go back I would definitely order something different.I really used to like this place but when the management changed, so did everything else. I remember when for lunch there would be a line to the door, now I never see anyone in there. I might go here 1 or 2 times a year, nothing really that great about it anymore, right when I step in the place seems kind of dirty and isn't very welcoming. If they made some changes..this place could be decent again.Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.I should have followed my instincts and avoided this location for the more calm location on Gilbert & Germann.  We showed up for a late Sat night showing.. walked in to a really packed theater and luckily were able to find seating in the upper section (or un-luckily as you'll see).  Because it was so packed, I got stuck sitting next to Joe Dirt and his trailer-park girlfriend.. who wouldn't stop talking through the movie and making out the whole time... DISgusTING.  Yuk... nothing like watching the Hunger Games to wet kissing and trailer-park PDA right next to you. Ufff

The rest of the atmosphere was OK, but this place is so busy (even on a late night showing) that I now know better and will avoid it if I want to a) park easily and b) not wait in line for tickets and c) not deal with such a crowded theater.I went to Crabby Don's before AZ went smoke-free and it was miserable. So the only reason  I'm giving this crap hole two stars is based on the highly unlikely possibility that now that none of the metalheads in there can blow smoke in my face, that it might be a little more cool.  But its doubtful.

Ah metalheads...not my kind of person.  Sorry.  Not my kind of music either.  So freaking loud you cant hear your friends literally screaming in your ear over the screaming metalheads.  Annoying.  Bathrooms were filthy and there was a girl snorting coke off the sink.  Have some tact metalheads.  

This place sucked, even for Gilbert.This place is very small and gets crowded very quickly. It is a frustrating experience every time I go in there. People are standing around since there is little seating and the line goes right into the dining area. Too small! They are also pretty slow at getting the food out to the customers which is surprising since it's just a bagel shop. Their coffee is terrible, too.

The actual food is good. I get the Lox and haven't been disappointed, I just hate going in there to get it.nice place, spacious, good decor. Attentive, considerate waitperson. Attractive menu - lots of choices. Complimentary chips (really good) with salsa - all of which are hot - good but spicy. Just FYI. The prices were ok, a bit high - lunch for 2 with one beer, one appetizer, tax & tip = the high side of the $40 range. There was a lot of food, enough for 3-4 more average size meals. We had the shrimp chimi app - ok although I wondered afterwards why - I should have known it would be tiny (probably canned) shrimp. Nice to find on a menu though. MH had the carne asada chimi - flavorful and large. It was ok. As for me, I really didn't like my meal size (ok, who am I kidding - it was HUGE) chicken chimichanga. I'm not an expert of Mexican food by any means but I've had this dish before. There's got to be more to it than putting bite size (not really shredded) white chicken inside - really, that's all there was, no cheese, sour cream, salsa mixed with it - it was incredibly dry. If these are your favorite, ask about this first, imo. Maybe it was just the way I got it, but I wasn't impressed. It left me with a lot of retro-prep work on the leftovers. I might go back, but I doubt it ...I... don't get it. I don't get the high rating on this restaurant. Sorry, guys. 

When we arrived, the parking lot was packed, but once inside we were seated almost immediately out on the patio. Unfortunately, we were not seated with menus. Our server visited our table twice before correcting this error. One of our salsa bowls arrived at our table with caked on food bits. After ordering our food, we waited almost an hour for our entrees... which were sincerely lacking in yum.

I ordered the Faja Pasta - so maybe it's partially my own fault for order a pasta dish at a Mexican restaurant - but it was not very good. The pasta was very doughy, and many of the noodles were clumped together. The bread it came with, while not awful, was partially soggy from sitting on the plate too long. Saving grace was the chicken I had with it. It was juicy and had a nice kick. One star for the chicken.

Fiance ordered a seafood enchilada which he found lacking in seafood and smothered in too much cheese. 

We ate until we were full enough to call it a meal. As unsatisfying as it was. 

Second star is for our server, because even though he was a smidge on the slow side, he was trying, bless his heart. He refilled my soda before it was completely empty, so that's a plus for me. 

I don't think we'll be returning.Let me first start by stating that I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian (meaning I eat eggs and milk products) but no meat or meat products (such as chicken broth, lard etc...) so my two-star rating is informed by that. I usually am successful at finding great food at mexican restaurants since many have transitioned away from using lard in much of there food and provide some fresh, vegetable based options. Not so much at Nando's. After informing our waiter of our vegetarian status, he wasn't sure what was vegetarian or not. After asking the cook staff, we found out that there is lard in the enchilada sauce (UGH!) and beans. We ended up ordering some cheese enchiladas with salsa instead of the regular sauce. 

In terms of what we ate, it was okay. If you like lots of cheese and eat meat, you may love this place! It's your basic mexican restaurant fare (lots of meat, beans and rice) :) Also, the atmosphere was nice (adorable patio) and would consider going back for margaritas. But in terms of food, I'll keep looking for a mexican restaurant with some healthier, vegetarian friendly options and a staff who is confident in what they are offering.We went there for the lunch special.  I had broccoli chicken and my mom had vegetarian.  Both were drowned in a salty sauce.  I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  Otherwise, the food was ok.   Mine came in a smallish bowel.  If you don't want to get full at lunch time, it's perfect.

Service was very friendly and fast.  Prices were ok for the amount served.  It's pretty quiet in there, so people can hear your conversation if anyone pays attention at all.OK...this has nothing to do with this U Haul location, but has everything to do with the policies they carry.  I rent a truck, state to state 1 way, truck is great.  They price matched budget truck and even got me some other freebies (blankets, dolly).  BUT...when you pick the truck up it was on 1/4 tank of gas.  They say bring back with at least a 1/4.  How am i supposed to know how gas I'm going to use?  How do I leave the truck with 1/4 tank of gas?  Get gas every 100 miles and not fill up?  When you have a policy like this the only person who wins in UHaul.  Rent a car, bring back full, why cant UHaul understand this.  Full is full, and its really easy to do.  "Sir/Mis, remember bring the truck back full or its $5 a gallon."  No problem, but to bring back at 1/4 tank, and if its over that, thanks!!!!!!  Bad policy by UHaul.  BTW, this site, easy to find and the guy who checked me out, did that, checked me out.  Once again this is about UHaul and the shitty policy they have!Such a disappointment! I ordered my Fav-a carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream & bacon. I know crazy!! I paid $9 for a burrito! Usually it's not that much at the other locations. So when I opened the bag of disappointment & saw the smallest burrito ever, well that left me sad. But the party just began cuz the taste of the ingredients topped off the dismal feeling put forth by this location makes me sad to say this location blowsWhat can I say but "Meh".
 
A friend and I shared the special omelet of the day which had jalapenos, corn, black beans, avocado, green chile, bacon and cheese in it.  It was huge and more than enough to share.  But it wasn't particularly tasty.  The bacon was overcooked and greasy, and I actually like my bacon very well done!  The jalapenos either weren't in it or had no taste and the green chile was bland. That baby should have had a huge scoop of fresh pico de gallo to accompany it to give it some flavor! The breakfast potatoes were almost burnt and tasted like they had been cooked in old grease that remained behind to coat them!  The wheat toast was actually a soft long wheat roll, cut in half and toasted -- not tasty at all and I don't want "soft" toast!  The coffee was good and the service was attentive.  Based on the quality of that meal, I wouldn't go back .. I'd eat next door at Liberty Market instead!Breakfast chow was okay, but the friendly service was tarnished by 1) no menu 2) failure to meet my order and 3) no effort to ask, "How's your breakfast?"

PROS: they had egg whites instead of Egg Beaters, which was better than having to do regular eggs; turkey sausage was also available, but the flavor was meh; hash browns were very good--crispy outside, soft inside; neat establishment in Old Town Gilbert, w/ high ceilings, wood floors, etc. Staff were friendly, but . . .  

CONS:  received a cheerful, "Sit wherever you want!", then waited for a menu. Five minutes passed, and I was offered a beverage. When the drink was delivered, I was asked for my order. Ummm . . . I waived off the menu and placed an ala carte request.  I also asked if they had salsa. The response was a cheerful, "Yes and it's homemade! It's good!"  My plate arrived -- I never saw any salsa . . . nor my waitress for that matter, until it was time to deliver the bill (albeit with a cheerful demeanor, which I did appreciate). My last rant? The 70s music piped into the dining area. I hate Chicago--always have. The follow-on dose of Boston and The Spinners did not improve the ambiance for me . . . The silver lining? The theme from "Shaft" came on as I was about to leave! "He's one bad mutha f-- . . . Shut yo mouth! . . . I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft! . . . We can dig it!" I stayed and listened. Then made a hasty exit as the radio segued to Kansas. YUCK!

The Farmhouse is a neat looking place, and the chow is satisfactory, but my service was lacking.  Lastly, the tunes were like fingernails on a chalboard to me (w/ one notable exception).  I think I'll try another establishment next time I am in town.

Cheers!
RSWent to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.

My biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list.Visited on Friday.  Ordered the Match with Hatch burger with jalapeno & cheddar potato pie on the side.  Presentation was good.  The burger was disappointing to be honest -- green chile was minimal (and not flavorful) and served luke warm.  The picture on the website and menu looks oh so much better.  The potato pie was good and had a bit of pizzazz to it that the burger lacked and was served hot.  Customer service was good and lots of "regular customers" were about ordering.  I won't be back but given the regular clientele within, it probably satisfies many peoples tastes.Peach Festival 2012: Do not expect big plump peaches. The variety grown at this farm are small desert peaches. As of mid-May 2012, the majority of peaches were not yet tree ripened. If you hand pick, take time to search the orchard and find a tree with good fruit.

Footwear recommendation... if you do the UPICK, wear something you don't care gets dirty... the peach orchard ground is unlevel dirt and patches of mud, so wearing nice footwear or flip flops is not recommended.

The peach pancake breakfast served on-site was generous with the pancakes, but stingy on the peach topping. The peaches used in the topping were unripe, somewhat crunchy, and required a sprinkling of sugar. Expect to stand in a long slow line for your serving.

Free admission and parking, but higher prices for many of the peach related products and other items sold at this festival.Don't get me wrong, it's a cute place for families and kids but the parking was a bit unorganized and the prices were a little steep for entrance and all the extras inside. We went for the Pumpkin & Chili party and I couldn't believe what they were charging for the food. I will say that I had a nice evening with the friends I went with even though we seriously almost got lost in the corn maze! It wouldn't hurt to try this place for another event to update my review... until then it gets a 2.5 stars from me!When I walked in the gentleman told me to pick any chair. So I did then he asked me to move. I waited about 10 mins until someone came over. She was very sweet and very old. Not that there is anything wrong with that however she was not taking her time like the others. She finished my Pedi in 30 mins. The calus remover was an additional $5 which I usually don't mind paying however she maybe scrubbed my feet maybe 5 times. I also asked for the sugar scrub which was oil and sugar scrub. Again not worth it. The foot massage lasted 5 minutes. So after paying $40 I would have much rather have gone to pink polish!!!!Fun audio snippets overheard from other customers: "private equity," "When is YOUR next cruise?" and "What do you plan to do in Israel?"  So that gives an idea of the clientele. A nice place to relax.

Okay, the food:  I'm on a mission to find the best pastrami-on-rye  in the Valley.  The pastrami meat here is the best I've tasted.  Clean, flavorful, not salty.  And they pile on just the right amount.  

But -- ACK! -- here's the worst thing possible: The sandwich arrived with MAYONNAISE.  Really, I'm not kidding.  (I ordered the sandwich -- specifically -- with lettuce, tomato, onions and mustard.)  This is beyond "faux pas" for a Jewish deli, so I have go lower than the "A-OK" yelp defines for three stars and go with two.

Otherwise: The pickle was excellent and fresh and did not taste like salt, just good.  The bread the fell apart, a bit too dry and not a lot of "rye" flavor.  The red onion slices were about 1/4" inch thick, at least twice as thick as I prefer.Pros:
- Good, quality work for a somewhat reasonable price

Cons:
- Lots of efforts to "up sell".  In other words, they'll try to offer all sorts of breaks to get you to buy a more expensive service.
- Sell services without being completely open.  For example, I was sold a detail deal without being informed that the detail must be scheduled.  Also, I was told to give them a call and they'll get me scheduled next week.  I contacted them within a week and they said it was 4-5 weeks before they could get me scheduled.

Be wary and ask LOTS of questions before paying for some services.Horrible customer service.  I just watched the man in front of me get treated like crap over a $1 additional charge.  The cashier was dismissive and flat out rude.  I won't be coming back here and neither will that man.  She just lost this business 2 customers over $1 and her bad attitude.   The quality of the wash was decent hence the 2 stars.A special night, one anniversary one birthday and a very disappointing evening.which was marred but very mediocre food and an overbearing waitress.

To sit and visit while enjoying your drinks was interrupted by a waitress trying to get an order while half the restaurant was empty. The food -salads OK, entrees - shrimp was dry and tasteless, scallops small plate was not inspiring, beef kabob was not good either, but my filet was very nice.

Having had good meals in the past and to go to an upscale top restaurant and receive this annoying service and less than stellar food is very disturbing and I would think it will be a long time before we return.

I was embarrassed in choosing this restaurant and felt bad that our friends had to pay so much for so little on a Thursday night.I am sad to say we did not have a very good experience this time. My husband and I are big advocates for Flemings but we are not so sure any more. 
We visited this time to celebrate our Valentines (a little late but our job schedules don't always allow us to celebrate on the exact dates), I had made a reservation earlier in the day for 6:30 for their "Arizona room" since their dining room was booked. They assured me that it was heated with heaters and a fire but ill get to that... We arrived around 6:10 and let the host staff know we were there.. They already seemed pretty flustered and it was only 6pm.. We waited till about 6:35 ish till we were seated where the fans were all on, ppl at other tables were wearing their heavy coats, none of the heaters were on and the fire really didn't seem to help at all and I shivered the whole time only after asking our waitress if the fans could be turned off.  We waited for our server to come for about 15 min and than waited another 15 min for our drink orders...
We finally got to order and waited at least 45 min to an hour before receiving our food. My husband ordered his fav, the filet and a baked potato (medium), however, what came out was almost done with no pink at all in the center and I ordered the pork chop with the mushrooms, it was just okay... Not better than what I could make on my grill at home! 
The server finally came back to check on us and when my husband replied that his steak was just okay she must have mentioned it to the manager. He walked over, asked how our meal was and gave us a coupon for $25 off to use Feb18-March 28th...as well as removed the steak from our bill... We were glad they did something but sad that we were so excited to go to one of our fav more upscale restaurants only to be pretty disappointed. 
We weren't sure if it is under new management or new ownership all together but I hope something happens fast or else most people will start to go to the other locations.Recently moved to AZ from Chicago and found this place nearby.  Their attempt at Chicago hot dogs was pretty feeble at best... the dog was soggy (doubting that it was authentic Vienna Beef), they used the wrong pickles... the fries were hard and I couldn't finish them.  The pizza that the guys at the next table over were eating looked pretty sad.  And they're from Chicago and don't make Chicago deep dish pizza?  C'mon...

Dead silent in this place, one tv that was positioned so that nobody could see it, no soda fountain.... I had high hopes, but this place missed the mark.  For good Chicago hot dogs and better ambiance, I'll go to Taste of Chicago on Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird.I went to Lowe's in search of a garbage can with wheels. My sister and I entered through the plant department. As we entered there was a large rack of small plants that were 50% off the listed price. It was a handwritten sign, the message was easy to understand and very clear. I didn't see any other pricing on the plants that made this misleading. As we walked through I saw a cashier running around watering some plants. We began the search for the elusive can. In the past, I had seen employees wearing company vests in various areas of the store. I'm pretty sure I walked a secret path where all employees were invisible. While staring up at the signs I finally catch a glimpse of an employee behind a lighting desk. I say hello and explain what I'm searching for. There was no smile, no greeting, no friendly tone of voice, I felt as though I was an inconvenience to this individual. We follow the directions and find the can. We decide to pay and exit through the plant department. On the way we see another rack of various sized plants and flowers. This rack had a printed "50% off" sign. We saw the original pricing tags in white and other tags in yellow.  In some cases the yellow tag was not 50% off the white tag. The sign didn't say 50% lowest price or price marked is 50% off. We banter back and forth between ourselves trying to make sense of it all. It would have been simple to ask a CSR...but there were none to be found! We arrive in checkout and the CSR is friendly, outgoing and helpful!! We donate to their current promotion, (sign the shamrock- they hang it and it will help some organization). I normally shop at Home Depot and will continue to after I have spent the remaining money on my GC. This was a great opportunity for Lowe's to WoW me away from HD. It could happen on my next visit, afterall we eventually found an employee that did their job beautifully. Anything is possible! Good Luck Lowes on the next go-a-round.We got our lunch togo and to pickup since we're staying at a nearby hotel. 

We ordered the Pork Cutlet and Tempura which were both suppose to come with soup, salad, and rice. Both our orders got salad, but only one rice and no soup at all. The dressing for the salad was bitter and weird. Even the salad pieces were bitter. 

The Pork Cutlet was okay, but it was on the dry side. And the tonkatsu sauce wasn't that good. I'm not sure if they make it themselves, or they buy it. The tempura batter was a little thick and not that great. Making pork cutlet and tempura isn't that hard, I don't know how they went wrong with that.

Maybe they're only known for their sushi. We haven't tried it yet, but we probably won't anyways.Sakana is another typical sushi place. I wasn't blown away, nor do I feel that the quality of fish justified the expense. 

It's a small place and we requested the first available seats; after 10 minutes we were seated at the Sushi Bar. Our chairs backed up to the kitchen entrance, which was literally two feet away.  I distinctly remember watching a basketball game during this meal, since the TVs are right in front of your face at the sushi bar. 

It took forever just to get water. By the time we ordered happy hour was over and we had to pay full price. We put the order in and each roll came out at least five minutes a part. The fish was not really fresh--it looked like it had been sitting in the cooler for too long. After we had been finished for 15 minutes another roll they'd forgotten about came out. We were full. The sushi chef let us know: "No worries, someone else will order it soon", as he placed it on top of the cooler to sit....and sit...

I usually go into detail about each item I order, but it was so nondescript I practically forgot what we had by the time we got to the car.Houston's is good but definitely not the caliber that they used to be.  The service was sub-par, the food was good this time but has been hit and miss the past couple of times.  They are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  Also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - SERIOUSLY?! (the waitress knew as she said "oops, I forgot the candle")  Between that and charging $3 PER soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.  

The food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  You can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at J Alexanders.  Houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it.I used to LOVE this restaurant, but after some recent experiences, I plan to take my business elsewhere.

Their service remains excellent, but food quality has seriously soured.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.

The fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.

I would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.  I have other restaurants that are tastier.This is a good place for a quick meal. We've eaten breakfast here a few times. The food is always decent, the service always prompt. 
Here's the thing - I always feel RUSHED, totally rushed. 
I'm not the type of person that nurses a drink,  takes up a table for hours or sips coffee all morning. I don't even read the paper while I'm there, although I might like to if I didn't feel so rushed.

This morning I noticed a sign that says "During our busy times, please do not conduct your business meetings, studying.." I can't remember the rest but I found it offensive.

I can understand that they don't want people taking up a table when paying customers are waiting. I totally get that. 
However, the place is huge and I've never waited for a table. 

Perhaps if the wording was different. If people are hanging out, aren't they spending money? Even if they're drinking coffee? 
Maybe the patio could be self service so waiters don't have to miss out on customers. 

It totally rubbed me the wrong way and it's plastered as soon as you walk in the door. It's like saying "Don't enjoy your time here, get in and get out!"
In this economy you think they'd be happy to have any business.A Dear John letter to Randy's.

Oh how I once loved you. Okay, maybe love is the wrong word, but I counted on you for consistency. For good breakfasts, decent prices and fast, fast service.

But Randy's, you've broken my heart. Not with the hair I found in my steak and eggs last Saturday but with your heartless, corporate policies. Randy's, remember the days when you were independent and cared about your reputation? Remember when the customer was usually right and when things went wrong that meant making it right?

Yes, I found a hair in my food. But I'm no prude. I realize that can happen anywhere. And does. But your refusal to do anything but replace the food sans hair is forcing me to leave you. Forever. Yes, I talked my feelings through with the waitress, then the manager, and then Randy himself. But my head shouldn't have to spin off my shoulders to get a $8 refunded to me and a meal replaced for the inconvenience of a hair in my food.

So I bid you a fond farewell, Randy's. I've had good meals and so-so meals in your humble restaurant, but I have to draw the line. And I'm drawing it at poor management. Love 'em or leave 'em the saying goes. And I'll be sure not to the let the door hit me in the bum on the way out.

Love, me.I have hesitated before to give not so great reviews to places, especially when they seem to be a valley institution and they are family run, however the whole reason we use Yelp is to help us make decisions on where we want to spend our hard earned money.  When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes:
Even though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago.
Taco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh.
Basically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review.
Oh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.  The ATM in the front charges a fee, I wonder who gets to pocket that fee?Wow not impressed wit the mens clothing prices. There a whole bunch of higher end store with this price range. The store crew was amazing and helpful! Really nice people.I was excited to go here because of all of the great things I have heard about Lamar...but I was disappointed :(  It all started with a pushy tour of the place and I wasn't impressed because it felt a bit dirty and old.  Then the next scary thing was a very crooked eyebrow wax that looked really strange...followed by an even worse massage.  I would be willing to try it again because so many people love this place but I just haven't been brave enough!The actual hotel is pretty nice.  It is clean, comfortable, nice pool and nice workout room.  The location is good as well.  

My complaint is about the customer service.  They promised us a full refund if we canceled rooms.  We had to cancel some rooms because we had a big group and less people came then expected one of the nights.  They didn't tell us we needed to do a 3 night minimum so we were stuck paying a much more expensive rate for the two nights we stayed there.  They wouldn't do anything about it.  They also didn't have my room available until 4:30.  The staff was very unhelpful altogether.I stayed here a couple weeks ago for business and although the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and all I wasn't impressed with the hotel. I assumed it would be a nice resort hotel since it was in Scottsdale, AZ (resort capital right??) but it was not. It's pretty outdated. My bed was comfy but the hotel itself needs an overhaul. The walls are VERY thin. I heard the neighbors coming home, talking, breathing, etc. The TV was an old tube style TV! Come on even Holiday Inns now have LCD's lol. Sorry I judge hotels by TVs :)

I ate at the hotel restaurants and was not pleased. The food is lackluster at best without much variety nor flavor. And that's including the breakfast buffet! I live for my breakfasts when I travel so not meeting my standards in servicing such a simple but best meal of the day is disappointing. I know hotel food is never the greatest but I've had delicious meals at many hotels. 

The highlight was definitely eating at Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, which is connected to the hotel. Absolutely the best salmon!! I loved it so much that it deserved to have its very own review written lol.I'm typically a Marriott girl, so staying at a Hilton was a stretch! I must say, even though the price was better here, I would still pay more for a Marriott property. The front desk receptionist didn't even know how to get back to the Villas, where we were staying. The Villa itself is nice, but that's about where it ends. Food at the restaurant is good; there is better elsewhere in Scottsdale. It is conveniently located though; and you can walk to The Good Egg in the strip mall adjacent. (Also - try Humble Pie!). The friendliest people there were the concierge (great golf recommendations) and the night person at the desk, who gladly split our bill between two couples. I wouldn't stay here again, unless it was another great deal.Room was small, not much better than  a Holiday Inn Express.  Air conditioner didn't work in our room, they brought us a fan (we moved to a new room the next day).  Staff very unfriendly.  Bathroom very small.  Pool area very plain.  Good location.  Would not stay there again.Low on staff, with prices that can't compete with a larger Fry's or Albertsons. I wouldn't go at all, but it's easily the closest grocery store to me. Don't look for a shopping experience here, just get in, and get out and try not to inconvenience any of the staff by asking where something is located.I'm not sure if I caught this place on and off night or the people that are rating it so high have a lower standard for service and food quality than I have.

The décor, as a lot of folks have described, is incredibly outdated.  I'm not one to really comment on décor, but this was really something out of "That 70's Show".  The TV's were great(that's where they get the two stars from).

Service?  What service?  I sat down at a table in the bar area and waited for almost 10 minutes for the server to ask if I needed anything.  There were two other tables with guests at the time, so I couldn't understand why it took so long.  

After I ordered my glass of wine, I reviewed the menu.  Decided to start simple with the chips and salsa.  I was long finished with my glass of wine and looked around to locate her.  She was at her terminal reading and sending text messages on her phone.  I was able to catch her attention and waved her over and placed my order.  

About 10-15 minutes later, chips and salsa came out.  Half of the chips were stuck together and under done.  The salsa was made up of mostly seeds.  Literally, seeds.

For dinner, I ordered a 1/2 slab of the baby back ribs.  HORRIBLE!!  Mostly fat.  Almost no meat.  They do get some props for the fries, though.

When it came time for the check, once again, server had disappeared.   Two or three more tables came in, so my urgency to get settled up ramped up.  Since I couldn't get any attention when there were only two other tables besides me, I didn't want to hang around when there were four or five.  I turned around, once again, to see the server texting on her cell phone.

I don't get to Scottsdale often, but if I do come back, I won't be returning to this place.  Lot's better in the area.Have always had good service in the past but today was not good at all.
Went in for a simple air check and rotation on tires I had bought a year ago.  They took my keys to check the milage and as soon as he came back in he began telling me I needed 2 new front tires and they were completely unsafe. Continued to tell me it was mechanical and not covered by my warranty when I asked. 
Very high pressured and odd when he began pushing me to go to an auto shop down the street for repairs he knew about.  
Did not give me options on tires, simply said it would be $476. 
I found better tires at wal-mart for $100 less out the door and no pressure!Prices are way high for a breakfast place. Over 25 dollars for two adults. Cute atmosphere, but the food, which sounded unique and delicious on the menu, did not live up to the talk. Super disappointed.This establishment is walking distance from my home, my husband and I are also very committed to supporting the local economy, and therefore we wanted to purchase our bike from a bike shop as opposed to a chain store- even though her bikes cost on average $75-100 more for the same brand (Sports Authority at TMP has the same brand of Electra bikes for less, for example).

The owner Crystal was very kind and helpful in the research process, and let us ride the different bikes out back. The beach cruisers hurt my knees and so she directed us to a "Giant" brand bike where the pedals were a little farther back. I was still unsure and she recommended I try riding it longer to see. So I purchased the bike and a basket, and took it home and rode it around a little bit. The basket clinks against the bike rod (it doesn't fit correctly with the shape of the bike), and the bike still hurts my knees so we went back two days later to see about a trade-in or return, and she told us all sales were final. 

I expressed to her that it is bad business to have an "all sales final" without putting up signage, and also without even telling the customer at the time of purchase. I find this to be manipulative and dishonest. I did notice that the receipt she gave me after purchase did say "all sales final" on the top, however I did not get this until AFTER the purchase. 

So now I am stuck with a bike that hurts my knees, cost $375, plus a $35 basket that does not fit. In the future unfortunately, because of this unsavory experience, I will be purchasing all future bikes from mega retailers.It is another strip mall - and a very subpar one at that.  No covered parking.  No real stores of interest.  Too crowded, and a royal pain in the ass to take a left turn out of given the light timing.We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special "only if you pay extra" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.
It was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice.= = = = =  DAILY LUNCH & DINNER BUFFET  = = = = =

Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Mike C.  Although the dining room is ok and the salads good, the taste of the food is all downhill after that.  They are now up to serving eight soups, but the taste of them as well as pretty much everything else here was just BLAH today.  The Chicken Enchilada and Albondigas Soups, for example, could have been great, but instead were just NOTHING!  Who's the chef for this outfit?

They've switched from blah frozen yogurt for dessert to soft serve ice cream, which could have been good, but instead it was blah low calorie stuff, no better than what they had before.  

I actually had a pretty good lunch at their Ahwatukee location not long ago but this one was such a dud today that I'm afraid It's the end of the road for me & Sweet Tomatoes.  LIfe's too short.     :-O

Daily Lunch & Dinner Buffet:  $8.99/$8.09 Sr. (Rev. 11/26/13)The food was delicious as usual, however the service was not good.  A piece of advice to the rude person running the cash register, when a customer asks about pricing for a kid's meal answer their question and actually act like you care and want to provide good service.  Apparently finding out what kind of drinks we wanted, getting us rung up, and moved along was more important.  There was a small line behind me, but those customers can wait just as I had to wait for those who were in front of me.  Sorry my patronage was such an inconvenience on the boy (definitely not a man)  running the register.  

Too many other good places to go with much better service.I went here on a Saturday evening for a wine tasting benefit organized by a friend.  The all white decor was a little much.  A wanna be Vegas or Miami look.  There was also a unique crowd.  Lots of older couples who were trying too hard to prove they were still young and hip.Venerable Chef Hiromasa Kyodasan and crew's recent arrival heralds an upcoming rocket to higher food standards. After just 4 weeks, his discerning approach is already evident, but he has his work cut out for him.

--controlling hostess is stickler for seating rules; _throw down_ to avoid a 30 min wait, or just ask for the manager
--Kyodasan brought with him two chefs, one kitchen, one teppan. great things to come!
--he's already fixed wasabi (no more tubes),
--gari is fresh and tart (not from a jar one month opened) and
--seaweed wraps are dry and crispy, rolls made fresh, not in advance
--fish selection (corporate "sashimi grade" blech), and tempura batter will change up first of the year.
--great family place, main dining is loud and boisterous
--benihana "experience" feels forced and scripted
--watch out for upsell-freak waiters at your teppan table
--one lunch server is power smoker, taking 3 minute breaks _during service_, then thinking we wouldn't smell his breath. EW.

in the end it's all about the food, and the food is...
--bland, gooey, overcooked, or undercooked.
--teppan fried rice's egg is _always_ burned. how about adding it at the last moment, not starting it first??
--side salad is often not fresh
--miso is colored water, no substance or rich flavor I'm expecting
--ginger and mustard sauces are the same for every main dish

Chef recalls that the last time I visited him at his Shiro (now sadly closed) the county inspector was in the kitchen. What are the odds that on the day I discover his arrival at Benihana, she shows up again?! They'll think I'm some sort of spy. Of course, she arrived right amidst the lunch rush!

I hope my update will mark a dramatic improvement over the next weeks and months.

GO HIRO!I'm a little surprised on all the very positive reviews for Gyro's Express. I would give it about a 2.5 based on the quality of food, portion size, & cost. I ordered the greek salad with falafal ($10) and my boyfriend ordered a gyro lunch special ($10). The falafal balls were simply not good. They were dry & dense and lacked the crispy on the outside/soft on the inside freshness of good falafal balls. The salad itself was really small - I expect a larger portion size for a $10 salad. I will say the feta on top of the salad was quite good but there were only 3 small slices. My boyfriend thought his gyro was average and that the greek place down the street (taste of greek) made a better one. The french fries were good, but that is not so hard to do. All the seating is indoors which really is a shame in a place with good weather. Overall, I wouldn't come back here to eat again because there are lots of other choices nearby.This is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.I thought this place was alright. If someone wanted to check it out I would go back but I wouldn't recommend it when picking a place to eat.  The menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non-sushi eating person in the group this place would not work.  
We went here on a sunday afternoon at noonish and stayed for quite awhile....no one else came in while we were there.  This sort of freaked me out.  Anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine. Nothing amazing but not bad at all.  The one thing I did not like was the spicy tuna roll was pretty big.  I can't stand that. Anyway, its ok. Check it out and decide for yourself.I think this pie is awful. I have had it twice and all I got was a 16" grease pie cut into annoying little squares. When I requested the pie to be cut into a traditional round style, my request was met with a huff and a puff. It's quite pricy too.This was just so not worth it. The pizza was tasteless, overpriced and burnt. So I guess if it had any taste it would be burnt crust taste. We had the margherita and pepperoni pizza, and they skimped on the sauce for both so that there was way too much end crust that tasted...burnt. Very disappointed.I was so excited to go get my cheesecake factory fix for the year and then I remembered why I only go once every 14 months, if that.  :( server was super awkward and not very personable...but I really liked their small plates menu, great way to try a few things, keep on budget and not stuff your face before it's time for a piece of their cheesecake.I usually am pleased by The Cheesecake Factory but this time I will say it was a horrible experience. First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful.

The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.

Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory.Well, we went here on a Monday night to celebrate a birthday.  We made a reservation for 730pm and waited until 8pm to be seated, they kept telling us they did not have any seats for a party of 5 - their reasoning for the long wait.  They were also under staffed and did not have enough cooks on this day which added to the longer than average wait time for food.  Whitney, our waitress was very helpful and accommodating.  

We waited over 30 minutes for our food and by the time we ordered the food, the place was half empty so no real reason why it would take so long except to say the manager should have called in more help, but didn't.

The Kale and Quinoa app salad is bigger than small like the waitress said and can be a full meal in itself.  I had to send it back because they first brought it out without any Quinoa and grapes, when I got it back the 2nd time it was loaded with flavor, grapes and Quinoa plus the buttermilk dressing was excellent with it.   Also the incredible egg plant sandwich on brown bread was a hit and actually it was much better eaten alone instead of with the bread.  The Chinese chicken salad was just okay nothing to rave about as was the rest of the food - just ok - fettuccine, market burger, lettuce wraps, just ok nothing wow..  The cheesecakes again were just ok nothing to rave about - the banana cream needed more banana flavor and more cream, the mango key lime needed to be a bit more tart and the guey yellow stuff on top of the mango key lime is terrible and should be taken off.  the only cheesecake which was good was the original.  This place is hit and miss - sometimes everything is amazing and other times well just ok....It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns.I only go to Ulta when I have to, and always leave mad.  Yes, they're the only place close by that has the better cosmetic brands.  And you don't have the hassle of a big mall.  And the floor staff does sincerely want to help you.  

However, the merchandise is laid out so haphazardly I hardly ever can find what I came in for.  And neither can the salesperson who inevitably gets enlisted to help me.  So the salesperson tries to steer me toward an alternate product that's nothing like what I asked for because she really isn't all that knowledgeable about the products.  The one time I took their salesperson's advice I sorely regretted it, so I usually just end up shooing them off after a while.  

Then there's checkout.  Awwwww jeez.  Wait in line forever listening to the inane chatter going on ahead of me.  Then the, "do you have your Ulta card, I can look it up for you, would you like one, where should we send your free magazines".  Hey lady, I just want to buy some make up, not join a country club.  Just ring me up and get me out of this madhouse.I don't know why I keep coming to this, I always think "this time it will be different", but it never is. 

They are extremely overpriced and the smell of perfuming is like a brick upside your head. I only use Dermalogica products so the 20% off coupon is useless for me and I can buy OPI & Essie nail polishes at Target. I think I've finally learned my lesson and will stop expecting more from this establishment.I should really write two reviews. I received a tattoo from Tami who is phenomenal. The problem is the other tattoo I received from the gentleman who's name I sadly can't remember. Him penciling me in at the end of his day as a walk in should have been a red flag. All I received was the Watchmen smiley on my inner arm. Well - something resembling it. Maybe I'm crazy but I don't remember circles having straight edges. He couldn't even manage to get the bloodstain correct. To top it all off the whole thing is a scar from him carelessly carving into my arm. Tami is good but she should find a new home, I couldn't go to a place that trusts such horrible artists.I have used this dry cleaner a couple of times before and was happy with my service but the last time I went I took a skirt and they absolutely ruined it, it was a J Crew skirt and had gold stripes. I specifically asked if they could get it cleaned without ruining it because it wasn't cheap and they assured me that they could. I understand things happen but it has been 2 weeks and I haven't heard a word from the owner that was supposed to call me and refund my money. I would not recommend based upon poor customer service and lack of care.I've been to Farrelli's a handful of times now. I've come to conclude that the concept is fanciful, but the execution is mediocre. 

5 Pros: 
-the art deco doors, gorgeous! 
-Hollywood glam posters on the wall 
-you push a button on your coaster, it lights up, then over pops the waiter with your refill 
-you can have a drink at the lounge while you wait for your film 
-there's an email listserv and you can get hooked up with deals 

5 Cons: 
-the food isn't great, (IT'S AWFUL) tastes mass produced and bland 
-too expensive 
-slow service in the theater, rude service upfront 
-you get graced with "smoooooth jazz" before the film starts, yeah no really. 
-if you're not on a date here, you'll feel like you should beI love restoration hardware's lines, they have the coolest industrial and reclaimed furniture and lighting out there.  I could probably furnish at least 50% of the items in all of my houses from restoration hardware alone if it wasn't for the fact that sadly the store is operated horribly.  It's not even a store  it's a showroom so you can custom order things that should be in stock but aren't everything needs to be orderred from overseas and takes forever!!!  it's not unusual to wait 3-6 months for lighting fixtures i mean why even have a store if you stock almost nothing.  Go to a web catalog and make sure your customers are ready for the disappointment and a long wait.    Furniture is a little better but not much and quality is a question because if you have a problem there support is usually weak.  

This is truly sad because Restoration Hardware matches my taste exactly sadly they can't match my expectations for a quality furniture store even remotely.  So I typically just drool over there beautiful products and the best catalogs out there today. then look for alternate sourcing that can actually deliver.This Restoration Hardware embodies pretty much everything that I dislike about the stereotypical Scottsdale business. It oozes pretension (What furniture store needs their own valet parking, especially when the parking garage is literally right across the street from it?), with salespeople that won't give you the time of day if they don't consider you worthy of shopping there. I passed by at least 3 salespeople who walked by, ignoring me.

I walked in and looked at all the furniture. Every single piece had the same drab, linen-pale-beige, burlap-sack colored fabric on it. From the looks of it (And since no salesperson deigned to talk to me to let me know otherwise), it seemed like the furniture upholstery only came in this color, and in this linen-like, sack-like fabric. I know now after looking at the website that there are actually a multitude of fabrics and colors to choose from. Why they would put the same exact, pedestrian shade and fabric on all their furniture, on all 3 floors? Variety is good! It lets customers know that your furniture is customizable!

The only person there that actually talked to me was their valet, who thanked me and wished me a good day even though I didn't use their services. Their salespeople could take some lessons in customer service from him!I really wanted to like this place, and, in some ways, I do like it, but it's just too problematic.  First, while I am a fan of cool, rare to unique t-shirts, I'm not quite sure overpaying for average to slightly better than average t-shirts is what I was looking for.  I have a pretty decent hat that I bought from here and a few shirts, they do have some nice sales, but the owners need some help on how to treat customers.

While I may not look like a standard-fare, trendy scottsdale guy, wrapped up in affliction and ed hardy, I think owners here are bizarre.  First, every time I see the guy, he has a new look: one time, it was long hair with multiple hair colors and a large patch of the hair on the top of his head missing, and another time he looked like he was trying to give Michael Jackson pointers on how to be a weirdo.  Needless to say, I've seen and interacted with my share of weirdos, but the guy really has a lot of gall in the way he speaks to customers.  Maybe, and this is just a suggestion, he should place a "Members Only" sign on the door.

In any event, the bottom line is that this store, at least for the men's clothing, is overpriced and, most times, you have to deal with a shady character of an owner.  Hmm, maybe he should close the place down, I'll reopen it and sell something completely opposite, say, preppy boating and golfing attire, and he can be treated like the douche when he comes in.  Sounds good to me, but I wonder what the cougars in search of hiphugging jeans will think?  Hmm...Checked this place out today for lunch as a possible spot to watch NFL games. Took advantage of their lunch menu and got the sliders. I get my bill and $2.50 is added to my bill for a beverage.  I was drinking water. Apparently, you have to buy a drink to take advantage of the lunch specials. I was not informed of this and was pissed. On top of that the sliders were mediocre at best.  These specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy. A heads from the bartender about the beverage deal would have been nice. When I questioned the bill, the original bartender who took my drink order said, "she didn't tell you?" I'm not going back to this place.Average food. The waitress was pretty rude and gave us problems with the Groupon we had.All I can is MEH.  For the price point, I thinking the food to die for.  But I can't express how average it was for me.  First, the place was deserted, like two other parties in the whole joint. Huh....interesting. 

We went to Morton's to celebrate a friends birthday. They did it right with personalized menus and confetti on the table.  Hands down it was awesome. The gesture is pretty awesome since most places don't come close to that.  

I ordered a salad and the filet mignon tacos. I was that hungry.  The salad was cool.  The tacos you get more of everything else but filet, and should be called tacos of condiments hahahaha. The filet looked like beef jerk or barbacoa.  For me the best was the berries and cream.  Absolutely amazing!  

Just overall not impressed with the price and selection.  Maybe I partial to my favorites.We ended up going here cause we were in the area and craving sushi. I wish we would have drove a little further cause this place has gone down hill. I used to go here a few years ago and i use to like it. I guess there are so many sushi places now and they are just better than Ra. We got two sushi rolls and i laught when the waitress brought them to the table. These were the smallest rolls I had ever seen and it was not a half portion cause of happy hour or anything. They were as big around as a quarter. No Kidding! I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good. Teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright. I most likely will not be back but if I find myself there I will get a dinner entree and not the sushi. Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly. Nothing good  to say for the sushi and thats sad when the word sushi is in the name of the restaurant.The next few times that I went in (2 times to be exact), there was a hair in my food. The first time I sent my food back, the 2nd time I spoke with a manager. Since speaking with a manager I have not had a problem, and he was very well-meaning and hospitable. The only thing that keeps me coming back is their garlic citrus yellowtail. It is ridiculously good, when there aren't hairs in it.Poor service - Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent.So I feel like I might be a little harsh....but I came from San Diego and have had high quality fish and better service at a lot more places. Let me get started. 
When we showed up for reverse happy hour on a weeknight I had a reservation which I showed up ready to announce to the host. We stood there for 4 minutes before the bartender actually asked if we planned on sitting, I said yes so he said he would go find someone to help us. After getting our hostess, I informed her of our dinner reservation and that we were there for happy hour. She then sat us without a happy hour menu and gave us an ordering sheet to fill out....without a pen or pencil.
Not off to a good start RA. Might I add I've always been a little against commercial sushi restaurants, and so far...this was reinforcing the reasons why.
BUT the server we then had was amazing! Very sweet and attentive, always asking if we needed anything else and if we had any questions. 
....The food was okay. 
I had ordered a yellowtail roll and spicy salmon roll, both were fishy tasting. More than any other place in Scottsdale that I've tried. 
My boyfriend I really enjoyed the Zonie roll, which was my favorite and the Las Vegas roll which was my boyfriends and I must say, has a great presentation.
If you plan on coming here, sign up for their "hooked up" email list and get new menu updates as well as free gift cards. 
I won't be returning, try the sushi at stingray across the street at Scottsdale Quarter.UPDATED 7/15/10
I used to love this place! The food was always amazing as was the service.  It had been 6 months since I ate here so for my fathers 77th birthday I decided to take him here.  The Paella was out of this world last time...one of those dishes you never seem to forget.  Now I wish we could forget last night.  

We first ordered the potato meatball dish which was still very good.  We also ordered a tamale---no taste!

To get to the point, the food was very blan.  It seemed like the quality of the food bombed badly.  The seafood in the paella was DRY. We barely touched our food but our server didn't notice.  The busser took our food for us but on the comment card in the credit card book I put that the food was below average.  The server, who was very nice was concerned and said she would look into it...but didn't take anything off of our bill.  

Now I have been a server and bartender and I had people eat all thier food and then complain.  Not the case here...we left hungry.  sad! I won't be dining here ever again.  Not for $77



Original------
Food and service was A++.  My only complaint was the seating and chairs.  They use plastic chairs--like cheap lawn chairs.  
You must have the Cuban coffee.I am sorry to report that we were disappointed with our experience, both in food and price. It started off great--tasty mojito (although a little on the sweet side) and we came during Yelp Eats week so there were some discounted apps, entrees, and desserts. We started with the shrimp fritters--those were tasty with the almond pimiento sauce--and the green plantains. The sauce served with the plantains was too watery to hold up to the dense starchiness of the plantains so we ordered a side of their homemade banana-guava ketchup. That was delicious and did the trick. They ended up not having one of the advertised Yelp Eats entrees. I thought that was pretty poor form--if they are running a special for a week they should not run out. I ended up ordering fried pork morsels from the full price menu. The pork was so dry that I could barely swallow it, even after dipping it in the sauce. There was no changing the fact that it was simply deep-fried pork chunks--not worth the $21 price tag. I sent the dish back and when I didn't want to order something else off the menu we were reminded that that fine print states that you are not allowed to split Yelp Eats discounted entrees, as if we had planned to send back the full-price dish. After that, we were ignored by the wait staff. The dish we split (bistec cubano) was good, so I can't complain, but wouldn't have been worth it at full price. We finished the meal off with flan and cafe cubano. One cafe was sweetened appropriately, the other had no sugar whatsoever. Food is overpriced and not that great. I certainly won't be returning.Were do we start? My reservation was made for 8:15 pm. which we were there on time for. We were told to wait outside which we did. After almost half an hour, we decided to ask what was taking so long and realized that they had forgotten about us. When I went to enquired what was taking so long, I spoke to the owner which to my surprised WASN'T even CUBAN, which should have been an indicator as to what was to come:

-Although the food wasn't bad, it is NOT AUTHENTIC CUBAN FOOD.
-The black beens had some vinegary-spicy ingredient 
 -The Ropa Vieja had more bell peppers and onions than beef. 
-Being Cuban, I found it odd to be served a over pressed cuban sandwich with congri (rice & beens) 
-Las Masitas de Puerco (pork) wore over fried and dry.
-And to add to it being not authentic, it was really expensive in comparison to real cuban restaurants.

All I can say is if you are hungry and welling to pay more for Non-authentic Cuban Food this is the place for you.

La Cubanita!Over priced, and that goes for everything on the menu. I was not happy with the size or the taste or lack of taste I shoud say. Over cooked bacon, like a little black, avocado that was brown, and not $10 worth of turkey. I did like the rye bread. I  will come back to try the bagels cause what I saw I liked. If your compairing this place to Chompies then my vote is Chompies hands down no contest. Even thou I spen $10 on a sandwich there I always leave happy, full, and sometimes with a doggie bag cause you get your moneys worth and its good enough to want again later. The inside of this place is really big with lots of seating and a bar as well. The staff was nice and the place was very clean. Ill give the bagels a try sometime.Don't send your kids to any of their summer programs. My daughter (6yrs old) went and had a terrible experience, and we ended up just pulling her out. They spent the majority of their time just in a room supervised by a couple of girls just left to play with the toys there or do whatever. We weren't happy with it at all.

Giving them 2 stars just because the club itself looks nice.I took a tour of this health club over a year ago.  It's very close to my place but I felt like I stepped into a time warp.  The facility is clean but it was so outdated.  I live in a condo complex that has a beautiful pool and gym so for me to spend extra money to join a club it needs to be nice.  When I took the tour the guy that was showing me around gave me a hard sell.  He did mention that the owners of the place owned it outright.  I am wondering why don't they spend the money to update it?  They would get so many more members if it was updated.  I ended up trying the facility out for two months when they had a groupon special and took tennis lessons.  Even though the facility was included with the tennis lessons I couldn't get myself to use the facility.  Even the vibe is pretty dark in there.  Also I got the impression that it was very chaotic and no one really seemed to know what was going on.  The service was not good...I have definitely experienced better! Let's see, so I first brought my car here to get the brakes done and they did a pretty good job, although, every time I'm in reverse, my brakes do make a squeaking noise. Not sure what's up with that. Anyway, needless to say, they did a pretty good job on my brakes. 

Since my last brake job, they have switched managers and the service has kinda gone down hill. I brought my car in to have the control arm bushings done. They quoted me a little under $500 to have this done, which wasn't really that much cheaper than the dealer. The dealer was about $50 more and would have given me a loaner vehicle to use. 

Anyway, I brought my car in to have them work on it. I dropped it off at 12:00pm, which was my scheduled appointment time. At 2:30pm I received a call from the manager stating that they ordered the wrong part and couldn't do the work on the car today. He told me I could either pick it up or just leave it there. I'm not sure why it took 2 1/2 hours to figure out that you ordered the wrong part...but I didn't have 2 days to spend on having my vehicle repaired. I mean, my whole day was pretty much wasted. 

I decided to pick my car up and call around to see if there was another repair shop to do the work I requested. I wound up finding Kelly's Automotive Repair in Fountain Hills to do the work for $357 including parts, labor, shop supplies, etc. Needless to say, because Just Brakes was incompetent in ordering the wrong part...and taking 2 1/2 hours to figure it out, they lost my business. Silver lining is that I saved over $100 by them doing that.

I'll probably bring my car back for them to look at why my brakes squeak when I back up, since they were the last ones who did my brakes. Other than that, I don't really trust them anymore.The fondue style is kind of fun and the service is outstanding. The food it's self was not real exciting. The "Cheddar Cheese" fondue was no where near cheese - I'm not sure what it was. My husband and his buddy had one drink and then were cut off. Our friend is a little loud and flamboyant so maybe they thought he was drunk. Anyway, it was kind of a bummer for my birthday. The place is ultra quiet. Maybe it's supposed to be romantic, but I think it would great for families and kids.We used to be fans of this place, but we noticed that around 11/2008 they changed their prices and their menu, and we haven't been back since. They do have the best green corn tamale in PHX, but I used to get their nachos, and now they are less than half the serving and about the same price. I know the economy sucks, but they are a tad too expensive for what they serve now. 

Not a fan any more!This place is worthless if you need immediate care during the day!!! My kitty has chronic UTIs that can lead to severe and life threatening blockages. On several occasions they have done little or nothing to accommodate him during such instances....stating that they are booked and that I should visit an emergency vet. Well then why am I paying you monthly if you can never see my pet when he needs to be seen? I was told "you do know this is a wellness clinic?" So, apparently sick pets are not a priority for them. The Desert Ridge location is FAR better about getting him in...even when they are full, they squeeze him in between patients. It is a shame, because I really like Dr. Cherico. Furthermore, the techs are not very skilled in handling feisty pets. My other cat does not like coming to the vet, at all, and often becomes very agitated. One instance the techs left me in the room for 20 minutes to try and get my hissing, spitting, and scratching cat in her crate by myself. During a subsequent teeth cleaning she was allowed to scratch herself in her own eye leading to an eye infection that became an ear infection as well. It was awful. I do not recommend the 90th location at all!!!Not great salsa and not a lot of options for the vegetarian. Oh well, ok place for a quick lunch.Horrible service and hot drinks. Also had multiple u tinsel that were dirty. When i spoke with the manager she commented that the dishes at times get dirty because of the queso. On top of all that, the food was smothered in cheese to cover the dense content inside.Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke.As relocated New Yorkers, we have searched for a good deli to satisfy our noshing needs. Sadly, this is not that place. The bagels tasted like Wonder Bread. You can get better Nova at Costco. The one thing NYC you ask? The prices! WAY too high given the mediocre food. So, We keep looking ...I was not impressed with this clinic. 
Pros:
1. The vet did tell us where to find pet meds for a cheaper price

Cons: 
1.Their website was not up to date as far as their location and address. 
2. The staff was not very friendly. 
3. I felt very rushed to get in and out 
4. Received a card in the mail and thought it might be a welcome note but it was a request for referrals!The Chart House has been a restaurant that has been around for ages (nationally), and unfortunately, it's starting to show.  This seems to be a place that has "grown" with its clientele -- those people who come here are the same families that have been coming for years, but are now bringing their children and grandchildren.  There is nothing wrong with that (my family has its faves), but I might just be too late attempt to add another.  As such, the Chart House, while perfectly picturesque and with decent service, just isn't a culinary star in Scottsdale.

More specifically, my wife and I ordered the coconut shrimp and the blue-cheese/panko crusted asparagus for appetizers.  Admittedly, the coconut shrimp was a "throw-away" dish -- it's our go-to at Outback, and we had a craving.  The asparagus was a bit different, but enjoyable -- it wasn't pretty, but it certainly had us talking about it as the high-point afterwards.  The macadamia crusted mahi was simply so-so.  While not bad, the fish wasn't flaky and the sauce (peanut something-or-other) was so heavy it masked the mahi flavor.  My wife's ceasar salad had 3 croutons in total on it -- not a deal breaker, but it seemed pre-prepared.  But the one thing that customers need to know, the prepared cocktails (at ~$10 a pop) and really light on the pours and even lighter on the flavor (e.g. pineapple caipirhana) -- we couldn't justify getting a second drink with the entree.

We had high hopes for this place (we had been to the one in San Diego years ago), and unfortunately, it would not be a place we would actively choose to go again.  That being said, we wouldn't say "no" if someone really wanted to go.  In our estimation, it was simply an overpriced so-so restaurant.  If it weren't for the lovely view, I think our night would have underwhelmed completely.My client and I will occasionally loiter on the patio for afternoon meetings at Busters. The location is nice, it's a cute little spot next to the "lake." As I've never eaten in the restaurant, my review will only cover the patio and bar app menu. So in no particular order, my observations. 

The patio needs more umbrellas, or perhaps a nice solar sail. Western exposure in the afternoon ... need I say more? The clientele around us was rather ... entertaining (yes, sorry I know that's snarky). It was an odd mix of bridge club and bar star.

The waitstaff is friendly enough, but during slow afternoon hours is busy with side work and tends to forget about you. I had to go inside to get my first drink since I missed her when everyone else ordered.  

The beer selection is very good, but the food is pretty bland. My last visit we ordered the artichoke dip with chips. There were not enough chips to go around for three people, and the dip was rather mealy. I've had better dip from Costco.

I wouldn't go there on my on volition, but it's okay for a meeting.We go to Oregano's for two things- Pizza and salads.  Tonight, we went for a giant salad and a piece or two of pizza.  When our waitress took our order, she said that they were low on romaine lettuce- (the main ingredient of  most of their salads) and asked if they could add some spinach. There were 5 of us, and most did not like spinach, so we were very disappointed, and wanted the manager to know.  He told us that he made 3 trips to the grocery store that day, and bought them out of romaine lettuce.  Then we found out they were not low on romaine, they were out.  I don't know how that happens, but it doesn't seem like that's a way to run a restaurant.  The manager knew that we were very disappointed guests, and did not offer anything to win us over or make us want to go back.So I'm a typical dumb american who's been to New York several times and then drives by Ray's and says "HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A RAY'S PIZZA HERE!!!!!!" 

No. 

Epic fail dumb American, See "copying business practices" in business ethics book.

I understand that Ray's Pizza in NYC is for the most part independent but,I'm not that impressed with "Rays Pizza" in AZ, I'm just....not.

I don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too high everytime I  pull up to the place or, if I'm just going when my pizza palate isn't at it's peak.

Either way, both times I've gone, I mean yeah I'm satisfied and all but a part of me says, Meh, I've had better. 

The slices out front look delicious but just IMO fail to deliver the extraordinary cheese, greasy meats and crispy/chewy crust that all come with the NY pizza dining experience.

I guess it's okay, I just feel you can get a better slice from NYPD pizza or Joe's in old town.Meh. I feel like the pizza at streets of new york is pretty plain jane.

I came here for lunch with my boyfriend, the restaurant was clean and not too busy. Actually,  it wasn't busy at all.

Our server was nice, but we didn't see much of her so when we needed something,  she was nowhere to be found. 

We were pretty hungry so we started off with the garlic bread sticks. When they came out, it looked like melted cheese on hot dog buns. The bread was frozen previously,  you could tell by the way the bread reheated and tasted. The marinara dipping sauce was also very watery and tasteless. 

When our pizza came out, there was so much grease on it, I was surprised.  The pizza was also pretty plain. Nothing special. 

Overall,  I'd say that streets of new york is an over priced pizza place fir those who also enjoy pizza hut & dominoes.over crowded, under staffed, and not very clean.  my suggestion would be to go on a Monday or Tuesday.  It is not a fun place for little ones any more. Apparently now tweens and teens like to spend friday nights there instead of at the mallI didn't have such a great experience. I ordered 5 tires for my vehicle I was given an awesome price when I called the first time, when I called back to make the purchase the price went up over 200 dollars. I asked what happened and the guy couldn't tell me, He said " I don't know why its a different price" so 20 minutes in he got the price down a little bit. I paid for the tires even though the were now 110 dollars more than the first price, and then he said you should have 3 by tuesday and 2 by wednesday because they are coming from texas. The first call he said they were all in stock, so at this point I was like whatever I can wait til wednesday and then I got my tracking numbers that said I won't see them til friday. So I called first thing in the morning and asked what happened he said UPS changed it and he said he will send the issue to customer service and see if they will send a discount  back to me. I checked my email 10 minutes later he issued me a 25 dollar credit, I called customer service and they were full of excuses and it was very apparent that customer satisfaction isn't as important as they claim it is.. Sounds like Big O tires needs my business next time..Got less than a handful of fries with my sandwich.  Slow, indifferent service.  A manager who was the gate keeper at the door.  Really underwhelmed.  I had not eaten at a Mimi's in 10 years (I left AZ for 7 years), I probably wont be going back.I've been patronizing Mimi's for over 30 years and I am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point, at least at this location.  I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  

The biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.

Our server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.

Although I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live.It's getting harder and harder to support this hockey team. For the last three years, I have heard all the song and dance about mixing the young stars with some veteran leadership, and they fall short of making the playoffs, or even making it an interesting season! They seem to fall flat on their collective faces when it's time for a playoff run in the last 3/4 of the season. While its nice to think they are actually going to go somewhere one day, now we have to assume they will suck year after year, and it "just nice to have a hockey team in the Valley."  That, and you eventually form the opinion that you are going to see "real" teams play because you are going to see the other teams in the league, and not the home club.This place never gets it right. I recently took my car in for their $26 oil change/lube/car wash special, where you basically get a free car wash. The service guy was very nice, noting things I probably should replace, but that I could wait on for another few thousand miles.  He did let me know that I needed a new air filter and offered to upgrade the car wash to a supreme if I went ahead and replaced the filter, which I agreed to. However, I specifically asked that they 1) not forget to include the air freshener, which my mom said they always forget , and 2) vacuum the interior very well, since I'd had my dogs in the car and hairs were all over. I get the bill for my car and they've charged me for the upgrade to supreme car wash, so I have to have them remove the charge. Then I get my car and they've forgotten the fragrance. Finally, I get home and look at the hatch area of the interior to find it covered in sand and dog hairs, like they never even vacuumed at all, let alone vacuuming especially well, like I requested. This place is for the birds, to be polite, but they do have a very nice waiting area, if that's what you like in a car wash.Car must be washed and these guys wash cars right? Well they seem more like carnies at the state fair trying to sell you everything under the sun. Back off and wash my damn car! I don't want a windshield repair (does it look cracked?), a carpet cleaning, detail job, oil change or anything else - except maybe gas.The food is decent but this place is FILTHY! The bathroom had pee everywhere! The staff was just standing behind the counter while they were out of three kinds of beverages. It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time. I like the food but I'll never eat at a baja fresh again!Boo hiss your TV dinners are less salty than your food fresh from this restaurant. Used to love Boston Chicken but it's declined too much.I've been to Scottsdale Nails twice, today was my second time. The first time I went I had a great experience and even started telling my friends to try it out. Today was a different story...

I always get the same gel color and noticed they had it last time I was in which was 2 weeks ago. I looked for it forever through the endless bottles they have to choose from (shouldn't that be their job?) and was unable to find what I was looking for. I was told I could start my gel manicure and they would look for it later. I was not comfortable with that and told them I wanted a specific color and if they didn't have it I would like to go to the Nail salon I knew would have it. They finally found it and sat me down. Linda was my tech and she immediately began to file my polish off which I asked politely not to do since I've had issues with them being filed in the past creating brittle nails that bleed from being so thin. She argued with me and said soaking would take too long, she even had another nail tech try and talk to me about it. I continued to ask for it to be soaked off just like they did last time. For goodness sakes why is that such a difficult request??? Finally she did what I was asking and then would not stop telling me how wrong I was about the filing causing my nails to be so thin, painful and bleed. I told her she was not correct that since I've asked people not to file the color off I've had no problems. We went back and forth many times. She also kept walking away and talking on her phone then went to an area by the restroom where many other tech were standing around and all of them were laughing and one even pointed at me!!! I can't tell you how angry I was! Here I am paying for a service and am trying to be nice and had a few requests that were not that big of a deal. I don't think I will ever go back. I will go back to my previous salon and bring my friends with me! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I had a better experience the first time or else it would be 1!Seriously...you are just better off going to Wendy's or Whataburger down the street and sitting inside if you want a burger...their burgers are better, their service is faster, the bill is cheaper.  

My hamburger last night was clearly two frozen patties grilled with toppings. I make these at home or on weekends all the time. 

The value for quality isn't there.Short version? Not a horrible place for lunch - their food is good - but their recent price increase and changes have pushed them over the edge of a place that's worth going to. There are better options.

My office is close, and i've been eating there on a fairly regular basis for about the last 4 years, but it's now officially out of my rotation for good. In addition to prices going up, they've also changed their available items you can get as a side with things like sandwiches and burgers. Used to be you could get a small side salad in exchange for fries, if you wanted a healthy option. Not any more. (still have a couple other options - cottage cheese, for example.) And i would generally be okay with this change, if they would give you fair warning. Instead of notifying me that the salad i asked for would be extra, they just charged me $3.99, which seems a bit much for a side salad. In addition, they didn't bring the fries (or ask what side i actually wanted) that were suppose to come with the turkey burger. Overcharged and shorted a side item - nice! 

Like i said, the actual food is good, which counts for something i suppose, but it's not good enough. Not enough to pay $18 (after tip) for a side salad, turkey burger, and glass of water. No thanks.I have always loved this restaurant, but have had to stop going to it because my last 3-4 experiences were not very good ones.

The last time we were there I ordered a chicken chimichanga and they brought me what was either fish or undercooked chicken. I took one bite and then looked at it and it was pink. Chicken obviously isn't supposed to be pink. I sent it back and got another one and it was ok, but still not all that tasty.

The time before that my pollo fundido had cinnamon on it as if it had been fried in old oil that had been used to fry a dessert or something. Not only did it taste disgusting, but I am allergic to cinnamon, and having it in my food obviously isn't a good thing.

The time before that we had a fairly rude waiter.

Not sure why I kept going back. I guess because I had always enjoyed their food before. I love their bean dip and salsa, but I just can't go back anymore. I'm bummed, truthfully.It seems like whenever I go in to this store what should only take 5 minutes to do ends up taking 20. It doesn't help that this company has the worst customer service year after year.On my visit to purchase a $6-8k spa, I was ignored completely by everyone I walked up to.  After several laps around the spa area, and about 10 minutes of this BS, I went back to the front of the store, to the customer service counter, to ask for help.  I stood there another few minutes while 4 sales clerks discussed a clearly more important customer than I (who all told spent about an hour with several sales people, was clearly price shopping, and ended up not buying ANYTHING).

I finally got some "service" once they realized I actually wanted to give them thousands of dollars.  Hilariously, the sales guy kept touting their fantastic service, which based on how I just had been completely ignored, I don't exactly believe. 

They also sell tons of patio furniture and some awful yard "decor" (who buys this crap??)

Bottom line: look like you have tons o' money (read: older and rude, demanding personality) and you'll get service, regardless of whether you have intentions of actually buying anything.Overall: I was underwhelmed by my visit.  We went on a week night and ate indoors.  We were expecting a fun, kitschy, dining experience (we were on vacation), but found ourselves eating in a dark, dank, musty room filled with ties; we found it dull and uncomfortable.  If you want a P.P. 'experience" I would suggest eating outside (to avoid the funky smell inside, if nothing else) on a nice evening; they had live music.  

Food: I am a vegetarian in a family of non-veggies, so I can't provide a first-hand evaluation of the food. My family seemed to enjoy their steak and chicken salad, but the "extras" (1/3-of-a-corn-on-the cob and baked beans) left a lot to be desired.  

One thing I was a bit surprised by was that I have been to several steakhouses before, but each seemed to have one thing on the menu for non-meat eaters like a veggie burger or a pasta dish that could be made w/out meat.  P.P.P. did not have anything at all except for a baked potato and the child's mac'n'cheese.  Oh well.Service was fast and prompt however we all left feeling the food was nothing special potatoes were cold and I am not sure if the omelets were actually cooked in house tasted premade and warmed up in a microwave. I had a professional chef with me and he agreed, there were no skillet cook marks on it and it seemed rubberyI usually go to the good egg at thunderbird and Scottsdale road and love it but tried the boulder location since I was in the area. Sat out on the patio and it is a beautiful setting besides the bird problem, they are a little aggressive and clean the plates when customers get up to leave. Service was a little slow but it was early so they probably had not got in the swing of things. Ordered eggs over easy with whole wheat toast dry. It came fast but eggs were scrambled with white bread. I asked server and she said they were out of whole wheat and if I wanted her to she would fix the eggs but her attitude was the worst. Made me feel like I unconvinced her by the question. Not a great experience. Asked manager as I paid on the way out and she said they had plenty of wheat. Will stick with thunderbird location from now onSome of the worst service I've received in awhile. I was passing through town to go mountain biking at McDowell Mtn. Park and wanted to grab a slice of pizza. The place wasn't busy because it was around 1:30 pm but the service was very slow and inept. It took about 15 minutes for the girl to slice off a slice of already baked pizza, stick it back in the oven, and then put it in a medium size to-go box even though I asked to eat it in at the restaurant. Also, the place was very dingy and dirty. The window coverings had dust on them like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Skip it.Great patio ambiance but most limp Caesar salad ever & drenched in dressing.  Wings okay but ordered as appetizer 10 minutes before entrees and all arrived at the same time.so far, not impressed. walked in, place has 1 table full of about 8 people. and  a couple people waiting for food. other then that, all the other tables are vacant, and dirty! it's not busy, why isn't it clean? i sit at a dirty table... dude says it will be 6-7 minutes and if i mind the wait... i said no. 10 minutes go by, and i only ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. you think this would be ready at lunch time, right? maybe not...so it takes longer then what he said... i get it in 15.. and it is just cheese pizza re heated up with whatever topping you want, not fresh.... but hot as hell! sauce is not very tasty, dough is very bland. the cheese was really good though, and the hint of italian herbs seasoning help the taste. The crust was nice and crisp though... i wont be back. food didn't do it for me. even if a place is dirty and unorganized, i'll still come back if the food is awesome!!! but not the case at Pisa Pizza. It's ok food with a dirty atmosphere, 2 tv's and only 1 on playing nothing interesting.... very boring nothing special, not very good service.... i'll say no more.Found a big piece of glass in my husband's lemon filled powdered donut this morning. 
This is our go to store for donuts..they make them from scratch. 
They are usually great... He swallowed some of it...I took it and the piece of glass back to the store and showed it to the Bakery Manager and I said I would take all the lemon donuts off the shelf....the store manager refunded my money.
when I was leaving. . I noticed the lemon filled donuts were still on the shelf. ..

Buyer beware...Sorry to say this place has been better in the past.  It is in need of a really deep cleaning, there is a funky odor of natural gas when you walk in the door.  The gluten free pizza we had was very good, next time I will just order carry out-not eat in.  If you do eat in and order wings, make sure you tell them if you want them to come out BEFORE your pizza, otherwise everything comes out at the same time.Went to a day game on 3/27/10 against the SF Giants  Plenty of fans of both teams were in attendance.  I'd have to say this stadium was more like an old minor league ballpark - sparse, not a lot of fluff, needing some renovation, but sufficient to host baseball games for plenty of fans.  The grandeur of the signage on outside of the stadium belies the inside condition.

Parking was fairly easy, and only $5. Despite signs disallowing tailgating, there was plenty of that, including lots of people throwing balls in the parking lot where cars were moving around.  Parking lot staff did nothing to stop them.  On the other end of the lot we were in were the practice fields, and when we arrived the Angels were just finishing their batting practice so there was a huge crowd of people standing around at the far end of our lot..

Going in, we stood in one line and got all the way up to the ticket lady before finding out that they had a _separate_ line for tickets purchased on line, so had to move to the other side of all the intake lines, and  stand in line again to enter.  The lack of signage for that was annoying.  I must also say that the lady who checked my purse for contraband did the most thorough job of any purse-checking person I've ever seen.  She was in everything!

We had cheap bleacher seats just beyond first base for this game.  They were fine, but they were also in the sun for the whole game.  Didn't care for the fellow next to me constantly and loudly talking to his friends in our row and the row behind, but that's not the stadium's fault.  One funny thing was that it appeared that the players had to actually pass through the public portion of the stadium to get from the practice field to the game field, including coming across the concourse where the concession stands were, among the fans, and down the steps where the seats were in left field.  It presented a good opportunity for fans to ask for autographs, for sure, but somehow it struck me as weird.  That would never happen in a major league park.

We walked around the whoie stadium to see what they had, and were strangely unimpressed.  Food selection was fairly standard for stadiums, nothing special there.  My BF liked their beer selections.

Leaving the game afterwards was really bad as traffic was only superficially directed by stadium staff and Tempe PD, both of whom seemed surprisingly confused on what needed to happen.  It took more than a half hour to drive the two blocks away from the stadium exit.  You'd think that after having four week of games there (and doing it for four years), they'd have figured it out better, esp. since they knew ahead of time that the game was sold out..

I think we can put Tempe Diablo Stadium in the "been there, done that" category now.  We had a good time, but probably won't move any mountains to go again for a few years.First, this is my favorites Sub Factory location. It's the only one with the seafood sub. As a whole I'm not a huge fan of the chain, the food is low quality, bland, and unoriginal.I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, it's just a delicious sandwich... I can't speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the "kids" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich.I really love finding new bagel joins to try out. Ever since I moved to Tempe I've been looking for a great bagel place close to me, but this one just misses the mark. Small bagels, dense dough, microwaved egg, ham and cheese, and cheap ham at that. Breakfast sandwich for $5 is quite standard for a non-fast food place, but it didn't really taste much better than a fast food breakfast sandwich. There are many better bagel places in the valley...probably won't be coming back.
Had no problems with the staff.I made a few trips to this mall during our week in the Phoenix area.  

The Nike Outlet was great, but otherwise, there weren't that many quality outlet stores.  Most (or so it seemed to me) of the stores in this mall are not outlets and there just weren't the deals that I was expecting.Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.My husband and I don't eat at chain restaurants very frequently...we try to avoid them when possible.  Saturday night when trying to decide where to go out for dinner (we are running out of food in our house), I had a list of places I want to try. However, my husband didn't want to spend more than $30 on dinner (no clue why), so all of my ideas were out the window.  We decided on Applebee's since I had a slight craving for a mucho mudslide.

The only highlight of our trip to Applebee's was my mucho mudslide (it was yummy).  My fried chicken salad was large for a half-size and was pretty good.  I'd be concerned if a place could really mess something up as simple as that. My husband got the ultimate trio (basically he got to pick three appetizers)...he ordered the mozzarella sticks (blah...they were barely hot and not as good as they used to be back in the day); the sliders (what is up with every place, not fancy and fancy, having sliders on the menu nowadays??), and chicken wraps (Chris said they were OK).  

Our service was worse than the food. It took over 10 minutes after we placed our drink order for our drinks to appear on the table. No clue why it took that long because the bar area wasn't busy and the bartender didn't look backed up.  Second, it took our food forever to come out...we have no clue why.  A mother and daughter walked in after we placed our dinner order and when I glanced over wondering where our food was, I noticed they were eating! They got food before we did!!! GRRRRRRR.

Our bill came to $28, but it was hardly worth it.  On our drive home, we said we should have just gone to Wendy's for dinner...better quality food at a much much cheaper price.Sebastian the comic does a funny skit on Ross Stores where he talks about finding "a shoe" instead of a pair and how the place looks like"downtown Beirut."

He exaggerates, but you get the point. Items are thrown all over the place at Ross and at a faster rate than the employees could clean them.

The AZ Mills Ross is no exception.

There are some great deals to be found at Ross Stores, but you really need patience.

My problem with the AZ Mills Ross is that the parking lot side registers rarely open, no matter how long the line is up front. Customers also can't do returns on the back registers.

Also, this Ross just seems to be more cramped than others. Possibly because it's a mall store or maybe it's just situated poorly. 

The shoe row intrudes into the clothing and it ends at a busy corner making it difficult to get by.  It used to be in the back corner near linins where it worked better. 

Outstanding deals can be found on shoes, clothes, luggage, DVDs
and name brand linens. 

Prices for accessories like hats, socks and underwear are also good.

I preferred the Mesa store (Alma School/Southern) but it recently closed. There's a store in Tempe Marketplace and a new one coming right up the road on Southern and McClintock. 

This one is just too cramped, lines too long and sometimes racks are too packed with clothes that they're difficult to sort through.The pros:
- relatively good coffee
- convenient location
- the ambiance (at times)

The cons:
- slow service (staff seems constantly overwhelmed)
- cleanliness: observed dirty counters, unsafe food handling techniques
- outside seating comfort:  smoking areas are less than 10 feet from entrances and patrons end up having to walk through it.  The outside reeks of cigarette smoke. 

Honestly, if you're looking for a place to quickly hook up to wifi to get work done while getting a good coffee, you could manage it.  Don't attempt any work by phone though, the area is too noisy.  It could be done better by posting a reserved smoking area to the rear of the establishment, thus preventing customers from being inundated with smoke.I'm sorry. The burnt drip coffee is definitly not enough to get me to come back. Service is extremely friendly, but the coffee is NOT WORTH IT. Weak, burnt, watery.....this is a coffee place and therefore I am juding based on the coffee. Don't hate.It's the only "all ages" venue for miles, so it was weird to see 12 year old punk rock kids slam dancing with adults. A little disturbing, too.... but funny, for sure.

The mixed drinks aren't designed to be tasty, they are designed to get people super fucked up and come in a giant mug. That should tell you something. They had to call an ambulance for one girl who apparently slammed 2 long islands and passed out. Two? They are gigantic. Think like 7 in normal terms, maybe. 

There was a video on the TV over the bar playing, in which people were beating each other up with metal folding chairs. 

I wish I were making this up.

If you want to see a bunch of mediocre bands and maybe a good one, once in a while, bring some friends and get trashed. I repeat - definitely bring your own company.Gas service is good here as prices are less than the surrounding locations; unfortunately, service in the store is sadly lacking.

Walking into the store, sometimes there is a security person who is watching.  Not sure what they are watching, as half of the folks walk out without having their bags or receipts checked, while the other half are asked for their receipts and to take their items out of the bags to verify the items in the bags are on the receipts.  

The store has more groceries and other items than the Frys at Southern and Mill; it carries less inventory than the location at McClintock and Baseline.  For some reason, there is a greater security presence here than either of the other two stores.  In shopping morning and evening, the number of cashiers varies widely...from more than 5 earlier in the day to none later in the day.

When I am checking out, I like personal service instead of the self-checkout.  It is easier to check out with someone behind the register instead of relying on the computer.

I guess I am going to have to treat all Frys stores the same way...they need to EARN my business.Texting while making a salad is not appreciated. Management has no control over staff who text while restocking or not restocking salad bar, texting while cashiering and who knows who else is texting. You also got that one big dude just standing over the bread area like a monster watching every move you make. 
It was Italy week or something also.
Tortellini salad was good
Chicken soup good, cornbread and cheese bread good, yogurt good. One soda machine laughable. 

Pasta soup not good, most stuff just average, no non-fat dressings.
Good thing I had a coupon. Maybe the employee was texting out coupons - doubt it. save it for home pal.It wasn't a very big coffee shop. My boyfriend and I met a small group of friends around 2 pm on a Saturday. The place was crowded with people stopping in. There was only one person to run the counter so the service was pretty slow. I told the woman I found the place on Yelp because it said to mention that for a .50 off per drink discount. She didn't give us the correct discount. I guess I should've spelled it out so she understood what I was wanting. I ordered the Mocha Especiale. It was alright, but it tasted a little gritty to me. So, overall I wasn't that impressed and it's a place I can live without.Two stars seem kind of low, but the description of "Meh.  I've experienced better" is suitable.  Three stars is "A-OK," not how I would describe this place.  I love to support local business - would much rather give my money to a local business owner than some big chain conglomerate.  Sorry Gold Bar, but you'll have to do better if you want to earn business from me.  I won't support local business if they aren't up to standards.  

This was the first time that I have visited this place.  I waited a very long time to place my order with just one person ahead of me.  It seemed to take the coffee person 10 minutes to make one coffee drink.  I ordered some kind of iced tea.  They used the same tea bags that I use at home, nothing special, it wasn't a loose leaf specialty, which is what I would expect from the prices they charge.  I also have to question how old that tea was - it certainly tasted like it was old.......

I waited for a very long time to get my tea.  I finally went up to the counter to ask and they said, "Oh, we put orders over on the other side."  I would have thought that they would have called out my order when it was ready rather than just leaving it sit there on the counter.  That's what most places do!  

This place was crowded on the day that I was there, which surprised me.  Lots of people with computers doing work and a few study groups with toddlers running around.  It seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there.  Wondering why so many people go there......

The other thing that I really disliked was that I had to go into the back of the place to use the restroom.  Dark, dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind.  Yuck - if the bathrooms and back of house aren't clean, it makes me wonder about the rest of the place........Just so-so for a coffee place. There's a nice atmosphere and plenty of space if you wanted to study or chat with friends. The biggest problem though are the drinks. When a large chain like Starbucks or the independently owned coffee place that took up residence in your previous location has you beat on pricing, there had better be some mind blowing quality to back it up. Sadly, I was disappointed in the results.

For two tall (12oz) iced drinks we spent $10, and a dollar of which was just for the ice! Seriously, there's no reason to charge an extra $0.50 just to ice my drink down and so far this is the only place that charges extra for a cold drink. As for the pricing, I could walk out of most other coffee places with a Venti (20oz) or more for that price. Still though, I was hopeful in the quality of the coffee.

There's a unique combination of flavored mochas that you can order like the Milky Way Mocha, the Almond Joy mocha, and Black Forest Mocha just to name a few. The flavors sound great in thought but in practice there wasn't much to write home about. I got the Milky Way mocha since the combination of white chocolate, dark chocolate, and caramel sounded like a good mix. Would have been better of asking for an espresso in a glass of milk because that's mostly what I got. None of the other flavors were present except for coffee laced milk. Now I know that's what most of these mocha drinks are but at least there's a hint of the flavor that was ordered. Not a bit of it in this one.

I'm not sure how their black coffee is so for the manic coffee only drinkers, I can't speak to the quality of their brew. But I can say that $5 for 12oz of milk is way too much. I may try Gold Bar again sometime, but won't be for a whilefirst time here and it was OK. the place smelled real bad, like urine, especially the elevator. service was okay, we had to call the guy over a few times. they didn't even check on us. wings were good, bbq chicken pizza was good except for the fact that it was over powered by a whole bunch of garlic cloves. ugh, i love garlic cloves but man, there was too much on there. the cool thing though is that they have that asian photobooth thing and a karaoke booth!It's like Vegas here.

Full of flashing lights and noises, but no real content or anything to make you stick around too long, but it looks so fun from a distance.The game selection is not too bad. They have a lot of rhythm games, and they're handily bunched together in a room. Overall, though, the games are quite pricey, and certain machines keep breaking down. To be fair, I've put on an extra star for the games since I do find a good amount of them enjoyable. The customer service is deplorable, though.

I want to bring up a few points about the staff. These events have really soured my experience with this location. Normally when I go to Gameworks, I play a few games and everything is fine. However, on two occasions, the staff has been incredibly rude. One night, one of the staff yelled racial slurs at that group out of nowhere. We called upon his manager to get an apology, but the offender only claimed that it was an accident that he yelled out all those words. It was definitely no accident as he tailed our group to the outside of the building and shouted those words.

On a second occasion, after playing a few games with our group, my sister and I sat down and took a break at one of their tables for a few minutes. One of the employees came over and said they were watching us the entire time, and that if we did not play any games, they would ask us to leave the establishment. It is odd that they have been watching us, and it is odd because we HAD been playing games, albeit not as many as the others. I will note that we are Asian and post-college, but we dress and act like any other American women, so I have no idea why we were treated this way.

Despite all this, Gameworks can be a place for a fun outing depending on who is on staff at the moment. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to this location again.

NOTE ADDED 5/15/13: 
Below it seems like a representative of Gameworks offered a way to contact me in regards to my experience. In actuality, no follow up was offered. I emailed him shortly after he left that message, but I received no response in return, so my rating still stands.New York pizza is not made on a conveyor belt oven!  Electric, Coal or Brick are the real ny oven types.

Here they use the same oven that any Papa Johns, Domino's etc uses. it does not create a proper crust, but this is just one of the problems.

The crust seemed to have corn starch or excessive flour on it creating a paste in my mouth with many bites.

The staff seems to be a bunch of high school / college kids who rather be socializing than tossing pizzas.

the inside is large and has decent seating, but why come and sit here when there are many many better options. 

Even their coupon is misleading as with the 1 topping coupon you save a whopping $.75 on the first topping,

Don't come here for pizza it is low quality non NY style food.Soggy crust, unimpressive quality of toppings, WAYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many onions & bell peppers & olives, so not enough meatage (no homo), heavily overpriced ($15 for a small pizza whaaaaaat??) = I. AM. DISAPPOINT.

And still hungry.  For less-sucky pizza, that is.Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place.This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.Native  New Yorker in Tempe was OK, I had not been to this location in several years and was waiting for a friend that lives near this location. 

I know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.

Everything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.

I will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice.Took 20 mins to get an appetizer... then the waiter brought me a bud light when I asked twice for a Budweiser... salsa taste like water and they're nachos were regular cheese half ass melted on chips... this place blows...Big problem when you have a restaurant called Native New Yorker and your manager on duty that night is sporting a full-on tattoo of Fenway Park. New Yorkers and Bostonians do not mix and I know many NY people who won't patronize any places owned or operated by scummy Red Sox fans. Thought I was safe at a place with NY in it's moniker, but apparently at NNY, they allow managers with large exposed tattoos to work there and flaunt the fact openly. "I wear it proudly" he said. Well, dude wear a long sleeve shirt and wear it proud when your out of a New York restaurant. 
    Kudos to the $10 free birthday coupon which got me some good Chicken strippers with Mandarin orange sauce (mild kick) and good steak fries and fresh slaw. Bartender was nice guy too and manager was normal when I asked about the irony of his tattoo, but it needs to be covered at all times while he is there. Let's go Yankees.Went here for lunch and opened the place up at 11AM. It is a very casual spot, with very decent prices. Started off with the traditional chips and salsa. Chips were ordinary and the salsa was a bit watery for my taste. I had the Gollo burro. Very good. I don't know of too many places that serve this style, but I'm into it. The restaurant is located in the corner of a strip mall next to a fry's supermarket and behind the Jack-in-the-box. Inside, it's actually surprisingly spacious, and we had plenty of room in the booths. I'd go back, but there are way too many spots I have ranked higher that it may be a while. Decent, but not outstanding. Maybe I'm picky...Worst customer service I have ever experienced at an Arby's. Maybe they were having a bad day?




Food was still good. Mountain Dew sucked though.I have been going to this store for a few years now for their good selection of fish and aquarium products.  My experiences have mostly been positive and helpful with the exception of a few times waiting to be acknowledged by the staff.  Whlie helpful and knowledgeable, getting their attention can sometimes be difficult, but I'm understanding given the volume of business and the amount of work they must do.  

Today, however, was an appalling experience.  After waiting nearly forty minutes to be acknowledged, I approached a staff member in 'saltwater' for a freshwater fish. I am aware that this may not be their department, but given my simple needs, I didn't assume I would be of great inconvenience.  The staff member I approached seemed to be only wiping down the front of an aquarium, so it didn't seem too much to ask for her to help me with 2 minutes of her time for a couple freshwater fish.

I was met with abject disdain, and was asked "if I only need a couple fish, or if I actually had any questions".  Apparently answering questions is above and beyond her abilties, so I tried to bite my tongue.  As she stammered around the store looking for a net  (yes in a fish store), I inquired if they do any aquarium repair work for my hospital tank, and was met with short, aggravated answers. Her final reply was "try getting some silicone".  Such a fool I am, duh?

As we approached the tank containing the fish I wanted, I dared to ask her if another tank of fish were for sale....she replied, "You're now asking me another question, are you serious"?  What nerve I have asking questions about fish in a fish store from staff members!!!   I flat out told her she was completely ridiculous and could not deal with her.

Long story short, I wanted to leave, but approached a manger who found a different person to help get the 2 little fish I had now waited 53 minutes for.  He offered no apology, simply said 'they're busy people".  Yeah, buddy, so am I.  Well-run businesses don't operate this way.  I have repeatedly recommended this establishment to others for years, but will no longer.  I will not be returning.First and foremost, I would like to recognize Larry Love for putting up with us both to and from Tempe Beach Park.  He was such a good sport as I sang "Larry Love, he's a vegetarian" to the tune (well sort of lol) of the Crash Test Dummies song "Mary Moon" at the top of my lungs.... NOT pretty!  The free shuttle service and Larry as our driver are the only positive things I can come up with. 

We had room 202.  Our room was dark and dingy even with all of the lights on.  The sofa bed was a joke.  Had it not been 2am and had we not already changed into our jammies before we opened it up, we would have gone down to the front desk and asked for another room.  It's obvious the hotel knew there was a problem with it because they had tried to jerry-rig it with tie wraps but it didn't work.  There was no way to comfortably sleep on it.  The mattress fell through the frame.  We told the gal when we checked out but she didn't seem to care.  Didn't make a note of it either so I'm guessing nothing will be done about it.  

The part I am MOST upset with is my daughter lost her iPhone and we were 99.9% sure that it was on the shuttle.  We called the moment we realized it was missing....about 10 minutes after we departed the shuttle and they said it wasn't there.  Then I checked again when we were checking out.  Still nothing.  I gave them my number and said if it turned up to please call me.   She went back over there and asked if SHE could search the shuttle.  They said "well as a matter of fact we did find it about 20 minutes ago but we didn't have a phone number to call anyone."  This was just 2 hours after I had checked out AND left my phone number with them.  Even with insurance on the phone, it's like $150 to replace it.  Would have been beyond angry had we paid that only to find that the phone was on the shuttle as we'd insisted.

The whole experience really made me feel like the hotel didn't give a damn about their customers.This is a large facility with major conference facilities attached. The rooms are *VERY* dated and in serious need for maintenance work. The beds are OK, but the rest of the room is old, out of style, ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues. The airport shuttle was slow. They have a great location and the potential to be OK, but they do not even seen to be trying.A friend of mine decided to pay 20.00 and get a lifetime membership to REI in order to take advantage of their REI Yard sale they have once a year where you can get gear 30-70% off retail price. 

Sounded like a deal so I signed up as well. 

Day of the yard sale there was a huge line waiting to be let into the "Yard Sale Area" which consisted of about 12 tables full of items and they would come refill them occasionally. However, if you were not one of the first 10 people in or you weren't interested in used shoes you were out of luck.

The first 10 people in took the giant camping packs and scooped up ALL of the camping gear into it whether they needed it or not, it was a free for all with people packed in like sardines. I found an air mattress that may or may not have a leak I have yet to test this, however that is what the tag said.

After staying in the sardine can for about an hour I finally decided to take my air mattress inside, they have camping gear during the sale, so they must have killer gear inside.

I go inside and the sticker prices were astronomically high. I am sure you are getting good quality items but for someone who goes camping maybe once or twice a year I could not bring myself to pay full retail on the items they were asking for. I would rather go to Kmart or target and get what I need, heck even Cabella's has better deals.

I hear that the Paradise Valley location handles their Yard Sale differently and takes in groups at a time. Since I have the lifetime membership I will scope it out at least once. 

All in all unless you are going to be back packing all over Europe or living in the wilderness, go find your gear some place cheaper.I stopped into the Horse and Hound to wet my whistle one night before I saw a show at the Clubhouse next door.  I looked around and I thought that the décor was alright, it was a little tacky but I like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.  Keeps shit edgy.  I saw that they had shuffleboard there and virtual bowling.  Everything looked quite promising.    

I started off with a vodka and Red Bull.  The drink was watery, but I didn't mind too much because I seem to remember it was pretty inexpensive.  I played me some virtual bowling and discovered that the trick to do well is to put the least amount of effort into the game as possible.  Once you start caring is when you start fucking up.

All night, I was determined to have a good time, dammit.  I don't like not liking places.  I can overlook shit.  Bathroom smells funny?  That's okay.  Vomit on the light switch?  Kind'a gross, but okay.  But the bartending staff was so rude to me that it was ridiculous.  It felt to me as though I was not welcome there.

My friends and I asked this one middle-aged lady bartender where the discs to play shuffleboard were and she said, "Well, did ya look over there?"  I don't mean like, "Oh, did you look over there?"  I mean, balls out, nasty, "Did ya look over there?" with the same offended gestures you might expect from someone if you'd just asked them if they bleach their butthole.  In truth, no, no we didn't look over there; we decided to ask first due to our geographic location being situated closest to the bar at the time.  Big goddamn deal, just answer the question.  I was gonna get a drink but realized that I was standing under a sign that read:  "Do not stand here!  Your order will NOT be taken!"  How inviting.

Once my drink was finished I asked the bartender if I could have another drink.  I tapped my glass and asked if I could have "another one of these," to which she replied, "What's another one'a these?" with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like I just spit in her face.  Every bar I've ever been to, my bartender knows what drink I had last.  If they don't know, they ask me and they're nice about it.  Bartenders are supposed to be nice, for God's sake.  I was also pretty high as I had only moments before smoked a ton of pot and that was a major buzzkill for me.  Nothing un-highs me like someone being completely unreasonable.  

If I would take more than two seconds to order, I would get an audible, raspy sigh.  "Hi, could I get... hmmm..." *gaaaawwwwwwww!!* Perhaps it's better on different night.  I don't know.  I'm not real anxious about coming back.

Instead of being shitty, treat me like a human being.  I'm like the easiest customer you can get, so to be shitty is really lame.  I've never given back a burger, never complained about a drink and kept my lips zipped that time I found a dead rat in my fries.The place has a lot a variety in hot dogs, so if you wanna try something different than the usual meat and bun, it's a good place to start. If you are already pretty clever with grilling up you own, I think you may be a little disappointed. If you already buy good quality hotdogs, from the store, then the taste won't WOW you.pee.  this place smells like it.  the 2nd star is for Gina, because she's good.Pros: view
Cons: rotten greeter at hostess stand; super slow service...and not professional; worst food I had this year; had to ask for salt and the waitress rolled her eyes at me; extremely expensive...$100 for two entrees and a small salad; I could go on and on, but WOW, what a view.
Note: my daughter joined me half way through dinner and she ordered a side of French fries...cold, undercooked (raw in the middle and soggy), and she had to wait 40 minutes prior to receiving them from the server.The rooms and view were delightful as was the architecture of this facility. I also enjoyed their food and was impressed that they had egg-free desert options (a luxury for those of us with allergies). The bar's signature cocktails were also fresh and fun! That being said I had a bad experience with the front desk and check out service.

For this fabulous hotel I would've expected better customer service. I was here on business and with a large group who was taking care of my stay. When I checked out they said they had a glitch and they'd have to fix it to get that payment through the group and assured me they would work it out. A week later I checked my credit card statement online and sure enough they had charged the bill to my account not the business group I was with. After several phone calls I had it straightened out but I don't think it's acceptable for the front desk to assure me they would when clearly it wasn't within their power and something I needed to follow up on. I probably won't be back.I have written a few tips and want to be fair to Arizona Central Credit Union. Like I said in my tips, I have been with this bank for almost two decades. I have had no "accidental charges" like some banks that I have experience with, eh hem, Wellsfargo. I had some issues with bank tellers in the past, lack of character/personality, but after a few years they started to smile...

The issues that I had in the past is with my visa debit. At first they said it was my magnetic strip, then a few times they sent me new debit cards because of a possible leak of information, each time I understood. I even let the fact go that every time I use my card, I have to swipe it twice for whatever reason...I have ordered and been sent new debit cards plenty of times since the beginning of this year. I understood that life happens...However, when I am in a foreign country and cannot access my money- then I have a problem. I did the whole parodical, notified the bank before going, asking about the surcharges, etc. Then, when it comes down to using my card there is the embarrassing feeling of your card being rejected and the horror that I am a long way from home with no money. I had to call from Spain, they put me on hold several times, even when I stress to them I am being charged for international cards, at the end of the conversation AZ Central tells me it was on the other business end...I go to another business, then another...nothing. I HAD to access my money at this point so therefore, I had to call AZ Central...same response except this time they tell me that the businesses were canceling my purchases. Finally, I relied on my husbands bank for purchases at stores...

Back here in the homeland...I have a server tell me that my card will not go through. Luckily, I was dining with friends and they foot the bill. Here I am, waiting on the phone for twenty plus minutes and they apologize for the inconvenience that their system was down...Really? What century do we live in where you tell your story of $30 dollar charges for international calls, waiting on the line...I am so tired that every time I use my card I silently pray that it will go through...AZ Central does not have surprise charges and are engaging in new technologies that are convenient - They are starting to lack with customer service and after almost two decades I am wondering if I should make a change.An Ode to Walmart: It's Walmart

A senior citizen handing out carts at the door.  My cart doesn't roll straight.  I'm not surprised.  There are no baskets, just carts.  Is that a hint?

It's Walmart.

More babies than a daycare.  More seniors than a senior center.  And tattoos for everyone.

It's Walmart.

Cardboard kingdoms of snacks, a tower of cheese balls bigger than you head for $5.98 each, a wall of ramen labeled "Cup-O-Soup," and a kid putting cheese balls bigger than your head into his family's cart.

It's Walmart.

Fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses.  A crate of $5 DVDs bigger than my bathtub.  The PA announces "All loaders, code 60.  All loaders, code 60."

It's Walmart.

A pharmacy, vision center, credit union, grocery store, hair dresser, automotive section, toy store, bike shop, Home Depot, and Office Depot all under one roof.  I think I got lost twice.

It's Walmart.

Profits measured one penny at a time.  Is Walmart a savior for the poor or does Walmart enable poverty?  Economist can't decide.  Does Walmart help the environment by working with vendors to reduce and remove packaging, and engaging in some environmental friendly projects.  Environmentalists have decided.

It's Walmart.

Self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest.  They've never checked my receipt at the exit.  Is it because I'm white?

It's Walmart.

Patrons leave their carts at the bus stop.  Where did that hour of my life go?So wife and I went there.  I asked for cheese ravioli with non meat sauce.  Plate comes out with meat sauce.  Brought me a second plate started to eat it, and there was meat sauce on it again.  I believe the chef used the same serving spoon for both the meat and non meat sauce.  Which to a vegetarian is a big thing, I told that to the manager.   The manager was very nice and felt very sorry for us.  He ended up not charging us for anything but the glass of wine.  We both got a piece of pie.  

Would probably go again, because my wife liked the pot roast; but I will be very careful what I order.  I don't know how much I trust the chef there.  Mixing serving spoons between meat and non meat items, is not ok IMO.  Mine is a personal choice, but some people eat this way due to other reasons which they consider to be very important.  

Vegetarian check your plates.i love Subway. i really do. usually its fast, healthy, and one of those work lunches that doesnt make you want to curl up under your desk and take a little nap during the afternoon. 

i do not love this particular Subway. they are ridiculously slow. i dont know whether its due to the fact that employee's aren't quite seasoned or if they just dont care. they also have a strange assembly line thing going on. one guy does bread/meat cheese. one guy does some of the veggies and the last guy puts on your 'sauce'. this creates a giant cluster if one of the guys asks you a question that doesnt apply to his section. that means the next guy is going to ask you the same question again or he'll lean over and ask the first guy. well, thats even if the first can remember the sandwich he's making after youve told him for the fourth time.

i can deal with the lack of efficiency and the very distracted sammich makers, but i really wasnt a fan of the cashier who decided to bring up the latest tragedy in Tuscon and give me her whole opinion on the situation. i just stared at her blankly and prayed to the cashier gods that the register wouldnt break. i just want my damn sammich, not a lesson in political leanings. thanks.Eh. Just further proves I really am not a chain type of person. 

Swung in here over the weekend with a friend hoping to score some sheet music (not entire volumes of collections) for the guitar and maybe the piano and have a guitar restrung. 

Store seemed small and cramped and the music selection leaves everything to be desired. It was sad. There were no individual songs and even the amount of books was small also.

On the plus side, everyone was nice, and they did restring the guitar while we grabbed some food. However, I still prefer my small local music stores.Terrible customer service. My wife just got her wisdom teeth and wanted a cold treat to help her feel better. It was A Saturday night so we decided on Bahama bucks since we love it and go to the Mesa one so frequently. We hurried there because it was before 11. Got there five minutes early and hurried to the door as we walked up the manager was shutting off the light I thought well that's odd there are still five minutes till close. So we went in and asked are you closed there's still a couple minutes till 11 (I normally wouldn't do this but it woulda helped my wife out.) He said Yes we are and I said we still have a couple minutes can't you just make us one shaved ice real quick? He argued with me and looked at his watch and said I have 11. All I know is there is probably a reason this kid is managing a Bahama bucks cause his customer service was terrible.Boston bar in PHX!?

Had to check this out!  Was invited here by a friend telling me this place has been in existence since she's been breathing.  That's a long time - wink haha! 

Needless, to say my first impression of the place was -- wow what a poop hole!  However, I've been to worst and I loved it!  I like dive bars, but this place was more sports and please smoke a cigarette bar.  Outdated television sets mixed with some flat screens.  

They had your basic bar menu; burgers, wings, and salads.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries.  Nothing to wow about it except it is what I expected to be.  If you ask me I would stick with the drinks and that's about it.  

They have karaoke during the evenings most every night.  Lots of country and older music I've never heard of and I consider myself pretty old!  Needless to say the singing can improve, but I'm not once to complain.  I appreciate people who have the courage to sing their hearts out in front of a crowd. - Enjoy!Went because it was listed as a place I would receive a free entrée on my birthday. we got there and was told that was the old owner from 3 years ago. They didn't even offer anything for coming in on my birthday. (that was the only reason we went) Wasn't expecting a free entrée but maybe free soft drink. Have to say they not only did not get us as a customer (we got up and left) but the lost the chance to have us repeat one as well. we are new in the area and are still looking for great Sushi. all was well for my birthday dinner went to another place and had a great dinner and will be returning there. Thanks Sushi Kee for letting us move on and find a better place .Food was bland and not very good.  Didnt even have any hot sauce.  Place could use an update on the decor as well...the only redeeming quality is their driving range, otherwise they would only get ONE STAR. it has a bunch of different "targets" to shoot at and is better than just a standard flat range.

other than that, STAY AWAY!!!!

the interior smells absolutely disgusting. the few times i went it smelled the same so it wasnt just some isolated incident like a sewage leak or dead animal.

WORST MINI-GOLF course ever! every hole is flat and as boring as playing in my kitchen. the astroturf is all ripped up and even the cement around the holes is crumbling. 

i commend the yelper below who was able to take one for the team and try their food, something i couldnt even imagine making my ex-gf do. anyways, thats beside the point. on the other hand, maybe he has a screw loose for even attempting the food here. 

i had to go home and take two showers after spending some time here.We've taken the kids to Fiddlesticks a few times and I've been quite underwhelmed.  Each time we've been there a significant number of the inside games are broken (with no "out-of-order" sign) and it's hard to find anyone to get your money back or fix them.  They really could improve their on-site service.  The mini-golf is okay but slow as molasses when it's crowded and could use a little maintenance as it's a bit frayed around the edges.  The carts and water bumbers are standard fare and a little pricey.  The driving range is pretty good though, especially when the grass tee positions are available.I always find what I need but the customer service could be better. It is hard to find anyone to help out with questions. I recently purchased a new computer chair and was looking for someone to help out with getting the box to the front of the store. I had to go to the front of the store to ask for help.  I asked for a cart or a dolly to help me get it to the front of the store. The associate was more than helpful though and carried the box to the front and then out to my car. I just wish it would have been easier to find employees walking around the store ensuring that their customers were alright.We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who, to his credit, was swamped with tables). I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two "managers" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me. 

We didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI-TOWN and chose not to take care of us :) hahaNow I remember why I stopped coming here they charged me $30 more than where I normally go to the same services and service is not that greatI wouldn't be writing about this if I didn't notice that 90% of Panda Expresses do this:

1 employee ratio per 10 customers = a disaster waiting to happen.

Please Please Please employ more people. It is not cool to wait 15 minutes to order, especially when it's fast food. I feel bad for the 1 employee that is supposed to get/make food and ring up 10 customers all at once. By himself. 1 person handling the drive thru alone is just cruel.I freaking love Target. I even get all goofy when I say the name. I bring on the fancy French accent even though I know that's not how you say it people's. 

This Target however, is a freaking let down. As are most places recreated in the older neighborhoods of Glendale. I can't wait to move back to Phoenix just so that I can be nearer a better Target. That's only part of it but it makes a huge difference. 

It seems like I can never find what I'm looking for at this location. I hate that. Target is supposed to have everything. And friendly employees who are right there ready to help you find whatever you need. Help me people. Help me and I will ca your supervisor and tell them what an amazing employee they have. It's science. 

But no. Not here. The employees see you walking around like a chicken with your head cut off and they point and laugh. Not literally or externally but it's like they enjoy seeing you struggle to find something they probably don't carry at this location. Wow. I'm getting frustrated just thinking about it. Grrrr. 

Don't go here. Why do I keep going here? No more. Unless its an emergency. Then maybe. But only if I absolutely have to. Because I hate Wally's more.I went in tonight for a beer and to take some food home. I sat at the bar for literally around 5 minutes (it felt like 15) without being greeted. The bar tender (a white guy with a beard, wearing a hat backwards, and a bit of a beer belly) actually walked by, and noticed, me 3 times as well. After the second time I said to myself, "okay, if he walks by again and doesn't at least say something like, "hey man, I'll be with you in a minute," then I'm out." The third time he actually grabbed a glass from right in front of me, but said nothing. So I rolled out. That seemed like a very clear message that he wasn't interested in my business.

Maybe I'll go back, but a place that hires people that can't be dependable for very simple customer service makes me very weary. If the guy couldn't take 10 seconds to smile and say, "be right with you" can I really trust he's washing his hands after going to the restroom and then making people's drinks? It shows a general lack of concern/respect for the customer. Can't trust it. Especially not when it comes to food and drink.Went on a Friday at noon. Waited in line for 20 minutes to get in. Waited 10 minutes for skates. Waited in line 45 minutes to get a soda at snack bar. Super inefficient place. Dirty, bad area. Really disappointed that the 150+ kids had to sit out for 20 minutes while the 12 weird, creepy adults who are apparently super into skating,  got to skate adults only. Come on, what adults come here in the day to skate?!? Get a job, people!!! So, 150 kids crammed all around our table, falling, hitting each other with their walkers, knocking everything off our table, including the soda i waited 45 minutes for, waiting to go back and skate. So ridiculous! Let the kids skate.  The only reason I gave it two stars was because my daughter was so excited that she got to try out the new skates Santa left her. Won't be going back.Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us. 

The menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people. 

I got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good. 

All in all, meh....Unfortunately, I'm not very interested in returning after dealing with the girl behind the counter. 
Ordered our pizza online and used my husbands card because he was going to pick it up. Well, plans changed and I was the one that ended up going to get it, so I brought his card with me. When I first got there I stood at the front for almost 5 minutes before the girl even realized I was there. She finally came up and I said I ordered a take-out. She asked for the  card used and an ID, I handed her my husbands card, she asked for an  ID again and I responded with my picture is on the card (Wells Fargo bank with a custom picture from our wedding). She said she couldn't accept a card without ID so I pull out my drivers license, getting rather irritated at this point because the girl is being extremely rude. She said she won't accept the card because my ID doesn't match. I said it was my husbands card and it's a joint account, my picture is on it and my last name matches his. Nope, that won't do. So she reverses the payment and I pay with the EXACT SAME CARD but with my name on it. So, now I have 2 charges on my account for the same thing until the other one reverses. 
I just want dominos to know the girl working the counter was BEYOND rude and misinformed. It is actually illegal to refuse a VISA or MasterCard that is signed if the holder doesn't show ID...you can ask to see ID but the cardholder does not have to oblige and the card cannot be refused. I don't think I will be returning.I'm adding another star, because the owner, Howard, has really gone out of his way to make things right. To the point that I'm willing to give them another shot. Hopefully, after that, I'll be able to add more stars.But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.I love Thai food. I can see this restaurant from my apartment window. I probably won't return because I can easily make better Thai food in my kitchen from ingredients procured at the nearby Wal-Mart. People, please, move on.I put in an order through their website for store pickup. At the end of the process it said my order should be ready within 3 hours. 4 1/2 hours later, still no pick up order email. I had to call the store. The operator transferred me to the store manager John (sp?). He was very apologetic about the delay. He said he wasn't sure anyone was scheduled that night to fill orders. He located the items to fill my order. Though I appreciate him willing to do this, I should not have to wait this long or go through a manager just to get my order filled. There should be a disclaimer that orders placed after 3 pm may not get filled until the following day. Will not use this service again. Walmart's site to store shipping may take longer but at least I know I will get my order done, and done in a timely manner. Makes me wonder what would have happened if they hadn't found the items I wanted since they are on the sales floor, not in the back.First time today here. I must say it seems pretty dis organized. The humidor has seen better days. I was looking for two things. One cigars for me, second a gift for a friend. First impression, walk in and two guy chillin on a couch with a big screen TV playing video games. I was greeted, but the guy followed me into the humidor as if I was going steal. there were a large variety of cigars, but the temp was above 70 degrees. A gift set that was open seemed to have been there a while. I was asked what type of cigars did i enjoy, and was suggested a type they carried. I think rather than be parked on the couch, they could have been stocking the empty humdor shelves, rather than them stacked on the floor. I will not be back, some of the prices were higher than that of a high end smoke shop. Sorry Cigar inn, it is the end for me.Went here Friday night for some yummy Indian food, and it was okay.  We ordered 3 dishes for 3 people and 2 orders of the garlic naan bread.  I thought it was fairly overpriced for what we got.  We paid $53 for everything, and they only gave us 1 order of the naan bread.  I remember this place being a lot better than it was.  I have never dined in, but I don't think I would want to.  It had an odd smell, and the tables were pretty dirty for being "clean".My husband and I were out and about in Glendale, and after looking this place up on Yelp and seeing some of the first reviews saying things like "Best Indian food on he west side" and "our favorite Indian restaurant," we decided to give this a try since we both love Indian food. We were not impressed. My dish was just bad-- easily the worst Indian meal that I have ever had in my life. It tasted like there were no seasonings added (or at least not the right seasonings). It was just really really bland and not at all spicy. My husband thought his was okay (but said he would never go back), which is why I am rating this a 2 instead of a 1. The service was great, but the food was bad. I actually ate a few bites, asked for a to-go box, stopped by the store for spices and stuff to make a Masala sauce, and re-cooked my meal. 

The na'an is not like na'an that I have had anywhere else, and not in a good way. Na'an usually has a specific texture and flavor that separates it from other flatbreads. The na'an here was basically a thin pita bread-- very thick, dense, bread-y texture and zero flavor.First, I hate any kind of scamming. This is a bar where a lot of locals know one another. I play a lot of music in the juke box and I've been here to specifically play their great juke box and the fact they carry my beer, MGD 64. The happy hour prices are decent, $2.50 a bottle. The staff is friendly. They have 99 cent sliders on Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise, they don't have any reduced priced appetizers. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, between 5:00-7:00, the bottles are suppose to be $1.75. I've been in here about 10 times.  10 times I was over charged for either food and/or drinks. These were blatent over charges. I had a coupon for 35 cent wings. I ordered 10 wings. Total should be $3.50. It's not difficult to order 10 wings at 35 cents a piece. They charged me $5.75. I brought this up to the bartender and she kept debating with me that 10 wings at 35 cents each were  $5.75.  35 cents x 10= 5.75?  They follow a chart that's taped to their cash register. She kept saying I was the only person in 3 years to ever complain about the pricing of the wings!!! I said then maybe I'm the only person in 3 years to see that you're overcharging everyone. It was eventually fixed after others in the bar started hearing the conversation, but they didn't agree with me that 35cents x 10= 3.50. The last time I went in a couple weeks ago, I specifically went for the $1.75 beers between 5-7. They charged me for full price happy hour even though I was there on the "special 1.75 day". I've had buy 1 get one free coupons for here, and the free meal was never taken off. I've had to correct this many times. So, I like the atmosphere. It's very casual, decent drink specials, really no food specials, and a great juke box. They do have a very small free buffet with 2 things on it, but it's always gone and not re-filled. As long as you watch your bill and prices closely, it's a decent place to go. I would've rated them a 3 1/2  if it weren't for every bill being wrong.I used to go here a lot.. Great beer and food specials during happy hour were not too bad.  Recently though, I have not been happy with the service.  The bartenders have had a attitude when asking for a small change to your order or asking for a beer when my glass was empty.  I can only assume this comes from the management down, which have been unpleasant at best.  Great concept but could be done a lot better with the proper staff.  Not worth the time for me anymore..I feel awkward giving this restrauant the lowest score it's received but I came here based on Yelp! reviews.  The rolls were all specialty rolls so I went crazy and ordered 5 of them. The heart attack roll was weak and the jalepenos were not stuffed at all... The fire and volcano rolls which are supposed to be baked came out cold and tasted extremely bland... And the Mama Mia roll was somewhat decent.

It's a small place and although we got there later in the night I did not expect to be stared at to finish and feel uncomfortable with 10 minutes until close still while they turned all lights off. 

I won't be going back.One of the worst sushi joints I have been a patron of.

Very crowded, noisy, rushed, and the sushi just isn't that good... bland, nothing special, doesn't even look good. No Wow factor here.

on top of that, it's not a cheap spot to go to. $$-$$$ based on your mood. Stay away from Phili rolls here.I was not a fan of their food.  Overpriced for the quality, which was so-so. We got the garlic edamame and sushi rolls.  The sushi was not impressive.  The alcoholic beverages were also so-so, I even ordered liquor in my drink that was not house.  I would recommend finding another place if you are a sushi lover, it may be better for people who want non-sushi.The wife and I moved near this place a couple of years ago and thought this could be our hot spot for BBQ...  Boy were we wrong.

Our first trip we had "ok" service on a weekday and like Jake B. our food seemed to be re-heated from the weekend before.  I had a combo to try out the different options and was less than impressed. 

I even gave them a second shot just in case the first trip was a fluke.  I had the same results when ordering the ribs on our second visit.

I really wish this place was good ....  guess I will have to drive to Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert to get some damn good BBQ.Well I am a diehard Diners drive-ins and dives follower so I had to check out this spot... I will have to say really friendly staff but really slow service... Guy must have been suffering from sleep deprivation from his travels this was not good BBQ... The corn was just gross had to have been boiled in water for hours so over cooked. The chicken was so so and the beef brisket and pretty good pulled pork was ok... I was so disappointed with my experience here  the service was so slow they gave us two free beers it kind of made it a little better but not really will not be going back.Eh - not bad...but not anything to write home about.Not our place. We have gone there 5 times now. Pulled pork was always cold, and dry. And it just never made us leave smiling or full. Give it a try if you will. Their fries are amazing(I believe they are frozen then fried). But yaDelivery is not very good !! Was late and didn't bring plastic wear or plates or not even soy sauce! Very disappointed specially because we have order many times from there before and lately not getting good service.Not impressed. My 29 dollar pizza was not only cold when it showed up, but flavorless as well. At least my toddlers seem to like it...I don't know what Petco these photos are from, but this Petco is pretty lackluster.  Grooming looks like a little hole on the wall and training isn't really present.  

As normal, it smells.  I think it's the ferrets and the fact that they house too many pets per cage.  I've even seen a dead white mouse under a pile of live white mice...like it had been suffocated by the mass.  The employees seem like they are bored and just there for the paycheck.  Saltwater aquariums are a nightmare, and bugs everywhere around the reptile section.  

Not worth the effort really.Poor customer service. Excellent bagels. 
A restaurant shouldn't solely be reviewed on the food they serve alone. That is why I gave Hot Bagels on 59th Ave 2 stars. Although the bagels are amazing, the customer service is very poor. Next time I will send in someone else to purchase a bagel for me.Ok... maybe I was in a "mood' because I don't usually go out to eat mainstream Italian because I think mine is better. But we ordered the Firecracker rolls expecting spicy yummies. YUK! the overwhelming heat masked any of the other flavors. Then, because I wanted something spicy I order the Sausage & Penne pasta expecting little burst of spicy sausage every now and again. Instead, you guessed it, overwhelming heat. It didn't say "Fra Diavolo" so I think my expectations were in line. I really dislike restaurants that don't pay attention to the nuance of flavor. Maybe all the spaghetti and meatballs you can eat is what they're good at? My husband loved his chicken special so that's why I'm giving it two stars plus they didn't charge me for the rolls or pasta that I didn't eat.I went to this cleaners for alteration to a gown. They told me they would alter the hem of the gown for $10-15, which I thought was a great deal because I had just been quoted $30. I left the dress and was told it would be ready by Thursday (I needed it for an event that day). I was called on Wednesday saying the cost was actually about $50, and would not be ready until Friday. I asked for the dress back but the dress was at a different location and they could not have it back to me. My plan was to take it to another location to get hemmed. Given the short amount of time, I ended up having them alter the gown although it was expensive. I ended up wearing a different gown since, although it was ready by Thursday, it was too late and I couldn't pick it up. The manager only gave me a 10%-15%. As good business practice, she should have given me the original price I was quoted.  At the end of it all, I ended up paying more (about $48), and the hem on the gown was done sloppily and the material now has a permanent wave at the base of the dress (probably because if the thread and tension used). It is an expensive and fancy gown, so I was pretty bummed they did a sloppy job. The positive: the two ladies I worked with were nice and professional.Progressive is terrible.  There I said it, now let me tell you how and why I came to that conclusion.  My vehicle was rear ended recently.  Their client was clearly at fault and they advised me they would be liable.  I gave them a chance to repair the vehicle and when the estimate for repairs came back to me, they tried to claim that my trunk deck lid (which was bent from the impact) was like that from the factory.  What???  My car had 4,000 miles on it, and had no defects such as my trunk lid being folded upwards (gee maybe the rear impact did that??)

Anyways, they like to argue self-righteously and have a bunch on young, ignorant, and super-sassy young ladies (?) that work for them at the "service center".  These ladies do not seem like the type to appreciate a nice vehicle.  

So, if you actually want the work done right - take your car to your own shop to be repaired.  Do NOT believe the stuff in the Progressive marketing machine when they say "Drop your car off - and leave the rest to us!".  It's a scam.Lady was nice to my daughter. DVD didn't work, I asked for the Deluxe which is supposed to include a shampoo, haircut and style. She washed and conditioned my daughters hair and cut it like I asked. "Styling" involved her putting a ton of glitter gel in my kid's hair and then turning on the blow dryer for (literally) one minute. I purchased shampoo and conditioner from them and all told I spent $70. We will not be coming back.It's very hard to find staff help when you need it.  When I receive coupons for this place there is a LONG LIST of excluded merchandise that I can't use the coupon.....diapers, formula, bedding, food.......  The prices are also just meh....I can find the stuff cheaper at Target.Today was the 4th or 5th time my wife and I have gone to Arriba's at Arrowhead.  We were excited to find this place because we had lived in Albuquerque for 5 years and had grown to love real New Mexican food and Arriba Mexican Grill is advertised as just that, New Mexican food with real Hatch green chili.  Hatch chili's are so good, they are additive!  I just have to have a chili fix every so often and there's not other New Mexican restaurant around excite this place. 

The first couple of times we went to Arriba's; it was great, really wonderful.  The food was great, the wait staff was attentive and it was the next best thing to real Albuquerque food you could find in all of Phoenix.  Then it seemed like this place started to take a turn for  the worse.  On our third visit, we were promptly seated but guess what - we sat at our table with menus in hand for 20 minutes!  Seriously, there were only about 12 tables with people and at least 6 wait staff but for some reason, we just never got to place an order.  So, we left and on the way out I told the girl at the check out that no one ever came to take our order but she didn't seem to care.  She must have been having a bad day and it would be easy to see why, evidently this restaurant was without any organization what so ever and she was having to put up with unhappy customers.

Well, a few months later, my wife convinced me to to give it another try so we returned and ate the usual stacked enchiladas.  It was OK, but still not as good as that first couple of times we were there.  But today, I am convinced that the Arrowhead store is fast hitting the skids.  

I had my usual enchiladas but something was missing.  As I said before, I go there to get my chili fix and today was as good as any for real Hatch green chili.  Normally, the beefy stacked enchiladas are loaded with chili but I guess the cook was having a bad day today - he / she forgot to put any chili's on the enchiladas.  Not putting chili on my enchiladas is like a sin - I would rather be slapped in the face than have the chili left off my Mexican food.  It's like getting a cheeseburger with no cheese (or meat).  It's that serious!

When the waiter checked on us, I asked if there was a shortage of Hatch chili this year - of course there wasn't (I was being a smart ass) and I told him my food was bland - no bite or heat to it at all.  I told him that the only difference in their food and any of the other 20,000 Mexican food places in Phoenix is this place was supposed to have green chili and my food was not what I expected.  It was just ordinary Mexican food.  

In all fairness, they didn't charge me for my meal and the manager was very nice and said she would talk to the cook about this matter and I believe that she was genuinely sorry.  I will probably go back - it is closer that having to drive to New Mexico but I would suggest that you ask for your chili on the side just to make sure you get your fix.This is my second time here. I thought I'd give em another try. This visit really isn't different than my last one. I ordered a Green Chile cheeseburger. The waiter had to advise me it'll be hot. Lol ok whatever. So I finally get it. The presentation of the food looked half assed. Very sloppy. I take the top portion of bread off... There's hardly any green chile on it. I ask for a side of chile. It shows up. The green chile was hot. Which is good. It tasted straight out of the can tho. Gross. I'm sure they get Hatch food service cans or something. My girlfriends meal wasn't much better. She got The Green Chile Chicken Especial or something to that extent. The presentation of the food was horrid. It was a conglomeration of rice, beans, and cheese. With a little boat of chicken soupy something or other. She said that it was too salty. 

The food isn't New Mexican. It's Tex Mex style food using Hatch Chile.After reading all of the reviews it seemed like a good place to go for the first time, I was not satisfied with my meal nor the appetizer we got. The steak I ordered was mostly fat rather than meat. The service was great however I did not enjoy the food.This "Mexican" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.

The crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.

Their quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.

The chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.

Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping.= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =

It's no wonder this place folded, really.  What we got here on the positive side when I stopped in for lunch with Scott W. was a beautiful dining room, excellent table service and gorgeous platters of food presented in top magazine fashion.

SO, ¿What's not to like? you would ask, if you cared, and if the place was still open.  WELL, the food, in a word, was TASTELESS!!  I've never had such "nothing" bunch of Mexican food, except possibly at a similar fancy looking disaster case Mexican restaurant I tried in Sioux Falls, South Dakota a while back.  Also, the lunch prices were too high.  My order last time was $12.29 without a beverage.  By comparison, I eat at at La Piñata, which is totally nice, the service is great, the food is terrific and they really serve it up for about $11!

SOOOO?  OUT with Chevy's, and hopefully IN with something better...  "Maybe a BUFFET?" Maxwell would say!  Ok, I'D say that too!     :-))When i was a kid toys r us were nice!! This is a dumb!!!!!! Gross old dumb!!I am only reviewing it with 2 stars because my waiter was too busy and I don't think that was his fault.  We showed up and was able to sit right down which is great because when we left there was tons of people waiting.  We had a coupon for joining their mailing list that gave us a free meal with the purchase of another...which is awesome because who eats alone?  They also recently remodeled the interior and it looks pretty good.  My wife ordered the usual broccoli quiche and it was only a little warm.  I usually order the bacon and eggs which is awesome but today I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it was very good.  The food is always great here....when its warm and the service is usually awesome except today, but I wont blame Kevin since he was obviously over-sat.  I hope they get their stuff together because I WILL go back and I know that I WILL be able to write a better review afterward since I have been here 100 times and this was the only poor experience I've ever had.The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it.My first visit to Rock Springs Cafe was pretty good. This is a cute little piece of nostalgia on the highway that would be fun to take out-of-towners to when they come to visit. 

Live music in the saloon, cute little gift shop and baked goods for sale...not too bad. I will say that the honey fried chicken was AWESOME but the cherry crumb pie was okay at best.

For a place that touts itself to have the best pies around, one would think that they wouldn't keep them all in the refrigerator to get all cold and stiff. Myself, I like a room temperature pie that doesn't have a crust that shatters when you try to cut into it....but that's just me.  Also, I think that $18 for a take-home pie is crazy!I've driven by this place numerous times on my journeys north and south.  Today we finally stopped.  Unfortunately, I haven't been missing a whole lot.  

The beer situation was weird.  4 of us ordered beer.  Three of us apparently got the last cold beers.  A waiter handed my friend a can of beer, warned her that it was warm but he brought a frosted glass.  Ummm...  what?!?!  She ordered a different beer.  

Most of the table had received our food while one in our party remained food-less.  It was a good 5 - 7 minutes after we received our food that his was finally brought out.  He ordered the same dish as my husband (Chicken and Biscuits).  My husband's dish was cold.  The tardy dish was clearly given gravy that was left over (most likely) from chicken fried steak.  The chicken tacos were fairly tasty but needed some salsa.

I'm not a pie person so I got a slice of red velvet cake.  Sadly, it was disappointing.  It was dense like red velvet cake should be but it was really dry and the frosting was just barely cream cheesey.  3 in our party that ordered pie were satisfied (I tried all of them and they were indeed, very good).  

My advice: Get a pie...  to go.We saw the TV show on this and took the 40-mile trip for a slice. We were disappointed. As other reviewers have noted, I wish the pie hadn't been cold from the fridge. At least they could have asked if we wanted it warmed up. Also, I've had better pie. In fact, I've made better pie. I believe they use a lot of corn syrup and sugar; anyway, too sweet for my taste. Pie is $4.00 a slice. 

We also had breakfast, and it was OK, but nothing special. Heavy on the grease, bland colors, not appealing to the senses. We spent just under $50 for two people for breakfast and four slices of pie (two there, two to go), which seems steep.

Finally, the service was underwhelming. The only friendly word was on the receipt: Thank you! We were tourists for the day, and I understand that makes us far less worthy than the average local. But still, I think being friendly is part of being in that kind of business, and a smile is free.This place is supposed to be super famous for their pies, even appearing on national television shows and places in Phoenix get the pies imported down. However, I couldn't see why. I've had some great pies and while my banana creme pie was pretty great, it didn't blow my mind or anything. It was banana creme with banana slices topped with a hearty helping of genuine whipped creme. Pretty good. The service was fast, too, though I did order a root beer off the pie menu (supposedly "real" root beer brewed local and from a tap or something) but I'm pretty sure it was just a glass of A&W. No froth or in a beer mug or anything like the description read. 
For two slices of pie and two drinks with tip, bill was $18. That's pretty extravagant for the atmosphere (think Bill Johnson's or any other "cowboy" steak house) and what we got. I felt cheated, to be honest.
Anyway, it was a "been there, done that" sort of thing. No need for a repeat performance.I usually only come here for the Chicken Greek Salad, which is hit or miss if its really good or not.
I love the chips n salsa.
The other night my mom and I went there,decided to get the Mexican food.. HUGE mistake!  I should have known better because I didn't like it before... I like to give 2nd chances.  The beans are disgusting! Rice was cold, taco, not so good.. Very disappointed... I will stick to La Placita in Buckeye when it comes to Mexican food.  They really need tp paint the walls, it's horrible and looks unclean.I like BK, but this one was gross!!!4.00 for a bottle of beer.....ridiculous. Bring back the draft beer!!!!!!! The two stars are for the forever great pizza, just don't find pleasure in eating it there with over priced bottled beer.Summing it up here in the first paragraph...it is like Sizzler only with a Western Theme, and no salad bar.

The service suffers from more mood swings that a patient in the state mental hospital, and the food can be just as random.  I had the shrimp dinner which was served on a bed of cale (kale?) that had more leaves than a rainforest.

Ok, I'm not saying it is bad food, and some of the people there are nice, but Bill Johnsons is just not what it used to be.  This was mediocre fare served up at average prices.  Will I go back?  Sure, when I am bored and cannot figure out what else I am really in the mood for, this is a safe choice.  Is this a place to bring grandma for her 80th birthday?  Well, not for me, but apparently some diners thought so the night I was there.  : )  Wow is all I can say.Best thing about this place was the free glass of wine while we waited the better part of an hour WITH a reservation.  Don't take reservations if you can't keep them.  After such a long wait the food was unremarkable.  May try again just in case the kitchen was having a bad night.Pros.
Food was fast about 2 min. Quarter pounder was cooked to order and very warm. Guy at register understood me and even helped me save a little money with my order but giving me a meal instead of ordering separate that's why I'll give 2 stars instead of one

Cons
Fries were soggy and cold. Ketchup dispenser was so dirty I didn't want to touch it. Mcnuggets were cold and way to crispy. 

I wouldn't normally chose a McDonald's but I needed fast food before I ran back across the street to the hospital to be with my girlfriend. I won't come here again while she's in the hospital.I'm not sure what the deal is with Black Angus, the setting almost tries to present a higher class eating experience, although that fleeting ambience in their eyes justifies their prices.  We went last night, and I've been several times before because this tends to be a go to of the in-law's. 

(and because they were paying :) 

I've never been overly impressed by their food, and even prefer the kischy outback and lone star to them.  The meat tends to be bland and not better than I can get at an $13.95 special steakhouse. the difference is the same smaller cut of meat costs 21.99 at black angus.  The appetizers aren't bad but nothing I haven't seen some derivation of before.  the service wasn't bad, but nothing else really stood out to me, except the high prices.

if they want to treat me to a steak dinner, who am I to refuse, but you won't see me there of my own accord.I go to the B.A. at arrowhead every time the 2 for $39 coupon comes out but this time decided to go to the one in Goodyear. Big mistake. We ordered the Loaded potato skins for our appetizer and when they came we still had not recieved our bread so I asked as she was bringing the appetizer she said it was not ready yet and walked away then I look down at the potato skins and  they were extremely burnt and hard as a rock. Not even a minute later waitress comes by and quickly sets bread down and walks away. Then the manager comes to the table behind us and the lady at the table was complaining that she received shrimp instead of prawns and wanted the meal for free. The manager was trying to talk her into a $1 discount and a remake(can you believe? a frickin dollar) The lady became louder and louder and started cussing because the manager was not bending so this went on for 10 minutes and she starts dropping F bombs. BOOM free meal. So we were subjected to this obnoxious convo for 10 minutes just so he could give her what she asked for all along. Then our meals came. Steak was excellent but onion rings like the appetizer were burnt to a crisp. I do not like confrontation and after seeing what the lady behind me had to do to get action I paid the bill and left. The next day I filed a complaint on their website and within a hour that store manager called apologizing profusely and saying I should have brought it to their immediate attention. So she ends the convo by asking me "did she address my concerns and could she do anything to make me come back... I could not believe she was going to put it on me to ask for a discounted or free meal instead of saying, "this is what I'm going to do for this horrible experience" NO, I have to tell her what to do. so I said nothing because I figured the other lady wanted free and was offered $1 off if they said that to me I would end up cussing her out. It should not be up to me to tell her how I want it resolved. From now on I will go to Longhorn.Packed lines so messy I walk in I walk outI know I said I hate "chain" restaurants...but honestly I really do.  

We were looking for a reverse happy hour and this was close by so we gave in.  The beer was cold, but our food took FOREVER...literally!  Then, they cooked my steak incorrectly...instead medium rare it came out super over done...I asked for a baked potato and got mashed.  I can say that the bartender (we sat at the bar), noticed immediately and sent it back and had it taken off of our bill.  So the two stars is for the food and for the slow service of the kitchen...I'd give more for the attentiveness of the bartender and the manager!We went in a few weeks ago with friends from out of state because we really love the food. It was a super busy Friday evening. We sat in the bar and our server was taking care of a lot of tables so we were ok waiting a little longer than normal to order our first drinks. The issues came in when we had to continue waiting. Then our food got mixed up. Burritos went to one person instead of enchiladas but we were halfway through before we noticed. We just thought the burritos got smaller. 
We mentioned this to our server and she said let me talk to the manager and see what we can do. The manager then came over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained and he said "So what do you want me to do about it?"  Really? He then told us that he looked at us several times while we were eating and we "looked happy". He argued with us for a bit until I told him to leave the table. I think what upset me the most was his attitude and that he acted like we were just trying to get a free meal or something. 
He did end up giving everyone a discount but when he brought the check over he said since you are mad at me here is the number to call and complain. ??? What a baby. 
NO we won't be back. Too bad because the food and service are usually good but I have no desire to deal with him again. Maybe he should go take a course i how to behave like an adult.Manny from modern family was hereThe only reason I am rating this store 2 stars is because I like the salads.  Every single time I go through the drive through they always leave something out or its not even what I ordered. I normally let things roll off my shoulders but it's so incredibly irritating when you pay for something that you never receive because some of us don't have time to stop back through. I think McDonald's has gotten more orders correctly. Won't be returning to this location anymore.Ok all I can ask is why do we keep going to this place. Ever since we built our home in Estrella we have been shopping here. That is about 7 years now and another home. 

No matter what we have special ordered and delivered it has always had to be taken back because they deliver the wrong thing. I think I just told you all I am stupid.I went here for lunch today on a whim. I've driven past this place hundreds of times and finally decided to give it a try. Besides the enviroment (the tacky decorations, the bad music, the plastic silverware and styrafoam plates) that was bad, I can deal with that. I don't really put too much value in it as long as the food is good. Unfortunately, it was not. I ordered at the counter, and paid almost $11 for a combo plate with two tacos, beans and rice with a fountain drink. I felt that was really high, but sat down excited to get my food anyway. 

They give you a plastic tray with some chips and salsa and hot sauce. I thought it was all pretty bland and very forgettable. My food came out really quickly after I sat down. On my personal rating scale for Mexican food, where 1 is Taco Bell and 10 is the street tacos I had in Mexico, this food was about a 3. I'm not talking about "authenticity". I don't care if you want to call it that. It was gross and bland. The taco shells were hard, but not crunchy. They were more chewy, and gave the tacos their prevailing flavor: vegatable oil. The beans were runny and the rice was also really bland. I ended up dumping the taco contents out of the shell and trying to finish it that way. I really wanted to like this place because it is so close to work, so maybe I will try again sometime and order something else. Or maybe not.Went here with Daughter and Grandson last week.  Very mixed feelings about this place.  The zoo infrastructure portion looked tired and unkept, while on the other hand, the aquarium had a lot of new stuff going on.  Prices were very high compared to other parks we have visited.  For the most part, this was a disappointment.  Over $30 per adult and then you even had to purchase ride tickets on top of that.  The value was just not there.  We will not be returning to this place.Despite the multiple signs "getting better and better" it's still a hot mess. This park would need millions to revamp everything where people are excited to go see animals. 
Because it felt like death in there animals looked sad and a lot lonely. And not sure why indoor exhibits smell like crap. All the glass exhibits look like they are not cleaned regularly either

For the price you have to pay...save it to go to a better place like San Diego, until they make improvements fastI don't know what's happening to this place. But I don't like it. The aquarium is boring. And it STINKS to high heaven. Some spots smelled so bad I could barely stand it. Up by the lights in the ceiling, cobwebs. The stingray tank smelled awful. The other area where you could pet sea life stunk. I've been to other aquariums with these features and never experienced this.

Some of the habitats for the animals are SAD. The giraffes....there are no trees for them. They have barely any space. This place is crazy expensive to get into. What are they spending our money on?!

I will make the long drive and go to the Phoenix Zoo next time. This place is sad and I won't be shocked if it's found out this place is being misrun. No more of my money you shall get, subpar and sad zoo!Was craving a steak and seen their advertisement for unlimited shrimp so made the 20 mile drive to the nearest Outback which happens to be in Surprise.

Ordered a blooming onion which was cooked way too long so it was very dark and had a burnt taste. Could not eat it but didn't complain just decided to let it go. Our waiter was never around and left the dishes from the blooming onion stacked on our table through dinner.

I ordered the 8oz Sirloin (first mistake ordering a sirloin steak) and it had a huge piece of gristle through the entire steak so I could only eat about 4 oz of it. I asked for medium and it was cooked well done. 

The one bright spot was the fried shrimp, you can't screw up fried shrimp. Overall we left disappointed that we drove that far for such an unimpressive dinner.Not a fun experience at this IHOP.  What wrecked it for me was bringing my kid there before school to get breakfast and finding out AFTER the food has been delivered that they are not accepting IHOP gift certificate cards because their computer is down and has been down for a month.  REALLY?  Right after the holidays?  I call baloney on this.

The server said "Oh there is a sign in the front that says we aren't taking gift cards..."   Well we looked for the sign and guess what?  It was not on either of the double sets of doors when you walk in.  It was a plain paper sign attached to the cash register.  Now who the hell is looking there when you walk in?  Can somebody say lame??  I can.  LAME!

The food was average.  The service was underwhelming.  Avoid.Pizza was burnt and greasy. Passion bread was okay. Ordered take out hoping for a delicious NY style pizza and was severely disappointed. I won't be back.This particular Starbucks has some very friendly barista's however you're positive experience at getting a tasty cup of you're favorite caffeinated beverage and doing some light reading or surfing Yelp stops there unfortunately.  

They are very inconsistent at making their drinks.  They seem to have different people working each time I visit.  Their is nothing worse than spending TOO MUCH money for a cup of coffee already, let alone have it made wrong with either too much ice, not enough coffee or too much water...  Argue...

Another note, they need to focus more on cleaning their table/chair area for their customers. It was so dirty I could not stay and enjoy my watered down, over iced, not tasty beverage...My husband and I went there for lunch today. Although, we were the first ones there, the service was horrible. The root beer that I got had no carbonation, so I ordered an iced tea which was left empty for what seemed to be an eternity before I got refill. I ordered my burger medium rare and got well done, plus the hamburger was very dry and tasted like saw dust. the clam strip appetizer was a very small amount of clam strips plus they were coated in a heavy batter that tasted like flour. It should be Red Robin..YUK, not yumMeh. I'd prefer the freshness of Olive Garden. Staff was so-so, and the chicken parm I got on Papa's Platter was more like a miniature chicken frisbee. I could barely find the chicken, and when I did, it was hard. Overcooked? Or was it just sitting under a heat lamp for so long?

The atmosphere was just kind of dated, nothing special. I felt like I was in my grandma's basement with all the dim windows, boxes, and fake plants. 

I wouldn't really recommend this place. I just wasn't impressed.Apps are good... but been here for an hour at 6:30 on a Friday (waiting about an hour) and still waiting to get my meal. There are 2 "hostesses" but open seating? But found an open table... that was cleared but not wiped off. Was told they were so busy (with open tables all over) that the kitchen was backed up a half hour. The waitress came over about every 20 minutes. My wife was served a salad with no dressing, and it took about 15 minutes to get some. I would come back... on Wednesday afternoons. Try the fish.ETA 1/2/11****
Went there the day after Christmas for dinner. We were seated right away, however after waiting 11 minutes and not being asked what we want to drink, we bounced.  Found it very ironic that 1/2 of their wait staff was perceived to be screwing around out on the patio....We let their manager know that this was absolutely unacceptable and we don't know when we are going back.  There should be no reason to wait that long for a simple drink order;

We eat here several times a month, so that outta tell you something.  No matter what we order, it's phenomenal.  The steaks are always tender, the ribs are fall off the bone and the salads are the best.  I was going to rate 5 stars, but will only give 4 because a couple of times we have gone there has either been a several HOUR wait time, or they were closed due to unforeseen circumstances.  I would highly recommend Texas Roadhouse for anyone who wants good BBQ.Ive been waiting to write this for a week or so...Id give it 1.5 stars, but they dont have those here on Yelp.

I used to love going to Sweet Tomatoes.  I called it the great upgrade from Souper Salad.   And for a long time it was.. and in some cases, still us.

But let me ask you something.. Why would call yourselves Sweet Tomatoes if you literally had no tomatoes?  We decided to hit this place up because we were trying to eat "healthier."  I know funny, huh?  One could still eat like crap at Sweet Tomatoes. 

So get my plate and begin my salad creation.. romaine lettuce,, mixed with some ceasar and that's when I noticed things missing.  No tomatoes, No cucumbers, No egg..  uhh hello??  These are what makes muy salad good.  So here I am left to enjoy a lettuce and blue cheese salad?  Horrible.

They said they'd give us a  break of $2  of our bill.. Oh thank you very much for your hospitality. we came to enjoy good food, but you didn't have any.  

My final dinner was a small dish of OK pasta along with a half plate of lettuce and blue cheese.  That was sooo worth $10.  (sarcasm).  

My last few trips to Sweet Tomatoes have not been great, so next time someone suggests this for dinner, I'll kindly reply with: "You have a good time, I'll make me a PB&J for dinner."




I hope there's another Souper Salad/Sweet Tomatoes type place out there that would like to open a few locations in Arizona and show these guys how it's really done.This Red Lobster used to be very good. It has gone way downhill over the past 5-7yrs. Back in 2005-2006 the food was very good. I usually would get the Seafood platter, Flounder, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo or  Seaside Shrimp Trio. My wife always got the Crab Liguini Alfredo or Salmon. The last time we went was over a year ago. We thought we would give it another chance. Getting a table is never a problem, as this place is never really packed except on Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. Back in 2005 we would have to wait. We always get the cheesy biscuits and water/beer or soda right away. The cheesy biscuits is still the best thing on their menu.The water tastes like filters sink water, which is horrible. I couldn't even drink it. We got the Lobster Pizza and Lobster-Artichoke-and-Seafood Dip for appetizers.  Pizza was a little dry, but not too bad. The artichoke dip was still good. We got our salad after the appetizer. Why are their salads so watery? It's like they rinse off the lettuce and just drop it into the bowl. Then add the chicken and Caesar dressing. Half the lettuce was soggy or was too wet. Blah!! My wife ordered the Crab Linguini and I got the Seaside Shrimp Trio. The portion size of these meals have shrunk considerably. It seemed like I was missing at least 1/3 of my shrimp that I usually get. Some of the shrimp was tough to chew and not succulent like it should be. My wife did not like the Crab Linguini. Said it tasted funny. The crab may have been frozen or something, but she had eaten it many, many times in the past and it wasn't as good this time. It was bad enough we had to wait well over 30 mins to get our food. Then we had to wait awhile to get our drinks refilled. It just wasn't a good experience. The last 2 times we had been there wasn't much better. We decided to not go to Red Lobster anymore. At least not to any in Arizona. Stay away from this Red Lobster. The food quality has dropped over the past 6 years.I took my mom and sister out for sushi one night. We stopped by this Ah-So location because we were nearby. However, we ended up going to their other location.

They only have two regular tables and all of the others are high stools. I realize the high stools and tables are trendy, but they aren't practical or considerate of all patrons (e.g., for older patrons a high stool is not easy to get on and off). In addition, the two regular tables were near a drafty door and a large sign that had the nightly specials was right against one of the regular tables. Anyway, needless to say we ended up leaving because the atmosphere did not feel welcoming and we wanted to celebrate a family special occasion. 

I'm not sure about the quality of food since we didn't even make it to a table. But their other location was good and accommodating.Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass.First I hate when people call it "Cheesecake" as in, "I am sacrificing a meal tonight and eating at Cheesecake."  Please...

Anyways...
I have pretty good memories of this restaurant from childhood because back then I guess I didn't realize that it was a chain.  When I was a youngster in Michigan, it was always special to go to The Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and wait your 2 hours for a table and la te da.  

Now, I realize that it is just one of the billions of chains on 83rd that is just sub par.   The last time I was there we ate an okay meal but had to wave our waiter down for water refills and earlier in the meal when he was taking our order, he actually sat down next to me while my boyfriend and I were ordering.  BIZARRE!  The guy clearly couldn't read body language.

Food that is just okay

I know you can do better...Really really bad service. Slow, lots of mistakes. I'll do carry out in the future.
Didn't bring out bread until asked twice, brought empty bottle of steak sauce, burger ordered medium well came out red with bun soaked in blood.Extremely noisey, undercooked rice, chicken very salty and dry, just not a good experience! Plus, we had 7 adults and a 1 yr old and they squeezed us all in a booth! Unbelievable! On a positive note, the ice water was very good!Seinfeld fans may remember the "soup Nazi", and this restaurant sometimes reminds me of that episode.  You have to endure a business location that is far, far too small for the amount of traffic that goes through there, the food can take a long time, and it is often inconsistent but sometimes amazingly good.

Their "wraps" are really just handmade pita that is more like Indian Naan bread used as pita, and it is quite good, especially with falafel.The bar is high in Arizona for Mexican cuisine, and Abuelos, you may or may not have a shot in Alaska.

This is a corporate chain, which makes it difficult to execute the details and freshness that makes Mexican my favorite. Always on the search for a good chicken fajita (or lobster, but that's another Yelp entirely) should not be a tall order. Give me limes and guacamole and I'm a happy camper. The chicken here is consistently dry whenever I visit Abuelos and bland. A friend we came with ordered a grilled chicken dish that came out fried, though the menu specified grilled. No bueno, mis amigos.

Check out Los Olivos. It's a few miles away, but the food and the donkey are well worth the journey.I recently went to Abuelos because it was in the middle of where I live and where the people we were meeting live. I was not particularly impressed. The food was bland and was not very good. The salad was awful - it was basically lettuce smothered in cheese and beans and had a weird taste to it. The tortilla chowder also had a strange taste and I could only eat a few bites. The others at my table said their food was just ok - they ordered burritos and fajitas.

The only redeeming thing about going there was the delicious margaritas! I got the Island - with coconut - it was delightful. Otherwise, I would pass.The atmosphere is nice but everything else was subpar.  Guacamole tasted like it came out a bag, even though they claim it's made fresh. It was terrible! GrossFood was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?We had a big lunch and just wanted some appetizers.  I think the menu got a little longer since last time I went to Chili's.  It was a cold night so everyone ordered the Chicken Enchilada Soup.  This soup way too salty for my taste.  Apps were the typical bar food.  The service was really lacking that night.  There are so many nicer restaurants around this area.  I usually enjoy Chili's restaurant, but this one was at the bottom of my list.We went for dinner on a Sunday after arriving to Sedona and thought the restaurant may have nice views. It was basically empty and we were seated on the patio where we could enjoy the fantastic views. The food was good but the menu is pricey and the service was terribly slow in every stage - taking our order, delivering our meals, filling our waters, and presenting the check. The staff was nice but just not generally attentative. 

Next time we are in town, we'll try out some of the other restaurants and pass on this one.Oh I miss my old china a go go on Ann and Decatur. :(  This one is closer to my new apartment and they fall way short.

I called in my order for vegetarian pad thai with extra noodles and a thai tea. When I showed up they were rude and gave me a dirty look when I asked for crunchy noodles. My Pad thai was ok, but not as saucy and delicious as usual and kinda cold. 

 I have always been a steady regular at the other one, but I guess I will have to find a new chinese restaurant. Shame. :(It's not that good, the Lemon Chicken was tough and over cooked. Lemon sauce while it was on the side in the to go order didn't taste like lemon sauce. The shrimp fried rice was pretty plain and the shrimp was low quality and not very much. Good service and reasonable price, but not that good. Might try some noodles and maybe some veggie/tofu items if I ever go back. I wish it was better.I'm very sad to say that I'm giving this course a bad review. I would have listed this as a 1 star but the greens were well kept and the course was in good shape for now (Which would have been enjoyable if we could actually play the course. See below).  Let me first start with the positive, and that is the course was very nicely maintained and looked picturesque.  So there's that. 
Ok, so I'm a local and was invited out with my coworkers to play this course for the first time.  First thing I will say is that the staff sucked. The clubhouse clerk had the demeanor that he didn't give a s**t about anything, which was really off putting to start things off.  The starter clerk and the golf cart clerk were the same. This is a golf course not a Denny's you guys. Step up your manners please.  What ever, just get me on the course and it'll be ok right? Wrong! Let me start by saying that I have never seen a course SO OVERBOOKED in my life! Our tee time was a twilight keep in mind. They were backed up by 3-4 groups every hole. At hole #4 I counted 17 people on one hole! 17!! 4 people on the green, 4 people on the fairway, 4 on the tee box, 2 waiting in cue, then my party of 3. Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE! We finished 9 holes in 3 hours and 45 mins then went back to the club house to file our feedback. When my coworker tried complaining about the overbooking, he was told by the clerk in a condescending manner, "that's why they call it a twilight."  That was enough to send us walking out and never returning. I will never recommend this course to any of my clients or friends. Sorry guys.This casino is a bit ways from where my brother and sister live. So we only went to this casino once only because we went to the mall down the street and came here just so we can wait till traffic dies down. Anyways this casino is a bit small and had the feeling of an old casino not much of the hotel/casinos on the strip. I played a little bit of paigow here but didn't feel a bit comfortable playing their one bit. I wasn't too sure what it was but it just kept me from rating this well.

This casino did have a Kids Quest, but my son said it was small and boring compared to all the others he's been too. So I guess this isn't the place to take your kids if you had a choice.We stay at sunset station hotel, the hotel is very clean, the room is clean, but their is no safe box in the room, and when we went to the pool they didn't have enough chairs. All the chairs were taken. Unfortunately I will not stay here again.(first time and last).Staff is not knowledgable and unapologetic. Please use better training procedures as I waited 20 minutes for them to figure out a printer situation (and even tried to help with mo knowledge of the product) and they were still unable to assist me. Thank you.There is something very unsettling to me about David's Bridal. In essence, it's a farm for formal/bridal wear. Something about all of those dresses being herded together in one place and being pimped out by sales associates who refer to themselves as "bridal consultants"....as hard as they tried, their interactions felt forced and impersonal.

While I find the store itself to border on detestable, the perks of getting your bridesmaids dresses here are: fairly reasonable prices, variety of colors and variety of styles.  The color variety gives the bride the option of staying within her color wheel, or may be helpful in choosing one if she hasn't already. You can also purchase swatches for a dollar which you can use to give to the cake decorator, wedding planner, venue, etc. so they can have them on hand to maintain consistency in planning. 

Dress style variety is helpful as well if the bride is down to let each bridesmaid pick her own dress style that best suits her body type. Our bridal party definitely liked that option. Pricing is relatively easy on the wallet but because of the mass factory production, I will wait to make a judgment on quality.

Like I said, customer service is just.....off. Also, when I returned to order my bridesmaid dress the "consultant" who had "assisted" us on our previous visit didn't put the style number of the dress I planned on ordering into the system. Our original consultant was the one who helped me when I returned to order and when I told her I was there to order she asked me what style I was getting. Um. What? Why should I know that? Isn't it in the system? Maybe it was a miscommunication error, but if I spend an hour trying on dresses and decide I'm going to order one, wouldn't it make sense to put it in the system instead of relying on me to remember what I ordered? That's not my job.  Also, we let them know on the day that we tried the dresses on that we weren't ordering the dresses that day and would be back to order. Again, why wouldn't you enter the style number into the system? So what's the purpose of putting all of our info under the bride's account if you're not going to do anything with it? Good thing I went in to order instead of calling (as the consultant suggested) or else who knows what would've happen. 

I don't even know if I ordered the dress I tried on because the one I thought I had picked was DISCONTINUED. Again, problem could have been avoided if the style number had been saved. Again, why wouldn't you save it?!

I'll be glad when the dress arrives so my dealings with them can come to an end.An update thus far into my wedding gown and bridesmaids gown experience with David's Bridal. Basically this is a downgrade update.

To begin with I did not mind DB's at first and went here as an "option" when I picked out my wedding dress. I just so happened to find my dress here. Therefore my bridesmaids are taking advantage of getting 20% off their dresses and we are coordinating the bridesmaids dresses here. 

After my first appointment, however, everything has gone downhill - fast. I am not going to write out a tangent of 14 paragraphs (which I could), but instead bullet point the continued problems:

1. E-mails to me about arrivals of things such as slips, bras, etc. I am emailed when they arrive, then I call to make the appointment to pick them up and then I am called not once, but twice by the inept sales people here asking me when I am going to pick up. Annoying, inconvenient to me, and ridiculous. 

2. Seeing my personal "consultant" ONCE during the whole time I have picked out my dress, until now. If you're going to give me a personal consultant why aren't my appointments made to be sure she is there?

3. Bridesmaids dresses have been a nightmare. The styles of the dresses my bridesmaids ordered were NOT put into their system. Therefore when my bridesmaids went back in to actually ORDER the dresses, they had no idea which ones they needed/wanted! Also, one bridesmaid ordered a dress, and it was wrinkly as F&^% when she got it. I get it, sometimes things get wrinkly, but really?

4. All of my interactions with the people here (minus my "consultant" the FIRST time I went) have been forced and impersonal. 

5. When I went in to pick up my dress the lady who was helping me seemed incredibly irritated I had forgotten to bring my own slip and bra. Um, sorry lady but I have a lot of shit going on. See the ring on my finger? I'm a BRIDE and I have BRIDE SHIT TO DO. Not to go all "bridezilla" but giving me grief over such a mundane issue should not happen.

Overall I gotta say DB's is not so good and I would probably recommended going somewhere else for your bridal needs. But now I'm stuck with them and I can't wait to be done with them.Sorry Romano's Macaroni Grill but it seems that your quality of food has gone down quite a bit since the last time I ate there. While the staff is is pleasant, the food is sub-par at best. I remember how a couple of years ago, I used to love going here. What happened RMG? Did the economy force you to take shortcuts with food prep? Or did it cause you to switch to using lower quality ingredients? 

Regardless, our experience was decent in terms of service but food was bland and boring. The fried macaroni bites had no flavor to them what so ever but do admit the fried sole was awesome. Overall though, I think RMG went the way of Olive Garden in terms of Italian food.My friend and I used to come here after class to grab a quick lunch to eat. Anyways the lunch menu is around $8-12 depending what choices you get.  The portions were good enough but it was short of amazing.  Personally, I liked the pasta it was descent.  I wouldnt mind going back here again, I thought. 

We came back again to RMG again during lunch and came back to a horrible experience.  We were seated near the bar area and it took like 15minutes for someone to finally realize we were there and when the server took our orders. It was about 25-30minutes till we got our food and it was cold when it arrived.  We ended up not finishing the food and waited for the server to come back.

He asked how everything was and we let him know that the food was cold and the service was not great.  He comped our meal and we left.  From then, I knew I wouldnt come back here again.  

However, about a week ago I went back to have lunch there again since it has been almost a year since I havent gone back to RMG and it finally concluded the fact why I wouldnt want to come back here again. 

The complimentary bread was hard and not tasteful.  We ordered the $2 entrees for $25 ( two appetizers and two entrees) we ordered the mac & cheese bites some other appetizer. Both appetizers tasted bland and it seemed like it was just microwaved.  The entrees were average, its only good if youre hungry but other than that, go somewhere else to fill your appetite for italian food.I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. 

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.

 
First, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.

Second, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.

Hey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!

Finally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.

I wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate.I used to enjoy the store because they had the best newsstand in the area. I don't know what happened but that is no longer the case. There are a lot of empty spaces and the magazines that are there are out of order. The newsstand is practically unshoppable. It's sad when I can go across the street to Target and get a better selection and more up to date selection of magazines. 

In addition to the poor state of the newsstand they no longer carry music and DVDs. It is also difficult to locate new book releases. You are better off going around the corner to Barnes & Noble.Realized on my 2nd visit the irony that name is "hand wash", but they have the assembly line looking washers - definitely not even hand washed! It is dried and detailed (sloppily) by hand. They do seem to wash by hand a little since the guy did get out what I thought was permanent black rubber mark on my door. 
My groupon is done now, so I wont be back again.I happen to just love bookstores and libraries ... so it's pretty hard to tick me off enough for me to leave a Barnes and Noble store angry. But this location accomplished this rare fete Three Times. First, I had to interrupt two workers discussing what time they were going to take their break. They glared at me with their hands on the hip stance and snapped at me. Then they would not give me full price for my return and third when I made a purchase and had $2.30 left on the gift card, they would not give me cash back -- only if it is 99 cents or less. Whatever. The only reason I gave this lousy rude location two stars is because the guy at the cafe took extra care to get my coffee order correct. Thank you for that. 

Go to Amazon.com for your books and if you want to browse through some check out our local libraries. They are great and we are already paid for the books with our tax dollars.This store is small and doesn't carry alot of items for women or men. It's a waste of time for me everytime.Pros: I got a very 1 bedroom for a cheap price, easy and free parking, wifi works well. Friday's and Joes Crab shack are walking distance.

Cons: Haven't slept hardy at all since checking in. Constant footfalls from the upstairs rooms, constant planes flying overhead at this hotel is directly in the flight pattern of McCarrens. Elevator is loud. There is a smoke detector directly above your head in the bed and is VERY bright at night. Cannot change rooms was told place was booked. I'm sure there are better rooms here but who knows. Pool is ok but hot tub was way to cold. Wife said staff was rude but they have been ok for me.The course was in horrible shape and the employees were rude and unresponsive. The practice facility is relatively nice though.I don't know what happened to this place this time but they were not doing a good job with anything that night. It was Halloween and we arrived about 7. We waited about 5 minutes..maybe longer at the hostess stand with no one in sight. We almost left and went to Applebee's. I wish we would have. Finally get seated and there we sit for another 5-10min before they bring us water. The place was empty. We told her we knew what we wanted before she took off again..and we have a todler so we are always close to a temper tantrum. The food arrived and I had ribs w/mashed & corn,  hubby had  steak & baked potato. My ribs were not very good at all. There was not enough sauce so I waited for our server to come back and check on us and she never did. Hubby had to go and find someone. When the sauce came out it was boiling hot. Very weird. Hubby said steak was ok..not as good as it usually is.  We also had to wait forever for the check. I hope they were having an off night..cuz it will be awhile until I try here again. Which sucks cuz I usually love this location.I absolutely *used* to love this place. It had such a large and eclectic selection for super low prices compared to every other thrift store around, but since their renovation several months ago, prices have been seriously jacked up ($1 T-Shirts are now priced at $4.99! $7 Golden Girls throwbacks are now $14! ~ Blanche? Something is amiss...~) and all the merchandise looks like bland, generic stuff you can get at the dollar store or a yard sale for cheaper. This place used to be my thrift store go-to, but at these prices and the change in the type of merch they place on the floor, it's only "meh" now.  I guess I'll have to get my second hand fix at the Goodwill on Eastern - and deal with that parking nightmare... Gah!My manicure chipped after 2 days, not sure how the pedicures areI walked into this location wearing a parka and was absolutely freezing.  The thermostat at the counter read 63 when I went to place my order.  My husband and I asked the employee if there was any way they could raise it a few degrees - I saw other people in the dining room with their jackets and hats still on.  The woman said "it's not up to us, corporate does it."  

On another note, our fries were cold.  Maybe that's just because the place itself was freezing.  

Won't be back.First off, I want to say that they do not lie about being in and out within a hour. They dont hassle you like other dealers in town. Just know there is no room for negotiation. The price is set. Our sales guy was very nice. The only reason I give this a two star is because they did not properly do a thorough inspection. After we took the car for a test drive, I noticed that the break, radiator and windshield fluid were low. When I told the Kurt, our sales guy that it was low he said that it was because the car needs to be running. When we brought the car home we did a more thorough inspection of the car and found that they did not change the air filter and cabin filter. It was really dirty. Other things that they did not do was top off the gas and remove the tree sap that was all over the car. Dont get me wrong, I love the 2010 Subaru Outback that I purchased from them, but they couldve done minor things to make this more pleasant.

I called the service department at the dealership after the inspection and they wanted us to take it in. Since they were on the other town and they dont really do anything special for you when you buy the car, it wouldve been a waste of time and extra money out of my pocket to fill up my tank. 

Overall, they get a two star for the lack of service I believe they place on cars that they put on that lot. At least, that is what I found when I purchased the car.

One more thing is that the sticker that they place on the windshield that tells you when the next oil change is up was not updated. I called them and they advised that it was changed, but not updated. Not a big deal, but get it right next time guys. They also added tons of miles on the car while they had it. They had the contract at 23,582, but we actually got it with 23,780. Someone must've been taking it for a ride before it got placed on the lot. I don't know if it makes a difference but we shouldve had them update the contracts with the correct mileage. Wonder if it wouldve changed the price a little. OH WELL. Lesson learned.I had the traditional corned beef on rye (whole) and my son had a tuna melt. He enjoyed his sandwich which was served open face and smothered with cheese. Both entrees were huge and should have been shared. My sandwich was dry and tasteless. Anticipating this possibility I ordered a side of slaw. Sometimes a great cole slaw can really help a dry corned beef sandwich and elevate it to an outstanding meal. Not the case at Weiss's. Their slaw was absolutely tasteless too - basically watered down mayonaise as the dressing - and horrible mayo at that. Very disappointing. 

We had high hopes as we wanted to try a non-strip deli (beyond Canters and Carnegie) and hoping for a great find. I was disappointed. The prices are lower than on the strip, so I didn't feel absolutely ripped off.Food took a while it was at night I was looking at apartments on that street all the way up the street but this is the only McDonalds in the vicinity and there's no other real restaurant in for a mile or two going up to HendersonRoaming the streets, we struck out on the first three places we tried to visit for dinner. Establishments we found on Yelp were all closed for good. A sign caught my eye, with lights shining through the windows, Napoli Pizza! My co-workers go to the one by work all the time and rave about it. This one had to be good too, right?

We walked inside, and started looking at the menu. Deciding on what we wanted, we started to order. The cashier took my order easily, yet when my wife asked what was on her pizza, the lady had to look at the menu, then ask someone else. This may have been because she was new, who knows. We won't knock that too much.

There were a couple staff members just sitting by the counter while their compatriots were busy with customers. There were two tables already eating, as well as a few phone orders that were coming in while we were there. It did not look crazy busy though, just a nice steady flow of business.

We paid, received our drinks, sat down and continued our conversation from earlier.

10-15 minutes later, my pizza came out. Not a strange occurrence,  as between the pizza and little stand, the staff member's hands were quite full.

I was halfway through a large pizza before another staff member came near us, she made the effort for customer service to offhandedly ask how everything was. She was lucky to have asked without fully looking at our table, as the rage in my wife's eyes would have burned a searing memory into the girl's soul, and my wife replied, "know where my pizza is?" or something along those lines. Of course, the immediate answer was, "oh it should be coming out in just a few minutes. This was already a good ten+ minutes since I had my food.

It was almost 45 minutes (total) before they got her pizza out!!!1! They forgot to make one of the two pizzas on our order. As I said, they were steady busy, but busier screwing around (appeared that way anyhow) than making sure orders went out right.

The pizza tasted alright, maybe it would have been better if the bitter taste of rage did not creep into our minds. 

We may give another Napoli a chance again, but this one is on our avoid list.How long has it been since you tried to get gas somewhere that doesn't have the option to pay at the pump?  
Not only are they living in the stone age with gas station technology- the line was long, and no wonder. 
We wanted to fill the tank of our rental car.  We had to guess at the amount. If we guessed too much it meant another wait in line. Too little means we left with a tank not full.  Since you can't take a rental car back like that, we ended up stopping at another gas station to finish the job.
What a waste of time.
The clerk was pleasant- but she must get constantly hounded by those who aren't frequent customers.
One has to wonder why Chevron allows their name to be muddied by an outlet too cheap to upgrade their technology.The place has gone downhill. Smaller everything and higher prices. Service was prompt and friendly. 
We came in on Saturday morning. Years ago you would have to wait to be seated, today we walked right in. Go next door to Babystacks.So my sister, brother, and I ordered Enzo's for delivery last night, and I've been going to Enzo's since high school, however, last night was truly disappointing. First of all the lady was so rude to my sis on the phone, to the point where she was almost like screw the order! 

They totally screwed up our order, and seemed to do a half-ass job on our pizza, not taking the time to spread the toppings out evenly (see pics) they didn't cut the slices even close to even, and just kind of threw everything together!

I was utterly disappointed especially for how much money it cost!

You expect a little more for the mom and pops joints and want to give them the business over the big conglomerates, but like my sis said, never again! 

Service and attention to detail go along way and this was just sad!!!The food is actually pretty good here. I would give the place 3.5-4 stars on the food alone.  However, I gave it 2 stars because the service is downright horrible.  I mostly order delivery and whenever I call they seem pissed that I'm calling. This could be a great place if they would improve the customer service.I used to frequent this place 7 years ago and it was the best authentic Thai food ever.  

Now after returning to town after 7 years I tried the pad thai, finger egg rolls, soup and Thai tea.   The pad thai is soggy and too sweet.  The Thai tea was a little more watered down than most and the egg rolls are much smaller.   The soup was way too salty.  The atmosphere has changed and everything has more of a Hawaiian feel.   

I love Vegas and wish I never left,  it breaks my heart to see all of my favorite places fall apart.


I read a review from a critic that said the kitchen works magic.  
In guessing the trick was that the chef disappeared or this magic show is dark on Sundays.I received an arrangement of tulips in a vase as a gift. I have to say the tulips looked half dead. There were actually brown marks all over the tulips. They were surrounded by a bunch of otehr flowers that were supposed to be white, but were also brown. I feel terrible for the person who spent so much money to send me the flowers when they were obviously well past their prime. Not impressed.I'm always a bit disappointed with the service at Macy's.  One day the dressing room was a TOTAL mess, to the point that I felt like I should probably point it out to someone.  I couldn't even get into two of the rooms, not because the stalls were occupied, but because there were so many clothes on the floor that you couldn't move the door.  When I told the woman at the register about the chaotic fitting room situation, she was completely exasperated and told me she was the ONLY PERSON working in the clothing section that day.  Really?  How does that even happen at a major retailer like Macy's?  Hey, if you need to hire more people, there are plenty of unemployed people in this city who'd be willing to help.  Don't penalize your customers.

The sales can be really incredible at Macy's.  That's why I keep going back.  That's the ONLY REASON I keep going back.  The service is terrible at this location.I hate shopping at Walmart but it's one of the few places I can afford.It just isn't as good as it used to be. Even using a coupon, the quality of the beef and bun were just sub-par. I won't be wanting to go again for a long time, if ever.Terrible service! This location is at the mall and is way too busy and unorganized. The waitress never brought our fries. Hello? This is what Red Robin advertises! She also brought us our food but did not bring silverware. It was a bit disappointing.We've been eating at this location on and off for a number of  years and lately, it has been less and less often because of the problems with service. We ate here yesterday, ironically using a gift card given to us a few months back by the manager due to horrible service that time. It doesn't seem to be any one thing that goes wrong - there is a just a general sense of this restaurant never being organized. If the service is speedy, the kitchen is slow. If the kitchen is fast, the food runners let food sit in the window. Or some combo thereof. The food is decent for a chain burger joint and we like the flexibility of the veggie burgers since we don't eat meat. However, Red Robin isn't the only place we can get a veggie burger. I really wish this restaurant could get everything together!About 6 years ago, I tried this restaurant and was impressed with the food quality and affordable prices. Back then, you could order a rib eye , or filet  mignon for about $10-$15 cheaper than you could on the strip.

 Like many hardworking people here in Las Vegas, the economy has forced me to order # 1's at McDonald's now instead of eating at high-end steak houses. 

I was so happy when I saw this place advertising a prime rib dinner special for $12.99.  After calling to confirm the special price,  we made reservations and even got dressed up for the occasion. 

We ordered 3 prime rib specials ( 2 medium, and 1 medium well). They all came out underdone and almost cold in the center. Are you kidding me? Medium and medium well to me is not blood rare (almost blue). My wife sent hers back, while I chose to eat around the outside of my prime rib. 

However, not everything was disgusting as the prime rib specials. The chopped salad was a nice appetizer with a perfect blend of cheese, bacon, and dressing. The best side dish was the sonoma potatoes which were fried and sauteed with onions. 

To their credit, they ended up not charging us for 2 of the prime rib dinners. Good thing they did, or this would have been a 1 star rating. 

I am so disappointed! Oh well, back to McDonald's.Service sucks.  Not follow up or communication.  Spent almost 3.5 hours waiting for a New Car Purchase  3 month/3000 mile check up.I've had worse, but seen WAY better.

My First visit - simple, basic 5,000 interval service (oil change, rotation safety check etc) - check in and waited 2 hours, was called to check out only to see they serviced the wrong car.... not only had my car NOT been serviced yet, but they performed the services I needed on someone else's car.  - the service manager apologized and we rescheduled (I was new to the area and didnt know of any reputable mechanics and I was still covered for free maintenance at the dealership).

Second Visit - went better than the first, while they were doing the work on my car, I decided to buy a new truck - done deal.

Third Visit - 5,000 mile service on new truck - waited two hours for an oil change and tire rotation - absolutely uncalled for!  Service was great by my pet monkey could have done it faster - but it was included at no charge

Fourth Visit - 10,000 mile service on new truck - pulled in to check it in, was advised it was another 2+ hour waiting time. I expressed my growing concern with the advisor and drove off.  I spent $100 elsewhere for the service and was on my way in 30 minutes.

I only have 2 more interval-based visits left on my Toyota Care maintenance plan.  Although the people are nice, the place is an absolute waste of valuable time.  Great place to buy a vehicle from, avoid the service department at most costs!First dealer experience and I was sold a toyota tacoma that was certified with no proof and a fake car fax report when the vehicle had clearly been in some kind of front end damage.  Also it had a broken driver window switch that was supposed to be replaced as GUARANTEED and stool this day hasn't been repaired.

They think you have a week to leave a car there for repair when you just bought it "certified" lol. What a joke!

Damn check engine light came on after two years causing me smog headaches. Point, I doubt they do anything at all to do much other that put this certified sticker on your car to charge you more money like car max.We usually love to come here for a tasty low key family meal. We have not been in in a few weeks and are sadly surprised with both the menu changes and flavor of our favorite dishes.
My Dandan noodles were oddly tasteless and had none of the usual spice to them. The Mongolian beef, chicken teriyaki and lettuce wraps were equally disappointing. 
The chicken in the teriyaki bowl resembled the flavor Mc Donalds nuggets with some sauce dumped on it.
The Mongolian beef was overly sweet and the sauces for both the dandan noodles and lettuce wraps almost tasted watered down. 
Please bring back the flavors we love.Unfortunately, my experience at Bangkok 9 was mediocre at best. I had the Pad Thai and Kra Pow Chicken. The pad thai was a bright orange, as if it was drowned in food coloring, with little flavor and rubbery chicken. It also came with only 2 shrimp which was a major disappointment. I ended up adding my own sauces and seasonings before finally eating it. As for the Kra Pow chicken, the chicken looked stale, however, it did not taste as bad as it looked.
this was not my first time at Bangkok 9, and had pleasant experiences in the past. However, with this latest experience, i do not think I will be back there ever again.We have gone here a few times. 

My gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads. 

Service is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???

And something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks???? 

In the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                    

The pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there.. 

The funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed! 
I guess people love a so so place.

I dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!! 

I'm just sayin,,,,This Comfort Inn is just a place to lay your head for a night's sleep in North Las Vegas. Located along a busy thoroughfare, it is especially difficult in the morning commute hours to make a left on Cheyenne Avenue to go east toward the freeway. The Inn is clean and simple. The room air conditioners are exceptionally noisy. The complimentary breakfast is the same at all the Comfort Inns: cold cereal, instant oatmeal, fruit, breads (all white), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juices and coffee/tea.Tiny, smoke-filled casino in a trashy part of town. Security was a bit on the rude side: asked to see my ID upon entry, and when I asked why he growled at me that I looked like a teenager. Uh, get your eyes checked.

Only went for the restaurant, as my BF has fond memories of their ultra low-price specials. We both opted for the steak and eggs, which also comes with your choice of hashbrowns (for me) or homefries (for him), and bread (which neither of us got). My guy added a stack of pancakes.
Steaks and eggs were properly cooked to order but nothing was seasoned- reminded me of dining at a hospital. Luckily they have a giant basket of condiments at each table, including steak sauce, tabasco, Cholula, and S&P, nearly all of which we made use of.
Pancakes were okay- a bit on the thin side but well-sized, served with single-serving cups of Log Cabin syrup rather than a bottle or a warmed portion in a cup.

Staff was okay, server seemed exhausted so I guess she'd been working all night. One of the male kitchen staff kept coming out to the dining area like clockwork every five minutes, rearranging the tables and chairs at random. Very odd.

BF is really upset that I didn't like this place more. It wasn't problematic, and the prices are good, but not worth the drive for food I can easily make better on my own for the same price. Good for late-night post-drinks dining though, I'm sure.An Ok Mexican Restaurant SLOW Service. Food not as authentic as hoped for.Rude service and mediocre food!I wanted to like this place. The girls are more "North Las Vegas" looking than "Vegas" looking, But that's not the problem I had with this place. Minus one star.  
Secondly, the the music sucked. Bad. The dj talks thru the songs and it seems the girls couldn't get a good full dance without all the dj interruptions. That's why I took off another star.
Main reason I gave this place only two stars...
We came in at sat at the bar. Ordered a house whiskey and diet for my friend(mesured shot) and a draft 12oz. Dos XX for myself. $16. Eh. It's a strip club. It's Vegas. But come on now. :/
So we sat there drinking our drinks and the bartender kept hounding us if we want another round. We were only a few sips in. Every 3 to 5 minutes asking us if we're ready for another round. Mind you, we were the only people sitting at the bar, cause all the couches were full of patrons. I can see why now no one was sitting at the bar. After watching the action for about fifteen minutes or so the bartender took my beer, which was about gone, maybe 1/4 left. And poured it out and the asked me if I wanted another one. I then told him that I wasn't finished with the one he took. And with a big attitude, poured a shot of bud light back in my same glass and plopped it down inf ront of me. What a douche bag. 
My friend, she was drinking her drinks. I was driving. I just wanted the one beer. It's not like we were taking up space at the bar. 
Since the friend I was with was way prettier then the dancers, they didn't hound us for lap dances. But I was putting tips in the G Strings. We were spending money. 
Mind you, this place is opposite of high end. It's a Mexican strip club. Matter of fact, I've been to better strip clubs in Mexico. I don't blame the girls on this one. It was the crappy employees and the dj set. I wasn't expecting much, from this lil shack in the bad part of town but someone needs to explain to the management about "YELP" and the customers who post on it. 
Would I go back? I'll give it another shot. I'll just drink first before I go. Oh and they frisk you when you come in, which gave me a false sense of security.Once upon a time I enjoyed coming to this place to watch movies, hang with friends at the lounge watching Love Shack perform, and enjoying a drink or two at the casino bars.  That was when Seinfeld & Friends were dominating the ratings on TV.  

I recently visited the property and it's lost it's fun atmosphere and energy.  The crowd has changed a lot since those glory days and the casino is just depressingly empty.  It didn't make me want to stay and hangout....at least I have some great memories from the good times.  Maybe it will get better when the economy rebounds?

Return Factor - 5%The interior looks like Boulder Station, but with a different floor plan.  I had some Mexican dude asking me for a dollar as I was leaving.  Crappy!Roaches and porn!!! 

Well it's not my usual type of hotel tht I would stay in, this looks old and smells like smoke as soon as you walk in the casino.  We're only here for the fight, otherwise I'd be near or on the strip.

Ok so first off, we wanted two queens cuz our daughter is with us and a king is just a little cramped, but they couldn't help us.  Then, the room smelled musty and the ac didn't work correctly.  Then I was flipping channels and 3 of them had porn on them, luckily my daughter had her head buried in her Itouch.  We told the front desk and they said that they'll run for 24 hrs after the person ordered them. I think hotels should be able to shut them off as soon as the person checks out. What if my daughter had been paying attention?? That is unacceptable!!!  Then to top it off, I was in bed and looked down to turn the lamp off and saw a roach staring at me. Tht was it!! It turns out that it was only a grasshopper but that's still creepy!! They told us they were completely sold out but then they ended up moving us to a larger room!!!  

On a positive note I do have to say that the staff is extremely nice, in the entire hotel and casino!!The buffett kept me thinking of the movie, Super-size Me, because everything was so salty, deep fried, or swimming in gravy; Although I must give Texas Station kudos for serving Menudo; again the Menudo was way too salty. I ended up skipping the buffett and settling for the Grand Cafe where I had omlets. My room made me think of what a half-way house must be like. Do not expect pillow-top mattresses or chocolates. I had to call the front desk three days in a row before the plumber showed up with a bottle of Draino-O to unclog the face bowl drain! I would have checked out after day one but I was attending a class nearby and my room was pre-booked. There was a dog obedience conference held at the hotel while I was there. Some of my classmates complained of dogs barking and crying all night!  What ever you do, I suggest not considering this place for a honeymoon otherwise you may end-up getting annulled in the morning-enuff said :-(I came here due to needin a new better litter box. Right before here I went to PetSmart just to compare prices OMG this petco is DOUBLE prices for same exact litter boxes other store offers. I find that insane. 

Other then that.... It's a nice store, people are friendly- enough. But definitely will price compare before buying from here!!Their sandwiches just miss.

The pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless.

I have had better at other Capriotti's and certainly at other sandwich shops.Gaetano's has been known as one of the best Italian places in Henderson for some time now but I'd have to disagree.  

Décor
Gaetano's décor is intimate and dark with some nice music lightly playing in the background. I loved the ambience and believe it is the perfect setting to grab a bottle of wine and bring a date or just catch up with some old friends. That I liked.

Service
Our server was very informative and polite, however outside of that the service was subpar.  We had to constantly request basic things like a spoon for soup, a refill on drinks, or make an attempt to flag the server down to ask for bread and to place our meal orders. For a place at this price point I expected some type of attentive service and wasn't even greeted with mediocre service. Considering that the restaurant only had about 15 people in it, it's unclear as to why service was so poor.

It was also interesting to read how other Yelpers commented on the owner visiting the tables and introducing himself. Strangely, we watched as he went to every table but ours. Perhaps we weren't dressed appropriately, perhaps he didn't see us (despite there being only about 6 parties in the entire dining room) or perhaps he just didn't like us. Either way I would have to say that him snubbing us for whatever his reason was unprofessional and unfortunate.

Food
We had the calamari, the stuffed salmon, mushroom soup and the cioppini. Honestly, there's nothing to rave about here, I can't even really say it was "meh", basic meals with nothing that exceptionally stood out. The mushroom had a variety of mushrooms blended with a bit of truffle oil in the middle. It was interesting and you could taste the variety of mushrooms in the soup, which was nice.  But outside of that I have had better calamari at Buon Gusto, better cioppini at the Oyster Bar at Southpoint and way better salmon at Off the Strip and Panevino. How is this the best Italian in Las Vegas? It's not even top 5. Maybe they were having an off day but I have no idea why people think this place is the best Italian place in the city.

Bottom Line: Is Gaetano's the best Italian in Las Vegas? No. They're not even the best restaurant on their block. I would much rather travel the extra 30 seconds to Buon Gusto on Eastern and Horizon Ridge Parkway or Montesano's a couple minutes  down by St. Rose and have a better experience and meal.I bought a Groupon to Gaetano's. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night around 7 and the restaurant was about half empty. 

First thing, service was slow. We had a reservation, and we were seated immediately, but we had been sitting awhile before our drink orders were taken. And then when they were, it took awhile for them to get to the table and for our waiter to come back to get our appetizer order.

We got our appetizers fairly quickly. However, there were 35+ minutes between the time we finished our apps and received our main course. During this time I think a busser came over to refill our water, but otherwise didn't see our waiter. I had ordered the gnocchi, which was okay but on the bland side, and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna, which came out cold. 

My boyfriend had to work later that evening, and we thought we allowed ourselves plenty of time, but by the time the food came out, we were crunched for time, so we just quickly ate some of our food, boxed up the rest, and left. I wouldn't go back, especially paying full price.The ONLY reason this location gets 2 stars is because I love Chipotle.  

The ONLY reason I come to this location is because it's the closest one to my house.

Typical Chipotle assembly line of workers and food.  The service is horrible and they don't put much food in the bowls. I don't know how many times tonight I had to say "Corn, Sour Cream, Cheese, Guac and lettuce" Needless to say, after the worker put the to go lid on my bowl, I had to then tell her AGAIN she didn't put the cheese on.  Every single time I come to this location, I have to say at least twice "extra this, extra that" because they always put less than a spoonful in the bowl. Who knows, maybe at the other Chipotle's I've been to they're just generous. 

I understand that it's fast food, and I understand they need to get people in and out as quickly as possible, however I don't see a need for that considering every time I'm there, it's EMPTY.As far as Chipotle overall goes, 2 of these stars go simply towards that.  Taste of food +1, service overall -1 (yes, it's that bad).  If this wasn't the closest one to my house I would definitely stop going.

They have screwed up my order more times than gotten it right -- and this is from ordering online, where they have a physical piece of paper directing them what to put into it.  Several times I've ordered online and come to the restaurant at the pick-up time given on the site and come to find out they haven't even MADE my order yet.  Not terrible since it's fresh but why bother putting a pick-up time?  They weren't even busy either.

I think this location just has a lot of lazy employees.  Food quality is still good in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants, but perhaps speaking slowly and clearly would be ideal when placing an order.

If ordering online, it's a mixed bag.  Sorry.I only came here once and refuse to go back. Upon first entering the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that Blue Moon wasn't an available beer option. Since being to other Chipotle restaurants in Vegas I'm guessing it's a Vegas thing, as they used to have Blue Moon at my usual Chipotle in CA. I opted for a different beer and ordered a steak burrito. The steak was so chewy and full of fat it was difficult to eat, let alone enjoy. My friends ordered shredded beef, which they said was good. It's possible that I showed up on an off-day or something but it was enough to turn me off from this location.I was referred here by my regular doctor. I found the office staff to be friendly but there was quite a bit of paperwork to fill out. I only gave 2 stars because this doctor was just OK. He seemed a bit akward, to the point that it even made me feel a little uncomfortable or uneasy. He didn't take much time with me and didn't really offer much advice. Just gave me a trial pill and sent me on my way. Not the worst doctor in town, but I'm sure there's better.The only reason why i give this place a 2 star is because of their iced chai latte I had a few weeks ago. The barista was using Da Vinci Chai Syrup in my chai latte! Isn't this a coffee & tea shop?! You should either be steeping your own chai tea then add milk & sugar + ice OR use a higher quality chai concentrate like the Tazo products. As a business owner, Da Vinci syrups are one of the cheapest products you can buy compared to Torani or Ghirardelli products. Hmm using low quality products and yet charging high prices.... Meh! I've definitely experienced better!I usually order a la carte, and my guy gets all you can eat. I do not like raw and he only likes raw. The waitress is like up my a$$ the whole time to make sure I don't take sushi off of his plate. I'm like are you kidding me? I wouldn't eat that raw stuff even if it was free. :))) Haven't been back in a while...

Update: went back a second time and ate at the counter. I had an ant walk up on my soda cup and stopped eating immediately. Never went back to give them a third chance...Pharmacy department could improve on getting things filled correctly. Originally when I first started coming here there was always a problem every single time I came. Either my RX's weren't refilled after talking to someone on the phone or doing it on-line. For example of one problem: When I inquired about my Phenergan I was told I didn't have any refills & they would send a request to my PMD...come to find out the pharmacy tech. was referring to an old RX for Phenergan & Codeine cough syrup not my Phenergan tablets...really??? I specifically said phenergan & that was the most recent one filled between the two...I always double check my stuff before leaving.Yuk. This place is dirty and cheap. Not for me I would prefer Del Taco or Roberto's . I won't be back for a second time. The salsa wasn't bad otherwise it would get a 1 star.guy behind counter spitting out tobacco juice or something into garbage can. disgusting, take that outback cowboy. shipping rates seemed to be about a buck high from website calculation.Cheaper than Whole Foods, but not by much. 

Pros: Clean store
Organic produce selection is good. 
The Starbucks staff is friendly. 

Cons: Pricing is ridiculously high unless you find an on sale item. 
Security likes to follow you around. No I don't need to steal your stuff, sorry, no bust for you Mr. Wannabe cop. Dream on pal. 
Meat Counter is not as helpful as Vons or Whole Foods. 
Organic milk choices are weak, and what they do have is excessively overpriced. 
For a high end store they don't carry Valencia Orange Juice or good 2% Organic Chocolate Milk. For those things you have to go to Vons. 

Overall, if you need something and are pressed for time, go ahead and stop here. But if you want to watch what you spend, you really must go elsewhere.God, I have no idea why my relatives love this place.  The only thing I can think of is because they are from Utah and to them this is awesome japanese food.  Perhaps it was because we were in a big group which really shouldn't have an effect on anything but the service was piss poor.  So we ordered our food and gave the waitress the sushi ordering paper at the table.  Simple sushi...Inari, Tamago and California roll.  Easy right?  Should be out in 10-15 minutes!  That sushi came out when we were halfway done with dinner.  We ordered sake also, which we had to remind the waitress we ordered it because she forgot all about it.   So all in all...this palce goes down in my book worse than what I orginally rated it.Well...

What can you say?  This place does ok for what it is supposed to do.   Applebee's has made a lot of sacrifices lately as a company and the menu just continues to slide south.  

This location has mixed service.   We have been here twice and the first time it was pretty crazy bad.   The next time it was great.   

None of that changed the food.   For what you pay, you are getting cafeteria food.   To that end, you are probably paying too much.   

I hope Applebee's figures it out someday.Nice building and clean. Cheap but very little soap in the high pressure soap mode. I won't be backI don't know what it is but I have never been a big fan of Kohl's. This store is nice and clean, like many of the others but as far as having things I like, not so much. They also never seem to have great prices. I always feel I'm overpaying, unless I'm getting it off the discount rack. The store is basic. There never seems to be a lot of staff wandering around or at the checkout stations, so lines do get backed up. I'll stick to Ross and Marshalls for my discount shopping.Horrible Customer Service! The salesman that we had is so dull and boring! We bought love seat and he wasn't happy with our decision with picking our furniture. Duh! we live less than 2 mile from this RC Willey. I guess he wants to make more commission from us! Too bad, we are too cheap!Pumi's ok. The greeter was cool. I think he was the chef. I didn't like the dark ambiance. Service was not that great. Was a lil slow than usual. Food portion was not as gd as Sushi Bay. I prefer Sushi Bay.Where do I start. Well first off the receptionist at the front did not want to be there. She never gave me eye contact. In fact she continued to gossip with the people around her while blindly handing me things to fill out. Very cold. Next when I was finally called to the back, the lady was getting irritated at the fact I wanted to see the difference between 1 & 2. I mean common! Rude and cold again. I waited for the doctor to come in, he told me my prescription and when I asked how it was that my left eye was worse than my right when I could clearly see better out of me left he jumped around the question and left. It seemed as though he just wanted me out. At the checkout area, the woman spent the majority of the time on the phone with a friend and every time she looked up she remarked "she use to work here." I'm sitting there thinking to myself this is unbelievable. She's on the phone having a conversation while I'm waiting to be checked out. The staff was very unprofessional. The only good thing about the place was on lady who ran after me to give me a pair of contacts. She was more help in answering my questions than the doctor or any of the others in the back. She is the only reason they get 2 stars and not one.Only reason that I'm giving a "bad" review is that according to this site AND the Rosati's website, they are open until 10PM on Sundays.  I called last night, which happened to be Sunday, at 9:20PM.  I was told that they are closing in 10 minutes and the ovens were off.  I mentioned that on both Yelp and their own website, that it states that they are open until 10PM.  The girl apologized.

Really no sweat off my back.  I just called Round Table.  They were more than willing to take my business, and it was a great pie.Although this place is very cool and Gothic, nice decor, it still has the stench of an old motel. They have done a lot of renovation, but it just has this creepy old feel they just cant shake. I eaten at the restaurant twice, same single waitress in the place, and both times the food was def not worth the price. the restaurant was empty both times we ate there and the service was still bad, go figure? The bread she brought was old and stale and they toasted it lightly to mask the staleness. The food took too long to come out and she never came to check on us after taking the order. They try to be "Ala cart" fine dining so the menu is VERY small and very pricey. The average meal is $20 and up and doesn't come with a salad or anything....over all not worth it. Especially with all the gems in vegas..oh and did i mention you have to valet because theres no parking spaces anywhere?Yes, I am ruining The Artisan. Let me start by saying I have celebrated several birthdays over the years here and encouraged others. I have stayed in the rooms, dined here in the past and all I can say about it now is G-H-E-T-T-O. Not to be confused with ghetto fabulous either. 

The two stars is for the actual building and lighting and beautiful Gothic, eclectic decor and artwork making Artisan unique to others. The djs get a huge fist pound as well for spinning sick beats and being the only cool people left in the building. Now on to the huge three throbbing stars they will never see again. 

On my last visit it was a gorgeous night out and they had opened the patio. I venture out there thinking it would be a chic, chill place to listen to good music and have cocktails with friends. NOT. They were playing Justin Bieber through the sound system! Ugh. This is not Chuck E Cheese, people!!!! Secondly, if there was a waitress outside she was no where to be seen and I waited for over 30 minutes. Now to touch on the service. The Artisan use to have the most beautiful bartenders and cocktail waitresses in town. All with smiling faces and quick drinks just as you ordered them. The past two visits I made were for the after hours and I must say the waitresses all looked odd to me and not in a good way. One female looked sickly thin in her corset that appeared four sizes too large for her. The hair and makeup were not put together at all and she seemed on the verge of tears, too. The other looked completely TRASHED drunk and was slurring when getting our drink orders. When she stumbled back to bring our drinks they were all wrong times two rounds. Ugh. I don't know if she was bloated from all the alcohol she had been drinking, but her corset was ripping on the seams a bit! At least her blonde hair was "did" and she had glittery rave makeup on. I felt the service looked unprofessional and was unprofessional and both waitresses need interventions ASAP. 

This use to be the classy after hours all of the dancers from the shows and trendy locals would go to hide from the big clubs and enjoy drinks and friends in an upscale lounge. Now it appears like trash to me. If the staff is allowed to drink or not they should still be able to take drink orders and look professional. This place is a gem to Vegas and just isn't shining like it use to....... Work it out Artisan.I like this place. I want to begin by saying that. It's affordable and the after hours allows for you to keep the party going long after the bigger nightclubs close.

That being said, there are a few issues that leave something to be desired.

-Our reservation was for a double bed. Upon arriving, all that was available was a queen. This was very disappointing. They couldn't even offer us a rollaway. One guest had to sleep on the floor.

-On Facebook, an open bar is frequently advertised from 10-11. This is an awesome thing to offer guests, but often the bartenders are nowhere to be found. They only serve one type of vodka (which is pretty good), but often they don't have this vodka present at the bar (for whatever reason). 

-Furthermore, in regard to the open bar, the bartenders seemed very annoyed that's what I was there for (pregaming). I tipped well and all, but they were not happy that I was attending for the open bar. I couldn't really understand why.

-Lastly, if you need more bottles of water or towels, I hope you're not in a hurry. It takes around 45 minutes for whatever you need to find it's way to your room.

All in all, this is a fun place to stay and they have a lot to offer. I just feel like it could use some polishing.I agree with a lot of the reviews. there is pros and cons. 
I'll just write my experience since all else is mentioned already. 
- i find the hotel very pretty and awesome, but also very dark. 
- our room, though far away from the after hours nightclub - is right above the pool. 
they play music by the pool at all hours of the day, even when there is not a soul out there for hours on end. doesn't make sense to me. its repetitive and annoying. i would prefer quiet - but then again, i would just hear the highway a lot more. 
- our room also didn't have an electrical socket by the bed or the desk for the computer. it took me 3 days, but i finally got 2 extension cords. 
- the staff is mainly very nice and helpful. 
- the pool party was fun, but the music was too loud, with ear plugs. nobody was dancing, so i asked the manager to turn it down a bit, but he said that if more people come, it needs to be this loud so they know its a party. i said that when people are dancing or even standing, its a party. when everyone there (10 people) are laying down - its not a party and i don't  believe i need to go deaf while wearing earplugs. just doesn't make any sense to me. i know i'm older now... 37... but still. 
- the club - pretty as everything is here, but also too loud. hurts my ears with ear plugs. also not the music i like to dance to, so essentially i just walked out after less than 5 minutes. 
- i don't know if it says this anywhere, but this place is essentially a swingers hotel - so anything goes pretty much anywhere. i have no issues with that, on the contrary, but if you do - stay elsewhere. 
- there is not breakfast to be had unless you walk a mile away. 
- no coffee / tea - even though they did prepare it for me with a special request. 
- restaurant is only open friday and saturday. but if there's an event happening at the bar - then no food for you. 
- i think it would be an awesome place for a photo shoots of several kinds. 

summary - after you get used to the shortcomings, and the shitty music, its nice and most of all unique. but i have experienced better. 

the key is to know what to expect.

Ps - i am again stuck in the lobby right now because the elevator key again will not take me upstairs. 90% of the time that i have attempted to go upstairs in the elevator i needed to go get a new card key that still would not always work. When you are in a rush it could not be more frustrating. They keep apologizing but after 10 times that stopped having any validity. 

Its my last morning here before check out. 
They were able to extend my morning with a late check out which is always appreciated.Definitely not on my favorite list of Chinese restaurants around town. I know someone who is unfortunately in love with Cafe Noodle which caused my recent visit. My first time was 6 or 7 years ago and then I haven't been since until now! The food is better than it was before, but there are other places within walking distance that are better?! I would recommend HK Star which has the same prices during lunch and late dinner and the food is pretty delish. Sorry Cafe Noodle, but I think the public deserves to read this review.Food is ehhhh. Nothing special but gets the job done. Huge menu with a lot of options.First off - awesome name! haha! Now that we got that out of the way, one of my friends (who is a Vegas regular) recommended this place after a long night of eating, drinking, debating about politics, thinking about going clubbing, not going clubbing, getting old, and then getting hungry again!  I was excited, not becuase of the name, but because this place was supposed to have some really good PHO!

Sad to say, I was very disappointed!  The pho looked good, but didn't measure up to its good looks.  My pho had rare beef and beef balls, both of which were dry and flavorless.  I added my normal squeeze of lime and tons of sriracha but the broth was just not doing it for me.  I took a few sips/bites and I was done!  Finished up my beer and left quite unsatisfied.  Maybe it was just an off night or maybe because it was 3 in the morning?!!For being a Pho place their pho wasn't all that great :( I could tell right away from the clear broth and strong smell of anise that I wasn't going to like it. I had to add tons of sriracha and hoisin sauce just to get some flavor in my broth. 

The taste of anise was still overpowering and I didn't care for it at all. We had fried egg rolls as well and those were good. The peanut dipping sauce however was ice cold :( 

One other thing I didn't like was the lack of meat combinations. There were only about 5 choices to choose from. I give this place a "meh"Our server barrel spoke English, which made ordering and asking about menu items difficult. We asked about the clay pot dishes, and all he could tell us was that it took 30 minutes to make and that we wouldn't like it. Jason HATES when people.. ahem me.. tell him he won't like it, and he would have ordered it but was too hungry to wait.

Calamari: DELICIOUS! Definitely the highlight of the meal- garlic covered fried calamari. YUM!
Seafood Sizzler Platter: BLAND!!! This was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, and I was so disappointed by how bland it was. There was more calamari than anything else (a bummer after we split a huge appetizer of calamari). I didn't finish the plate, and didn't bother taking it home. That says a lot. 
Pork-Bowl Thing (Jason ordered it by photo): The pork was really good, but the rest of the bowl lacked creativity. He wasn't a fan of how much salad was in the bowl, and the sauce was bland. 

Upon leaving, I asked the server if they accepted AmEx, he told me yes so I left my card with Jason before I went to the restroom. When I came back, I was told that they don't accept American Express, just "regular cards". Huh? Again, language barrier. Frustrating.

PROS:
Calamari was good

CONS:
Language barrier
Service unhelpful
No checkup on how food was
Bland food

All in all, I definitely won't be backI was in Vegas for vacation and EDC (Electric Daisy Carnival). On my last day, I was craving pho, so my cousin and I searched yelp for recommended Vietnamese restaurants in chinatown. I saw that there were mixed reviews here, but the overall rating was good, so we chose Pho Kim Long.

When we got to the restaurant, there was a long wait, so I was anxious to try the pho, thinking it was going to be delicious. We finally got seated after 20 minutes, and the waitress assisted us right away. We ordered our food which was out in less than 10 minutes. I ordered a small bowl of pho and my cousin ordered a large bowl. My bowl had just about the same amount of noodles (a lot) his did, so that was strange. He ended up having to order extra noodles.

Overall, the restaurant was beautiful, the service was great, but the pho was kind of bland. The pricing was very affordable and cheap, so it was worth it for hungry tourists.Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed 
Pho was decent 
But the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interestingTheir Pho is decent, barely average compared to other Las Vegas Pho restaurants, and the service was terrible. The whole time the waiter was constantly rushing us, and once the order was placed we were ignored for the rest of the night. Getting our bill was a hassle as wellThe food is not that great and it is the priciest vietnamese restaurant in town. The service is the worst thing. The waiters are so mean. Has No manner in customer service. Talk really rude to us when we ask some question. These people need to take a manner lesson.So I've eaten here three times now and I think three times the charm was not. I'm such a foodie that I really wanted to like this place. It felt like it kept getting worse each time I came. My tummy was hurting after the third try. I've heard such good reviews but I guess it's only good when you are super hungry and taste buds are warped from clubbing all night.It LOOKED decent of a place to shop. 

Unfortunately, we went went today on a Sunday afternoon and the word to describe it is clusterfuck city. We have to shop on a weekend because it's our only time together to do so. 

Nothing the BF can't stand than a crowd of inconsiderate shoppers- blocking your way, standing in the middle of the aisle having a conversation, etc, etc.. Other than Wal-Mart, Mexican groceries are notorious for it. I grew up in Cali and I only found Cardenas market by my moms to be pleasant because it was huge enough for everyone to be the village idiot. This place however is not with very narrow aisles not good enough to let two carts go through comfortably. 

I started at produce and couldn't even get through to look around....

I wanted certain things that I can only get at a Mexican market- spices, certain kinds of hot sauces, etc. and I heard the bakery tres leches was decent.

 I guess I have to keep on living without it. 

I know that the market can't quite control the crowd, but when you get that busy and want to stock that much product- please do what SF market did and get a bigger place. 

 We came in, and after 5 minutes I had to leave and went to Super SF Market to do a Asian based week instead.My opinion of this chain keep dropping-seems like every time I visit one the wait is just really long,whether it be the wait to place your order (this is usually the case) or the wait to get your food.
This location of some reason, smells like farts and really bad. Inside and out. I had to leave to regain my appetite. My daughter kept making fart jokes because of it, which was amusing.
Seems like the prices keep going up too,at all of these.
I guess the two redeeming qualities was the service and the quality are still good.This is a fairly small store, though I did like a few things I saw there. I did not stay to try them on because I was very uncomfortable around the male shopkeeper. I might have put aside my discomfort and tried something on had it not been for a shouting match he got involved in immediately outside the front of the store. That display of temper made me so uncomfortable, I left.No higher than two stars. Service friendly. Food expensive, yet very basic. No wow factor here. Chart House a better choice. Medium crowd, yet they put us right at tables next to one another limiting privacy.came here since the crawfish place across the street was not gonna have the crawfish ready for another hour. decided to try the bun rieu and spring rolls and a cafe sua da.

the spring roll sauce was watery which ruins the whole thing cause spring rolls rely on the sauce to make them taste good. the bun rieu was not that great, more like a light tomato soup. prob gonna have to go back to give the pho a try. service was nice. coffee was cool.Stepping into this restaurant gives you the perception the food is going to taste good because of the aromatics of this place. But like an Abercrombie store, this smell can be deceiving. 

The pho is satisfactory. The broth came out hot, but nothing special. Noodles were flavorless as well. 

I was sad to see the bánh hi dish butchered. The rice vermicelli was woven just fine, but the choice of meat was just bad. It was like meats off a skewer you find at an American restaurant. The proper way to sautee the meats with some onions and sauce. The meat just was lacking any real flavor. So much failure for such a traditional dish.

Like most Asian restaurants, what is service? You sit down, order, eat, ask for check, pay, and leave.

While the Pho here is satisfactory, the issue with the bánh hi is disappointing. With so many other comparable Vietnamese places, might as well go to one of those other places instead.Over priced, nothing special. Seattle pho is where it's at.its okay...not good not bad...

I order a number 11, rare steak pho....the bowl is very small and the meat quality is below average. I will not be coming back. I paid 7.51 for a bowl of rare steak pho that was very small.

The restaurant is not very clean. Alot of fobs eat here. No-then wrong with that.  But being clean is a question mark here.I'm not a typical vietnamese girl, I really don't like to eat vietnamese food.  But when I'm with my family that's all they crave for.  The place wasn't that clean and the table was so sticky that I had to clean it again myself. Everything I ordered on the menu was either not made for that day or sold out. So I end up ordering the fried egg noodles with seafood & vegtables on top.  The noodles was under cooked and so it wasn't crispy and the sauce was very bland.  The chicken salad wasn't even that great either and the spring rolls paper were pretty hard on the spring rolls.In the Bay Area, I noticed a surge of Korean Tofu restaurants popping up.  And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named "Tofu Hut", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the "Grand Opening" sign up.  I figure we'd try out "Tofu Hut" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.

So, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.

Walking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.

They brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!

When the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu "spicy" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.  

To close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!  

Final bill: $70 including tip and tax.

This restaurant is sparse.  Lots of Koreans eating here, but perhaps I just have higher expectations and Tofu Hut doesn't cut it.The Kalbi was very good, but nothing else really stood out for us. The place is small, and nothing very special on the inside.  I would prefer to head across the street to DJK, or down the street to Mother's or Sura myself.Funny thing, if you notice Janelle G.'s review, she mentions she was staying at a hotel room, and a variety of her reviews are from Southern California.  As a Las Vegas resident, I have to wonder just how bad the Wal-Marts in Southern California are, really, for Janelle to have had such a wonderful experience at the Wal-Mart here in Las Vegas, verily the same Wal-Mart that is most convenient to my current place of residence. I try not to encourage regionalism, but that really does say something very telling to me.

I hate this particular Wal-Mart, plain and simple.  The only reason why I rate this store as high as 2 stars is because the people that I have come into contact with working at this Wal-Mart are pretty efficient, caring people doing a thankless, faceless job.

This Wal-Mart's prices are not competitive. The prices at this store are pathetic in comparison with what I expect out of Wal-Mart, regardless of their marketing. I imagine it is because of the large amount of tourist traffic. If you live in Las Vegas, like Rufus and Scott and I and others, shopping somewhere else is probably to our advantage.

At this store, I can almost never find pants that fit me, and I wear a pretty common size. I can barely find sweatpants in my size! 

Come the first of the month, don't even THINK of going during the day time. Illegal Immigrant City! There are at least 36 checkout registers, only 12 of which are open.Is this an airport hangar? Wtf! I've heard of ginormous Walmart's, but this one takes the cake (for me at least). That's not necessarily a bad thing, but finding what you're looking for isn't easy. Plus, if you're an impulsive shopper like myself, you're going home with dozens of other items you never intended on buying. Needless to say, you can find anything you're looking for and more here. Consider it an average supermarket, a Target and a Dollar Store all smushed into one place. 

The low rating is for general disorganization of the place (no bags to put fruits/veggies in, no prices on many items, no tops to bins, etc.), the check out line situation (25 registers with 6 open) and the fact that several people tried selling me home phone supplies while I was walking around (go away).A hit and a miss. We went here looking at the reviews and were disappointed. Don't get me wrong, if you're new to Indian food (like many reviewers here seem to be) you'll probably like it. Unfortunately for Samosa Fake-tory, we've had our share of good Indian food and Samosa Factory isn't it.

First off, to the uninitiated, samosas look and taste nothing like the one's you find here. I mean, not even close! Google samosas and you will see what they look like. After our samosas, we ordered the thalis (sort of an Indian mixed plate) and the naan (fluffy, delicious Indian bread) was great. I didn't like the saag (mustard leaf) but my SO did. Neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower. Contrary to popular claim, the rice wasn't basmati. You can't ever go wrong with mango lassi (mango flavored yogurt drink) and that probably was the best part of our meal. In summary, our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive FAIL. If you've never had a samosa please do yourself a favor and grab one from an authentic Indian restaurant. You will not regret it.

May I recommend Gandhi's on Paradise Road or Tamba on the strip for the most authentic and best Indian food in town?

Positives - The service was good. Our server, who I think is also the owner, seemed like a genuinely nice guy.read good reviews about this place so i decided to bring in my tent rainfly that i wanted to have the door replaced. 

i was helped by a younger woman, probably the daughter. the older woman was working and the older man was sewing. i explained what i wanted and she kinda just looked at me trying to think what to tell me.

the old guy started to speak in korean and glanced over and said in korean "tell him we cant do it." 

hmm ok... he didnt even take a second to look at it. then the daughter said something like "it could take 12 (mumbling) a long time, were backed up and it could take a long time. it might be expensive, maybe buy a new tent."

"12 months?"

"no one month"

"oh ok..."

"maybe take it to mikes shoe repair"

"ok thanks... bye"

so not much help here and not friendly much. 

maybe because i was wearing a military jacket or maybe cus i didnt "look" like a clean cut typical korean. but i found that i get treated differently by koreans depending on how i dress. 

even if they didnt intend to, they sure made me feel that way. 

i went to euphoria fashion up the road where they guy actually took the time to look at my tent and told me one week and $30 bucks. way better service.I wish I could give different ratings for quality of selection and price. Although I had a great time looking through the records, I found myself very disappointed after asking for the prices. The owner told me that a record I had picked out in perfect condition was worth $500-$800, and at that point, I knew there was no hope. It was missing the jacket, insert and everything else, and he still wanted $100 for it, without knowing if it was original pressing or even real. 

I really wish I could give this place a better rating, but $60 for a thrashed "Six Pack" single is not gonna get one. The owner was very nice, but he acted like an old comic book collector who's wife was forcing him to sell his collection, asking way too much for what he's got and unwilling to budge on price.

I bit the bullet and bought a Black Flag cassette for $20, and I'm positive that it isn't a first pressing. I don't consider myself "ripped off" because I wanted it.

I've never been told "you don't have to buy anything" so many times in a store.

I would go back, but I can't justify paying the prices that he found online and then proceeded to double.Unbelievable selection but Rich, the owner, is extremely difficult to deal with. His knowledge in punk and hardcore is completely non-existent, yet he asks for double the market price for all of his records. Nothing is priced in the store so he just wings the pricing by only looking at Popsike, an extremely inaccurate listing of eBay auctions that have ended. He refuses to look at Discogs, which is way more accurate and up to date. He also refuses to use eBay, which at first was very commendable but I quickly realized why. Enjoy the store, enjoying looking at the vast amount of records that are a part of history, but know what things are worth before checking out. I went back and forth on pricing for almost an hour and ended up saving $175 off his original price at the register. I spent so much time arguing about price that I ended up not enjoying my experience at all. With that said, check out Moondog Records in Vegas instead. 

In Vegas, you get ripped off just about everywhere you turn. This place is no different. You have been warned.I practically survuved on KFC in high school but over the last 20 yrs it has just lost its allure.


I still like the coleslaw & biscuits but the chicken just isnt up to snuff anymore. Last time I visited I tried the new Chipotle flavored and it was just awful. The stuff is soooo greasy I can never eat more than 1 pc and I'm a guy who can put away some food.

I still risk it every time I get a coupon in the mail...I guess I'm always hoping it will be good again.They won't deliver if you're more than 5 minutes away. Bad customer service. I don't recommend this location.Came here with family during a week trip to Vegas.  I just went there last week and I'm normally up for whole in the wall places so long as their food is good.  But this place I didn't really find anything worth remembering.  I ordered the loco moco.  It didn't have much taste and I tried to give away my food to the rest of the family.  A few of us ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet which I tasted and thought was not really worth coming back to.  Unfortunately I will not be back.  I think the only saving grace is the price is somewhat reasonable. I do really like the Hawaiian restaurant they have at the Cal much better.This is solely for the review of the boba. I only got the boba here because I've mistaken it for No 1 Boba which is across from here. There are 3 boba shops that serve boba in Chinatown plaza alone. 

Its one of those things you get what you pay for. $2.50 for a medium drink is cheap, but I still feel ripped off. I couldn't get boba because they ran out. The coconut was just okay. Could have been worst. The main issue is close to half my drink has ice left. I know its only $2.50, but loading it up with chunks of ice just makes you feel you're getting ripped off.

You have Volcano Tea and Tea Station within a couple of yards away. There shouldn't be any reason to come here for boba.Rating neutral.  I went by at 2:30 on Thursday.  Store locked, no sign in door, no answ on the phone and no voicemail picked up. Perhaps they had to run out suddenly, but this was quite annoying upon making a trip to the store when they're regularly supposed to be open.  A bit unprofessional.I should've known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing.  Thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it. 

The chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful. A tiny little plate of dried up little bites, almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the next.

Suffice it to say, India Oven is not worth putting on your list of "must dine at" spots in Las Vegas!A group of my friend and I arrived at this place around six, and it was very desolate.  There were three dancers in two hours and each of them did about three minutes worth of work.  

Though there was one very dexterous girl who was impressive, it was mostly depressed girls on their phones.  Really a mournful experience overall.  The only plusses were seeing the Make It Rain ATM machine (Why isn't this in Vons?)  and said one dancer who managed to do more pole tricks in four minutes than I've ever seen.

Also, I think the DJ/Announcer guy didn't even bother showing up for the first 45 minutes.  We went over to Treasures and had a way better time.  With alcohol.I just went last night for the first time in a little while with a group of friends to have a good time. Little Darlings used to be my club of choice for about 4 years. I used to go all the time because the atmosphere was great, the girls were very pretty, and I always had a good time there. I've spent a LOT of money there in the past.

They must have gone under new management recently because that was certainly not the case last night. We rolled up two cars deep. I drove the first car, and as soon as we got to the parking lot we were approached by security, who would not let us get a word in about waiting for our friends who were right behind us. He told us to get in the club or leave. We brushed it off and went into the club. We stood in line waiting for our friends. Another security approached my buddy and demanded that he take off his beanie. I understand its club policy, but he certainly didn't have to be rude about it.

By that point our friends still hadn't showed up, so we decided to step out and walk across the street to the empty parking lot to wait. When the rest of our party arrived we went back in and got back in line. The same security that gave my buddy attitude about his beanie was very pushy and rude getting everyone up against the wall so we could be funneled through the metal detector, which is a also a new inconvenience.

By now i'd had about enough of their attitude before we even got in the club so we turned around and walked out again. We were a decent sized group that brought several hundred dollars with us to spend that night but Little D's worked hard to lose our business. I'm sure the atmosphere inside the club is still decent if you can work through the attitude they give you at the door. They may have lost my business indefinitely.

We had a good time at Sheri's Cabaret later that night.This club is pretty small, and rather interesting. 

Be sure to check out Midget night here!I am comparing this Trader Joe's to the ones I have been to in San Diego and also in Arizona.

TJ's is known for hiring friendly people but most of the employees here say nothing to you when you walk past them. They also has the worst produce, and meat I have seen at a TJ's. Multiple times I have seen moldy produce and the last time I came in most of the turkey franks were bad but still on the shelf. I know TJ's employees are walking around the store all day so why don't they notice it before I do. Recently, I returned a few items and the woman asked me if something was wrong with them. No big deal but I'm used to the TJ's employees asking no questions and just taking back the items. Lastly some products are not labeled with the expiration date. This TJ's needs to step up their game.

P.S. I can't believe most of TJ's chocolates have corn syrup.the space is weird and is in desperate need of some tlc.  the food is not my style.  it lacks flavor and the menu choices are just not interesting.Sometimes these stores are messy with stuff thrown everywhere, today no exception. I like to stop in from time to time to check the inventory. Some days you can find a bargain and some days it's all about the mess throughout the entire store. 

I did find it amusing to see Christmas decorations out in full force right next to the discounted Halloween leftovers. But I went looking for a round table cloth but instead found yarn for a $1, so it was a good day for me at Big lots. 

If you go regularly, you can catch a few bargains now in then. I love the surprise of not knowing if they will have something and better yet find something you didn't expect. If you haven't been to Big lots, you should check it out.This review is for the Buffet only and NOT for the Casino or Hotel Facilities:

 Without getting into great detail I'll just sum this buffet up as "PEDESTRIAN" which isnt bad if you like mainstream. Its not the worst I've seen (Terribles Primm Valley).

On the good side:

1. The staff was very freindly including the chefs asking if everything was ok and if I needed anything to just ask .

2. The food they had that I tried was good = Fried fish, collard greens, Italian sausage in tomatoe sauce wt veg,, Tortilla pie.

3. A nice looking carving station, though I didnt try any.

4. A Stuffed Potato station wt BACON & sauted Onions...BAAAA-CON. lol
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the flip side:

- No tartar or cocktail sauce for the fish in sight.

- The booth I was sitting in was uncomfortably tight, even under the table  there were these poles I kept hitting my legs on.

- The deserts were just set out and there was nothing otherwise to keep them cool & as a result the Coconut Cream pie was room temp and not dazzling at all.

- And other minor weirdness like the set up of the buffet wt the potato salad being wt the jello and fruit and not on the other side wt the salad bar stuff.

 - The Price $10.88 for what was offered was kind of high in comparison to other buffets in the area. (Though I was told if I went downstairs & signed up for the Club Card I could get $3 off. This was very nice for them to offer and I passed only because I was hungry and had not eaten much of anything all day.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall I'd say if you were like me -in the area and hungry and not in the mood to play around - Go.

 However, in the future I'll be sticking wt Buffet of Asia up the road wt the Killer sushi bar & The Main Street Station Casino Dwntwn (Not affilliated wt any of these "Station" casinos.Don't be surprised with your experience here if you read the reviews below.  This hotel is popular with many types of conventions and large groups.  Consequently, the hotel has no problem booking rooms.  In fact, they are more than happy to give your room to another patron.  I submitted a paid reservation for the first of two nights, only to be told that it did not guarantee the room.  However, had I not shown up, they would have kept the money I paid for the room.  

The room was not ready when I checked in after 10pm ( LA - LV drive ).  The staff called housekeeping and was told that it would take an hour to make up a room.  I reminded the staff that I had a secured reservation and they offered to switch rooms from a two-queen to a king with a roll-away bed.  Huh! I declined and the staff bumped someone else from a room so I could have the room type that I had reserved ( with payment ).

The courtyard is trashy and dated. Stay in the tower rooms. 

I suppose that since I checked in late, and at the end of the line of convention goers, I was not informed of all the amenities that I would be charged when I checked out of the hotel.  "Free" wi-fi, pool, workout room, breakfast...  all are included in a "hotel service fee."  Evidently, in Vegas, free ain't free.

So, beware.If you want to experience old vegas this would be a good starter. 2 out of 5 stars.The Palace Station is essentially two hotels in one, and whether you like it or hate it largely depends on which of the two you pick.  This place has a Courtyard section, which is more like a motel, and the Tower section, which is decent.  I stayed at this hotel for three nights, the first in the Courtyard and the last two in a Tower room.  

The Courtyard area is disgusting.  In order to get to this part of the hotel, you have to walk out of the casino and into a separate building.  I felt like I was being punished for opting to be frugal and getting the cheaper room.  They claim that the entire Courtyard section is smoke-free, but don't kid yourself.  You'll be smelling cigarette smoke for the entire time you're there.  When I walked into the room, it felt like I was walking into an ashtray.  All the furniture and linens smell like cigarette smoke.  The room itself is very small.  The beds take up most of the space, and there isn't much room to walk around.  I didn't sleep very well in my one night in this room because the smell of cigarettes in the linens was nauseating.  Also, the walls are thin and don't block the sound of people talking in the hallway, or of the people in the adjacent rooms.  

The next morning, I went back to the check-in area and complained about the room.  They told me that they'd move me to a Tower room, but I'd have to pay $25 extra per night.  I asked to speak with the manager, who told me it's not their fault that people choose to smoke in an area that's designated as smoke free.  In her words, it's not the management's fault if the guests are "being rude" by smoking.  After an argument that lasted almost 10 minutes, during which I threatened to leave and then file a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back for the room, the manager finally gave in and switched me to a Tower room at no additional cost.

The Tower room was very decent.  There was no cigarette odor, the linens on the beds were very clean, and so was the bathroom.  The room was considerably larger than the one in the Courtyard, and had far more room to walk around.  This was a very decent, prototypical hotel room.  The WiFi in the room was also very good.

The casino itself is fairly standard.  They have slot machines and all the basic table games.  There are a number of nice places to eat.  It's certainly not a flashy casino, and it doesn't come close to rivaling those in hotels on The Strip, but it's pretty standard compared to other casinos that are off the strip.  This hotel advertises very heavily to locals, because  locals might enjoy being in a casino that doesn't feel touristy.  To that end, this place will serve them well.

I admit, I chose to stay at this hotel because of its connection to OJ Simpson.  This is the place where OJ came to get his property back from people who had stolen it from him, and now he's serving a lengthy prison term for what went down.  All of that happened in room 1203 in the Courtyard.  I definitely walked by that room just to check it out.

If you're coming to Vegas on a once in a lifetime vacation, don't stay here.  Pay the extra money and stay at a hotel on Las Vegas Blvd.  If you do end up staying here, definitely opt for the Tower rooms.  The Courtyard rooms aren't worth the discounted price.  Personally, I don't think I'll be coming back here again.  I didn't like it.This place is the worst hotel in Vegas . 
The company I work for booked me here and omg I have nothing nice to say about this place. 
Rooms small, the tv's are from 2 decades ago, and the beds didn't even have blanket. There is no coffee in the rooms and the charge for wifi!!I don't know why this place has such a high rating.  I thought the food was okay.  And the price was pretty reasonable.  I'm guessing in the late night after drinking and partying this is a great place to go.  Otherwise, I would recommend some of the other places in Vegas that the yelpers recommend.

We ordered the agadeshi tofu, jalapeno fried rice, chicken gizzards, braised pork belly, and a roll recommended by the waitress.  Everything was decently cooked but some of it was too greasy and the food tasted rushed.  There were a lot of people in the restaurant and waiting outside.

Finally we got the honey toast.  Really.... I don't understand the hype.  It's a cube of bread toasted with vanilla ice cream and honey poured on the top.  Really, that's it.

If you want to try something a little quirky and Raku is closed (where we initially wanted to go) I would say okay.  But this place isn't really that special and there are so many places to go for food in Vegas.pros: open late, friendly service, lots of choices

cons: food was below average, had to look all over the place to see what they offer

ordered: wagyu beef carpacio, hamachi sashimi, fried quail eggs, japanese beef patty, crab fried rice, uni in ponzo, cheese egg rolls, honey toastI have heard so many AMAZING things about this place and though I have tried this place over & over again. I cant seem to enjoy eating here at all.  

Every single time I have been brought here by friends who loved this restaurant, it has always been at least a 30-40minutes wait. Which I normally dont mind at all but waiting for something that I dont enjoy afterwards does not seem that it was worth waiting at all.

I dont remember what I ate because I let my friends that has been here order for me but of all the plates I tasted nothing stood out and nothing blew me away. I, also finally tried the honey toast that A LOT of people rave about, but it highly disappointed me.  maybe is because i did not like the honey taste or the texture of the honey toast, but it didnt taste that great either. 

I guess Ichiza isnt for everyone.Food is good! Service sucks....

I'm here on a Monday at 2pm and there are 2 waiters running around, one is a scatter brain and looks stressed...and there are about 5 tables...I think 2 waiters should be able to take care of 5 tables. I was a waiter once and had to take care of 6 tables by myself.

Food me and my friends ordered (total 4 of us):
- Ramen DX - love the soup base
- Smelt fish - the small fish with the smelt eggs inside yummm
- Squid - half was dry (probably from sitting on the counter too long and the waitress forgot to give it to us until later)
- Seaweed salad - good, more salad then seaweed though
- Salmon sashimi - good
- Spicy tuna roll - good
- Okra - good, fresh
- Fire roasted eggplant - good


Things they forgot:
-Spider roll - good if we actually got it on time (they gave it to the table next to us and when they realized we ordered it they took it off their table and gave it to us)
-Coffee (be aware that their coffee is $4.50...like the price of Starbucks but tastes weak and is in a small cup)
-We asked twice for them to refill our water
-We ordered 2 Half ramen and only one came and they forgot the soup...by the time they brought out the soup the noodles had dried up and stuck together...then an hour later they brought out my friends half ramen
- Pot Stickers (they took forever on this one and we asked twice and finally decided to cancel it because when we looked over at the waitress it looked like she forgot again)

Keep in mind we placed this order all together in the beginning and didn't add on anything and they still messed up.

So 2 stars for good food but horrible service, I would've given 1 star if the food was bad as well. We gave $1.00 tip on our $74.00 bill and left.Oh man so I know everyone just loves this place. 

Well I have been here a couple of times and usually go for the beef bowls. 


So this time around, we decided to get more of their specialty stuff. 

So we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama. 


The skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.

Surprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive 

Sorry maybe we went on an off nightFood is great as always, however the past few times their service has been horrible. We ordered 6 items at once and each dish came out about 15-20 minutes apart. Between the four of us we were starving.Tourist trap! Pricey mediocre chinese food, not quite the same cheap eats Sam Woo like in San Gabriel, Cali. You'll be paying twice as much for a roast duck here and it's super salty. This place takes CASH ONLY!Stop by here for dinner. We ordered the roast duck and wonton noodle soup, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork over rice, and Singapore noodle. Singapore noodle was ok, but found the curry wasn't mixed well, portion was spicier than other. The noodle soup and rice was decent. Service was typical, server was little pushy in taking our order. I would stick with the BBQ items here.Decent food. Roasted/bbq ducks were pretty good. Food comes out quick. Service horrible. 

Water and beverages are not given to you unless you specifically ask for it. Had to ask the waitress three freaking times just for a straw. The first time we asked she just went back to sip her ice coffee. Asked Multiple times just for a menu. And could not get the attention of waiters for forks. And when we did get our forks, they were nasty with food stuck in the crevices, all three of them. (Used forks or they just don't know how to clean). Ordered 4 items for to go. Only receiced three. Although it may be understandable because they are pretty busy, this place is not the place to be if you expect any attention from the staff. Im not asking for the service a super expensive restaurant would give but the staff here are just plain rude. Food not good enough to come back. The staff here just frustrates people. No wonder their reviews are so low. Shitty service = no tip. Id rather go to mcdonalds.What a shame...this store is closing after 21 years in business.  The family that owns the Red Rooster is moving to Illinois.  The lady that runs the place was very friendly and told me this after I inquired about the closing 7/15/10 sign on the door.

They used to have multiple floors and many rooms.  Now, they are reduced to a garage sale amount of stuff that appears to have been picked over.

I am sure this was a 4 or 5-star place at one time, however that day has passed.  The good news is that the Charleston Antique Mall is in full swing literally next door.  Go there instead.This was my first KBBQ experience in Vegas, and I must say after having some absolutely fantastic KBBQ in the LA area, Korean Garden just left me massively disappointed.  The service was good, but the food was simply bland and there was no AYCE (and the food was not cheap).  The pork belly was the kalbi were just lacking flavor, and some of the shrimp we got had not been cleaned very well (and again were pretty bland).  

From reading previous reviews, it seems this place has really fallen off lately - you'd be better served going up to the road to Honey Pig.Food is ok. The ladies were rush to close because we were the last customers, so no service for the last 15'. Certainly disappointed because they already ring us up so THEY DIDINT SERVE US during that time! Will not go back!Ambiance is great. You don't find many old-school restaurants like that in Vegas anymore. It's very dark and romantic as you dine with the oldies playing in the background. 

However the food is extremely over-priced and very bland. For appetizers, we ordered the Toasted Ravioli with Marinara Sauce $10, which was really good. 

For entree, they are best known for beef, so we order the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for two with Hollandaise and Béarnaise Sauce ($55 per person) and we added on Whipped Potatoes $8 on the side. We have never tried Chateaubriand Bouquetiere before and it was boxed out on the menu, looked special and tempting, so we figured we'd give it a try.

The Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which is a roasted beef tenderloin, was just ok. The sauces were very bland. For $55, it also came with some steams vegetables on the side (carrots, broccoli and asparagus), which were just plain steams with no seasoning at all. It was not even salted. 

Our total (for 2 people)  with 1 drink, 1 appetizer, Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for 2, and 1 side + tax & tip, came to $180.  I don't know if we just order the wrong item from the menu or they were just having an off-day?  But we went there on a Friday night, from 5-6:45 pm. We were the only table there. There was one couple that came in during our dinner, sat down, took a look at the menu, then left. Another coouple came in as we were leaving. But overall, the place was empty on a Friday night!I don't see what the big deal is about this place.

In Vegas for a trip away from the wives, we ended up at this old school steakhouse.

It started off well when the bellman at the hotel complimented us on our choice for dinner.

When we got to the restaurant, it was a bit bland outside. Picture a generic and plain front with the strip mall look.

We were seated into a booth, Mickey Rooney's!, and looked around to find a pretty empty room. It was a Thursday night at 7pm so we expected a bit more traffic in there.

The service was attentive enough (even when the waiter spilled a beer on the seat next to me). 

Come to think of it, he apologized but provided nothing more than getting me an extra napkin to get the beer from the seat and my pants. I didn't press it as much as I should have. 

An omen of things to come?

We skipped the starters since nothing was jumping out as us so we focused on the mains and sides.

Josh got the prime rib. I got a T-bone. 

Neither of us were happy. 

Both were ok to start, not bad, but not at all worth the price. We never felt that it was the best piece of meat we ever got in at a restaurant.  

There were no happy plates.

(Moreover, we both felt a little "off" after finishing.)

For the sides, we got broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the whipped potatoes. I can't speak for the little trees but the mushrooms were good enough while the potatoes were too buttery. I only tasted butter.

Our intention was there to try something off the strip and something historic. Next time in Vegas, and there always be a next time, I'll find some other old school place.

So, skip it. 

(I rounded up to 2 stars due to the fact it's been around so long.)I wanted a nice sit down dinner with the homies before we got the party started.  It being the oldest steakhouse in Vegas, I had to give it a try.  

The place is pretty swank if you like that old school feel, which I do.  The cozy booths and the piano player set the tone for what I expected to be an excellent evening.  

I snagged some of the Caesar's Salad that was prepared table-side.  I think I would have preferred the dressing come out of a bottle since it was so bland, I couldn't tell it was Caesar.  For an appetizer I went with the escargot that was touted as a house specialty and got sick from it immediately.  No, this wasn't my first or even tenth time having escargot.  I don't give up though and out came my monster of a prime rib.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.  The meat was full of tendons and gristle, out of the 24 ounces only about 10 was edible.  Sadly, the whipped potatoes were the highlight of the meal.

We did feel P.I.M.P. leaving the restaurant in their complimentary limo yet the free ride wasn't redeeming enough.Old school steakhouse off the strip near downtown.  Steak was perfectly cooked and delicious!  The ambiance was liking walking back into 1958 with red booths and dim lights.  The service however, was extremely lacking.  Our server poured our wine and we basically never saw him again.  We had to ask water refills.  That marred the experience for us.Really, there's a star here for service and a star here for ambience. If we weren't grading on a curve, it'd be 0 stars.

I took my boyfriend for his b-day ... we went to vegas to celebrate for the whole weekend, and his one request was a great prime rib dinner. We Yelped and Googled, settled on Golder Steer or Lawry's, asked around and decide on the Golden Steer.

Food was *terrible*. Granted, we got there at the end of the night, but when you're dropping $200 at minimum on dinner and wine, the 9:00 seating should still get some pretty badass food. Seafood stuffed mushrooms were squishy, bland and sub-par to even crappy Red Lobster stuffed mushrooms. Tableside Caesar was a joke. Had a really nice bottle of pinot noir, so even with teh bad food, we pressed on to dinner. 

My filet was overdone, underseasoned and grainy. His prime rib was repellant. You know that reason a lot of folks think prime rib is gross? His was it: raw, full of uncooked, glisteny fat and sitting in a pool of bloody 'au jus'. I couldn't even look at it. 

So, so disappointed. Will never be back.Had dinner there a few days ago with a large group. Bartender over charged for two drinks to start with and his boss had to return me $9 dollars . 
Next was dinner . The prime rib had a large portion of fat and not tasty. The seafood starter didn't taste fresh, bread was ok and the salad was bland. The dessert cheesecake was very plain. Ended up paying over $120 for a meal worth about $30 tops.Substitute cheese for actual flavor, burnt & limp potatoes, portions huge, unable to split checks, locally run. I support cuz its not a chain.Meh. The  big crispy homemade potato chips are awesome and make this really a 2.5-star place, but I can't in good conscience round up to 3.

No one greeted us when we walked in, and we had to wait a while to get someone to seat us, and our waitress was not exactly friendly and I felt like she just wanted to push us out the door the whole time (they close at 3 and we arrived at a little before 2). I had a feta cheese omelet which was huge (I didn't feel hungry for the rest of the day) but lacking in flavor (and feta). The pumpkin bread was a nice touch, but nothing amazing, and the coffee was weak. Also, two omelets, a soft drink and a cup of coffee totaled over $30 which just seems totally ridiculous for this kinda place.Okay, after reading the rest of the reviews, we were obviously there on an "off" night. The place was pretty empty and not much to write home about. However, the service was quick and friendly and the price were pretty damn cheap. 

I could see this place being fun on a night when the right crowd is there, we just weren't there on that night.Our sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry) was good, although my husband and I both had the runs that night.  They refused to serve us tap water.  They sell their own brand of bottled water.  When I raised a stink about it, they sullenly gave me some in a small soup container.  I don't know if it's a Vegas thing to not give a care about the environment, or just their corporate culture.  The staff seemed genuinely confused why I wouldn't buy a bottle of water.  If you eat there, demand some tap water on principle, please!Ya Think They'd Know the Menu!. Walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick.  Ordered the Cran' Club.  Turkey with Cranberry.  Took it to go and when I open the wrapper to eat it, I found they left off the cranberry.  Hope they read this and do something about it.  I'll let you all know.Somewhat still a fan BUT our driver was horrible. He didn't introduce himself so I don't even know his name...He didn't want to take us to where I asked. (Lee's Discount Liquors and Safeway/Luckys or in Vegas Vons). He said one or the other. 1st off, He wasn't there when we landed and walked down to baggage claim. I had to call Pres. Limo to see where he was..he showed up 5 minutes late which isn't bad but his behavior later on made me want to note that in this review. 2nd off, I paid to be picked up at the airport which is a hour ride ($60 total) so we had plenty of time to make 2 stops (FYI, we've done it before). 3rd off they put a hold on my card for $75 in case we wanted additional services! (they refunded it back since w didn't use additional services). Therefore, if we went over a hour by much, they could had just kept the amt charged to my card.

 I had to kinda argue with him about where we wanted to go but he was clear that Vons was going to be our only stop. (Btw, I informed Pres. Limo of the stop we wanted to make at Lee's. My friend who flew with me forgot a razor and toothpaste so that's why she wanted to stop. We could had went to Walgreens or CVS,it didn't matter. HE wanted to take us to Von's) We ended up getting our alkie from Vons..we could had got more bang for our buck at Lee's but whatever. Not to mention,he barely wanted to help us with our bags when they came down the carousal!

I called and told Pres Limo my experience. I informed them that I wasn't looking for a refund& still planned on using their services next time we come. I just wanted to let them know as I used their services for 3 yrs in a row and never had such a bad experience. The customer rep didn't seem to care and said he'd inform the manager and he MIGHT call me. Well he never did and to be honest, just a "we're so sorry!" would had worked just fine from the manager.

Car was clean however and the booking is very easy. They stay in contact with you via email when your trip is coming up which is good. I'll use them again..but maybe I won't. We'll see.Used Presidential to avoid cab line at airport.  Came down the escalator but didn't see my name displayed by any of the limo drivers, so called Presidential to learn that the driver was down at the bag claim for my flight.  Only problem was that I didn't have any checked bags!  So I had to go to the end of the building (bag claim #15) to find my driver, then walk back with him almost to the starting point in order to reach the limo parking area.  To add insult to injury, airport was empty that night so I'm not sure I saved any time taking the limo!  Otherwise car and service were fine.  Just wish they'd position drivers where every customer will see them, or at least ask customers in advance about checked bags and then advise where to find driver...Probably my least favorite out of all the home decor selection due to the limited variety and the more pricey price tags. It was a disappointment beyond the few shower curtains that I was able to purchase. 

A few minutes in the store and I was ready to leave. It lacks in area rugs and other decorative pieces. The essentials are all there.This place has received plenty of positive reviews on YELP. I am not sure why. 
I only came here for lunch because Ko-Mex was closed yesterday. From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. 

For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. 

My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....

My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.

The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes.  Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch.  The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place.I saw the above-average reviews on Yelp about this restaurant, and decided to come by to try my luck. Not so fast, because this was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have had in the last several months. 

We arrived for dinner, as a huge group of 25+ people were leaving the restaurant. Service was dismally slow, as my friend and I sat there staring at the counter waiting for someone to take our orders. When they finally brought us a glass of water each, as well as the side dishes, the water was the most disgusting water I have ever tasted; either someone did not wash the glasses right, or the pipes in the establishment are filthy, because the water tasted like buttermilk. 

When the waiters got around to acknowledging us, the service was otherwise pleasant and attentive, and our waitress was very helpful in explaining the dishes. Food was otherwise quite tasty, I ordered a bibim kook soo that was everything I would expect from a Korean restaurant like this. 

At the end of the meal however, as I was eating some kimchi, I found an odd-looking vegetable in there, and lo and behold, there's a pickled flying insect inside of a leaf! Those cooks in the back really need to wash their vegetables better. Sorry to say, but my experience here was just awful.Was expecting more fusion dishes, ended up being just another Korean restaurant. Food is pretty good for Korean, but we came here specifically for the interesting element of Hawaiian + Korean. And we saw none of that on the menu.Over all it wasn't too bad - I would give it 2.5 stars.

I heard good things about this place, so when I was in the area thought I would try it.  Stopped in for lunch at 12:30 and the place was dead.  No customers at lunch is never a good sign.  

It is a huge large restaurant with a full bar.  It was porbably nice 20 years ago and is in need of updating.  

The hostess was talking on her cell phone when she seated us - bad manners.

We walked in and they had a janky looking buffet but the food looked okay.  For $7.95 the price was right.  The food was about average - decent.   I had chile verde, beef colorado, chile rellanos...plenty of food for the money.

Overall  -  This place doesn't blow my skirt up.  It wasn't bad just better options out there.I ordered the Jasmine green milk tea with boba. It was very thick and had way too much milk. I wouldn't recommend getting their milk tea drinks."In God we trust. All others pay cash." 

I love a good donut and burger. What can I say I'm simple. Being from NC, the home of Krispy Kreme, I've become very good at spotting them. Ronalds has the hype and I don't think are the best. I usually go for a variety of em in one go- a regular glazed, apple fritter, twister and cinnamon roll.  The whole lot were pretty dry and lacked flavor the subtle flavor of yeast and buttermilk that I find at Winchells and Real Donut #1.

Also, they only take cash and close at 3 p.m.Meh.  After all the hype, I drove down here one morning while on vacation and bought a dozen, and then another dozen donut holes.  The holes were the highlight - everything tasted stale.  Maybe it's the lack of egg and milk, or maybe everything was stale by 10am.  Either way, I've had plenty of better donut experiences, and I really expected more after the reviews I read.  And who runs a cash-only business these days - I need my cash for other things in Vegas! :-)  Probably won't be back.Oh Lord Have Mercy.

I cannot believe I have to resort to THIS as my Asian food now. I'm sorry family, San Gabriel Valley (that's in Los Angeles, CA by the way), I have failed you guys.

This place....too greasy and it doesn't even taste good. Yuck. I ordered their Singapore Noodles and my noodles were all short and choppy. What the....

And this is NOT New York Style Chinese Food as they claim to be. I've been to NYC before and trust...this is NOTHING like the good Chinese food in New York City.As an unashamed woman, openly on birth control, I've been coming here for 3 years. The staff is pretty friendly & helpful. Although waiting times can get ridiculous. It varies because with or without appointments, sometimes I've waited 5 mins. Then theres times I've waited an hour. It's ridiculous how slow they seem to work! I recommend looking at doctors who will accept your insurance, especially if you want to save money. Planned parenthood provides many treatments & help, but it can be pricey because you're paying with cash. Take care of yourself either way! It's never too early to check for cancerous or infectious signs.Food was good service was bad. The hostess and our waitress were not friendly at all. I regret giving our waitress a big tip since her service sucked, but im a firm believer  in Karma and since I live mostly on tips I always feel the urge to always tip 20%.I've been to a couple locations in the Las Vegas area and this location didn't seem as busy as others. Bar was pretty empty for a Friday night. We were a party of 20-waitress had a hard time keeping up with checking to make sure we didn't need anything, nonetheless, waitress was very polite. 

Food was ok. Nothing to brag about. I had the Chicken Cajun Pasta and it was a bit too spicy for my liking. Place is alright. Just TGI.The only place open today before 11. The breakfast menu is very small.

Interior: Pretty shabby...

Service: Nothing spectacular

Food: the green scallion has too much pepper, covering the tastes of the scallions, the soybean milk is meh, the xiao long bao isnt soupy at all...

Overall: pretty close to AJ :/Tea Station, aka Tea Planet (does anyone else call it that besides my friends and I? ) is very well known in Las Vegas ever since the early 2000's. If you've never been there or you're a tourist in Vegas, it's definitely the place to go if you want to meet locals, especially the Asians. It's where we Asians flock at night time, and where the business people meet during the day. You get people of all ethnicity coming here too to buy "boba" since it's located in the heart of Chinatown. Due to it's name and longstanding reputation in Cali.. many people who aren't familiar with the other cheaper "boba" places in Las Vegas will come to TP just to drop $6 + tax for a simple drink. 

Honestly, I DO NOT understand how it became so popular or why, but for the super expensive price you pay just to get boba made from powder and service that is dirt poor.. TP is definitely not worth it!
Perhaps because it's located in a very busy complex (thanks to Ichiza upstairs, Kaya & Zizzy bar next door) the place is just always full of people..However, if you really look at it closely, not everyone orders drinks.. it's just a place to go hang out and crowd around...pretty much loiter, making it busy all the time. 

But in reality, Tea Planet is expensive, overpriced, and the service there is HORRIBLE. Majority of their drinks start off at $5+ tax for a medium, even though nothing is fresh but powdered.. their large drinks is $6+ tax.. Finger foods such as spicy chicken and what not is $5 + tax for a small plate, and a meal is $8.99 and up.. Some of their noodle bowls go up to $12.00 +tax.. Everything there is overpriced, and the portions are skimpy. Don't be fooled by their "tea flavored" prefixes on the menus.. There's no tea flavor in any of it. On top of that, they occasionally raise their prices up and their portions seems to get smaller and smaller over time. 

The other day, I met up with friends there and order my usual Royal Milk Tea in a pot. The "pot" is supposed to be their size medium at $5 + tax ( their "urn" is the large size) .. when I ordered it using the size names they wrote on their menu, my waitress had no idea what the eff I was talking about. She kept asking me what size I wanted and I kept repeating the pot. They only have pot and urn on the menus, how was I supposed to know the size. She should know because she works there but sure enough, she didn't. Everyone I talk to has something bad to say about the girls that serve there. Not only are they slow, but their attitude is so bitchy, especially when they mess up your drinks and you tell them to remake it. Overall, for the price you pay, service is just horrible. And since they bring out the drinks to you, it's customary to tip them too. Not worth it at all for bad service.It's the second time I've walked out of this place. Every time i come here the service has gotten worse. When it's been 20mins and you're still waiting on someone to take your order, it's time to leave. It's not cause they were busy. They were just chit chatting with each other and on their cell phones. When other groups come in later and they get to take their orders before you. Yeah. Don't think I'll be dining here much more. Granted their tea is good. Only reason why they still get stars from me.I try to avoid this place as much as I can. Although I am in love with their Rose Milk Tea with grass jelly, I cannot stand how terrible their customer service is. One time it took them 30 minutes to get our orders after being seated. RIDICULOUS right? I guess if you have all the time in the world and you don't mind getting your order in an hour then this is the place for you.I don't know his name but the guy taking to-go orders was so rude to my group and I. We were walking in and I went to get a boba tea and the guy was like, "is this your party?" I was like, "yes." 

"Are you sure? This whole party is yours?" 

I confirmed again. It seemed like it was an issue even though I told him we were getting to go. 

So I told him what I wanted and he have me my amount so I take out my wallet and he's like, "do you have cash? make sure you have cash."

I looked at him like, "I do?"

Why would he say that as he gives me my total even though he there's no sign or anything? He said it really rude too.

Luckily my boba was delicious or I'd burn this place to the ground. 
 
I doubt I'll be coming back. People at Volcano Tea are nicer.I ordered takeout after someone suggested I try the food. Not impressed at all. It definitely wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but it was not worth the $30 I spent for 2 chicken tacos (they forgot the fresh lime and pico de gallo so it was just bland chicken and lettuce), guacamole dip, and a small dinner with chicken and cheese (tasty but not worth the money). Honestly, I would have been more satisfied with Buffalo Wild Wing's chicken tacos and ultimate nachos.I visit Las Vegas on business for a nonprofit and have stayed here 3 times to keep our costs down.  I paid $26 earlier this week.  However, had I checked I could have paid $30 at Stratosphere a few blocks away for better room and ambiance.  Similar rates were available in nearby downtown (Fremont Hotel, etc).  

As a result I think I will pay a few dollars more for a better experience next time.  Room was small.  It was pretty clean although some dirt in bath was missed.  Toilet ran intermittently all night.  Linens and towels are clean but very worn.  No hair dryer or clock in the room, altho they will loan you these if they have them.  TV worked OK.

Neighborhood is the biggest drawback.  There are some empty stores and defunct wedding chapels, plus occasional homeless people and addicts on the sidewalk.

These folks are trying, and for some of the lowest rates in Nevada you can't expect too much.  I just think the experience is marginal enough that I will look for something more reliable next time.Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \Not much to say about this place, other than it's over priced. The food is kindly described as cafeteria food without your lunch lady. $20 per person is too much to ask for if the food isn't quality ( I would pay $20 at AYCE Korean bbq)

They have Mexican,Asian,American,Italian choices. 
For Mexican, they have nachos, tortillas, refried beans, fajita mix (chicken), ground beef, and finally chips and guacamole. 

I was not so fond of the Asian choices. Their teriyaki beef looked like dog food. Their sesame wings looked very dry probably were there for a while. There was some sushi  but I do not know much about sushi, people seemed to like it because the employee had to keep refilling them. I did not see any chow mein but there was fried rice and egg rolls.
 
As for American choices,  the mashed potato had a great taste, the cook sliced a piece of chicken for me which is very juicy . They had steamed veggies, and corn on a cob. Not much to brag about, but this is probably the best choices they had. 
In the Italian section there was only pasta, stuffed cabbage, spaghetti and meatballs, and grilled pork chops with mushroom sauce. 

Then dessert menu come to wherever idea of bakery goodies. And for those who cannot stuff themselves with more carbs they have the option of fruit.

Overall this place its not that bad but I will not pay $20 to eat here unless I get a discount for being a guest or they lower the price to at least $12-15 per person.We only stopped here because we were starving after getting up the tower and had no interest in searching something better. We both had the chicken avocado club wraps which to be fair, were very good. After we finally got them. This was probably around 9 PM on a Wednesday. The place had a few dozen guests at best but the service was very, very slow. Had to wait a long time to get a couple glasses of soda and even longer for our sandwiches. The 50's singing waiters was just annoying to me. But I know that's their thing there so others may really like it. For dessert we split a banana malt which I have to say was super good. Was not terrible overall but I'd probably not go here again.I will never give Denny's 5 stars after I experienced one of the worst times of my restaurant life! My man and I came in, were seated, given menus, then completely ignored! Yes ignored. They were even snickering. It wasn't even that packed. I think they need to go back to the drawing board.Hmmm...Im not sure what all the rave reviews are about...
My husband & I went to Vegas after he returned from a 9 month deployment.  Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...
Well, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  
When I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  
I ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  
I tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))
After the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! 
I'm telling you, save your money!  It's just not worth it!My husband chose the popular "Western" and I went with "Chocolate Crisp". Seconds later, we had sundaes in hand. The custard is smooth and creamy, and his choice was better than mine. His had hot caramel and fudge with pecans. Mine was pretty sweet with the chocolate sauce and it lacked any crisp. The peanuts were more like saw dust. The damage for two sundaes was nearly twelve bucks ($5.25 each). Can't say it's worth it.This place has been on my go to list for years and I really couldn't care less about the "marginal" area or cash only policy, I just wanted to love the custard.

Well no love here.  

Not like I'm expecting someone to be all yippy skippy about slinging out custard, but damn, this was one rude unhappy individual.

Limited selection of flavors.

We had chocolate, orange & coffee; nice consistency and texture, but all very blah in the flavor category.

Overall we renamed it to OK-It Frozen Custard.First mistake? we did not call ahead and order our pizza 30 minutes prior, second mistake? We ate there on Tuesday, the 2 for 1 large pizza deal...  This pizza is not really good hot right out of the oven, very greasy, it gets better after it has cooled off and the grease has congealed a bit, now go take some cholesterol medicine and enjoy!!!For those of you who don't know, Florida Cafe is the sister restaurant of Havana Grill in Henderson (off of Pebble & Eastern)...same owners. So much for thinking one sister is always prettier than the other.  And I don't know what I was thinking...because I like to give the benefit of the doubt, maybe I should only apply that to friends and not food.  I ordered the Pollo Frito (which I've had at HG as well)...I mean c'mon it's fried chicken. This shit was bland...my napkin had more flavor. Don't. Just don't. You're better off learning how to cook Cuban food at home and not regret spending the money.I was not impressed by Florida Cafe.  Many of the reviews I have read from Yelp and other review sites said it was the best cuban restaurant in Las Vegas, but I highly disagree.  My roommate and I came in for lunch on Sunday, and were a bit confused by the location, which is located inside of a Howard Johnson a little north of the strip.  Location is not a big deal to me, though, so I didn't think much of it.  

We ate in the cafe section, because the other section was closed off for a buffet, but we wanted to judge the restaurant on their everyday menu, and not a special weekend buffet.  The service was very average, and didn't put our order in until about 20 minutes after being seated.  But service isn't a big deal to me, as long as the food pulls through.  

We ordered an order of Croquetas, and an Empanada.  The croquetas were the worst I have ever had.  Very small, and lacking in flavor.  The outside was a little bit crispy, and the inside was dry and flavorless.  The empanada was pretty good, but nothing too special.  For our entrees, I ordered the Roasted Leg of Pork (pierna de puerco), which is a staple at any cuban restaurant.  My roommate ordered the steak sandwich.  Neither of us were very pleased.  The sandwich was okay, but didn't have much going on.  The leg of pork was tender, but overly oily, and did not have much of the bitter orange and garlic flavor that Pierna de Puerco usually has.  

Overall, we were very disappointed, and will probably not come back because there is a better cuban place closer to me.I visited the all-you can eat buffet Cuban adjacent to the restaurant.  I believe it doubles as a lounge after hour. (The stage, dj booth and large speaker are a dead give away.)  

The location is kind of out of the way.  Their sister restaurant (Havana Grill) is much more convenient.  The restaurant is located in the Howard Johnson Motel in the sketchy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that no one ever talks about (north of the Stratosphere).  I only went  because I had a Groupon. 

The Good:  the arroz con pollo and tres leches cakes (chocolate and traditional) are very good.  The staff was friendly.

The Bad: pretty much everything else.  Be careful when grabbing the serving spoons, some were hot enough to burn and some were cold just like the food in the trey.  So a lot of the meat was dry from sitting at too hot of a temperature or was cold because it was not held at proper temp.

I doubt I'll be back even if there were another  Groupon, unless I have an insatiable urge for tres leches cake.Okay... so I held off on reviewing Florida Cafe mainly due to the fact that it's my dad's favorite restaurant and I didn't have it in me to give it a mediocre rating. BUT... I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm basing my review on the last two visits I had at the restaurant within the past two months. 

When you walk into the restaurant there is a podium where you would expect to be greeted immediately by a host of some sort to seat you. Both of the last two times I stood here patiently, I stood for about five minutes. It was one of those lengthy moments where you begin to search for the "please seat yourself" sign because it was RIDICULOUS. Upon being seated, we looked over the menus, but were set to order about 5 minutes after sitting down. We gave the subtle (and not so subtle) hints of being ready (putting all our menus down, making eye contact with EVERY employee, waving to the waitresses), and ten minutes later, nothing. Waiters and waitresses would pass our tables, what appeared to be managers would point to our tables to their employees, and finally a waitress came to take our order. THANK GOODNESS.

So, I must say I do enjoy the food here. I always make sure to order the papas rellenas (potato balls), masitas de puerco (fried pork and onions), camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp), and maduros (plantain bananas). 

Sadly, while I am a firm believer in the fact that good food can outweigh less than superior service, that doesn't apply here. We had gotten our waters a good thirty minutes after sitting down and without the lemons/limes we had asked for. Waters were not refilled a single time. Not a single employee had paid a visit to our table despite passing it multiple times. After we had completely cleaned off our plates, we waited to be given our check. 10 minutes passed and I eventually waved to our waitress for the check. 5 minutes passed and still no check. I began growing more impatient as the clock kept ticking that I took the liberty of stacking all of our plates, cups, silverware, and napkins and placing it at the end of our table.  5 minutes after that, the check finally came. 

It seems to me that while I do understand that each position in the restaurant business has its own duties, it doesn't excuse being ignored and unattended to. Everyone outside of the kitchen whether it be the managers, waiters, or servers should be able to communicate with customers, refill beverages, take an order, or even be able to visibly see when a customer needs their assistance. 

All I have to say is, sometimes tip is based on service... and it definitely was in this case.The food was ok,nothing special, but it was my first time having cuban food.  I actually made the trip up from the strip (Im not a local) to visit this place after seeing it while I was going to look at the Pawn Stars pawn shop.  The wait staff was pretty horrible, and after waiting 20 minutes to get my check I had to walk up and find a waitress.  The waitress also seemed pretty bothered by me asking her for the check.  Id try cuban food again, but I would not go back here.Been here several times over the years and although the food is delicious,  the service sucks. Won't be coming back again, because the service this last time was so bad. We waited 25 mins without one acknowledgment, finally he takes our drink order, didn't get any better from there. My advice,  go to Havana grill, same food, same owner, better service.Please see my review about the General Store. That is not included in this review. 

This place is on LOCK DOWN. You cannot shop here comfortably without people watching you intently. The security officers and employees are all ready to jump on you if you look just a little suspicious. I made sure to stare them down like they were staring me down. 

Everything here is really cheaply made. There are some super nice gift shops in Vegas, and this one is not it. I kept telling my boyfriend that it was like an overpriced dollar store. I can't believe my sister in law actually bought $40 worth of shit here. I purchased three shot glasses myself, but you can't beat that for 99 cents. If you want nice souvenirs I recommend the ABC store on Fremont. I personally love the Hello Kitty Las Vegas goodies. :)

I think this place could use a lot of improvements. It's sketchy, it's dirty and the employees are downright MISERABLE! The greeter lady said to us "You can go here and walk all the way around. Remember to have fun, because it is fun!" But she didn't sound so convinced of that herself. There was a definite vacancy in her eyes. It almost made me feel bad for her. 

Anyway, the only thing worth coming here for is the liquor store. It's a good one if you are sick of overpriced cocktails and beers in hotels and clubs.Place is a complete sham. They will completely and blatantly steal your money and charge, charge, charge your card. Then they will ask you for tips. Only about 10 hot girls that rock the place. If you go here, request Annaleah, Annika, Violet, Eve, Ms. Johnson and/or Logan James. Rest look like coked out whores. Cocktail waitresses and the VIP host lady in the back are rude and greedy. The place is EXTREMELY expensive, without the benefits of a high class club. VIP is too confusing with their prices and they WILL rip you off. Fat girls, ugly girls, old women, pregnant women, and be prepared to walk into a cloud of cigarette and cigar smoke.This was my first time here especially to Vegas. My boyfriend and I decided to change up our meals and have some Thai food for our trip. Because we were staying at Stratosphere for our last day, we stopped by here for lunch. The ratings were a bit high so we also thought we'd give it a shot. 

FAIL! I would have to repeat on some viewers that if you haven't had good thai food if you think this place is good. The vibe coming in here wasn't very pleasant. The Pad Thai that I got was gross to me. Good thing was during lunch hour my meal turned into a lunch special which came with an egg roll and the price reduced a little. And the egg roll was gross too.

Suppose they are going to relocate to soon just in case there are people who are in love with this place. Just a heads up in this case. Overall, I would never come back.My husband and I decided to have lunch near his office and opted to try something different. I figured some of the best ethnic food comes from the hole in the wall places anyway. We walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The interior looked classy and was quite spacious.  We decided to try several of their pupusas ($1.50 ea), in addition I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had their carne asada burrito. The pupusas were very good, and a steal for the price. The rest of the food was not anything special that would warrant coming back.

The service was non existent after our food came out. I ran out of water and pushing my cup damn near off the edge of the table I guess was not enough of a hint that I would like a refill. There were no signs posted that you're suppose to pay at the register anywhere in the restaurant, and maybe that's not the standard procedure, but we ended up going up to the register to pay. It was a fairly inexpensive lunch with solid pupusas and non existent service. I would not go back.Hated it! Tried the Cuban sandwich and the pork was very dry.This is a very "ghetto" Target if you will. It is small, sort of dirty, has a cramped front end to check out, and is the only Target Store in Las Vegas with no store services. Not even a Pizza Hut Express or Starbucks. The merchandise selection lacks too. I would never give a Target less than three stars, but this one really let me down. I guess part of the problem is the part of town and it was one of the first three Targets in Las Vegas, built back in 1987. Unfortunately, if you live on this side of town, this is your ONLY Target for miles in any direction, and none of the other stores are any better, they're all more rundown and cramped than this.Tacos are good but they out lots of guacamole. ths the only downside i found. the place is your average taqueria. Staff is friendly. Not my favorite taco place, though!nWell....
I have to admit I decided to come here because I was already tired and frazzled and Tacos El Gordo hasn't had a drive-thru window since soon after they opened. Gee, you'd think the last thing a fast food place would want is to cut off their fat, lazy customer base- just who is the "El Gordo" they purport to be catering to, anyway?

So, I saw the neon drive-thru sign beckoning to me from the darkness of the west end of the parking lot and honed in like a cruise missile. Unfortunately, it was so dark that I didn't see the curb and in my haste managed to slam my car up onto the island. No biggie, I'm sure the undercarriage benefited from a little barnacle scraping, but when I finally managed to maneuver into position at the ordering station, I was hit with a blast of Spanish-accented static. 

Yes, the system crashed the same time I did. (No connection). I figured it might be for the better, since their English is almost as limited as my Spanish and I could at least point and gesture in person. Nonetheless, I was growing increasingly unhappy.

Got some carnitas tacos, a quesadilla on a corn tortilla (MY-EEEZ!), and a burrito for the Anaconda. This required intense negotiation and the services of three volunteer interpreters, but I got my bag and headed home.

Until now, I always thought that the basic ingredient of carnitas was pork. Apparently, it's salt. How bad was it? I didn't eat it, if that tells you anything. And if you knew me, that would tell you everything.

In their favor, they were friendly and tried hard, and I can't hold it against a Mexican establishment in a Mexican neighborhood that caters mostly to a Mexican clientele for speaking mostly Mexican.

Their tacos were $3 as opposed to TEG's at $2, but they had more than twice as much meat. Too bad it wasn't edible. And if you agree to "with everything", that means cheese and sour cream and guacamole, (in other words, the parts that make life worth living), it will increase the cost by a buck and a half each! Whaaaat? Since when is cheese an extra on a taco? And the burrito was ok but smaller than you usually get for the price.

It was a bad experience, but maybe I'll try them again when we're both having a better day.Me thinks not.
This place is great when it comes to product or merchandise. I can always and I mean always find something I like. I have a certain routine I follow.

My ritual: first shoes/jeans/skirts/then shirts. After that I just start to wander about.

They are pretty organized as well by size and category. Which is always a plus.
The only downer to this place is that the staff is horribly trained or they just don't give a shiz. 
99% of the time the items are marked at half price of the original price. So Ed hardy sneaks are normally $30. Well here they cost $20 or $15, depending on the day you go. 

My last experience was the final straw though, I went to the shoes found some brand new Reebok. They said $15.00.
 So I said to myself, "they are so new, they are worth it."

 I walk up to the register and the lady "the manager" says 'no no, these are $25.00."

 I said but it says $15. 
She said, "I am sorry but one of the reps. must have missed priced them." 

so I say, "can you just honor the price. I mean they are prices by your staff." 

The manager went on to say," I am sorry ma'am but we have a policy and we have to follow that policy."

I ended up asking for corp. number which was a moot point, because they have never called me back and never did anything to rectify the situation. 
Never again.A good place to stop by quickly. Coming here you need to know what to buy so you can be in and out of here. Location is terrible. 

I've come here numerous times and walk in and find the staff on their phone doing nothing. Last visit a young lady was on her phone at the register texting away and briefly acknowledged me without taking her eyes off her phone. Uhh..... Nice customer service skills. 

There is a one guy that works here (can't remember his name) that always helps me and is very efficient. I was pretty indecisive about items located at the very top self which needed a ladder to get and he was nice enough to stay on that ladder as long as I needed him too. 

I hardly ever go to Big 5. This one is the closest to my home so I've come here the most but I have had better service at the other locations.This place is IMPOSSIBLE to find. I drove up and down sahara and they give horrible directions when you call them.

Anyway, I ordered the Chow Mein with flat noodles and it was mediocre to say the least. It had a sight garlic flavor, but other than that NOTHING. Very disappointed because it was super greasy. By far not one of the best places I've been to.

I also got the eggrolls & they had no flavor either.. the plum sauce was horrible with it. 

Didn't hate this place, but I probably won't ever be going back.OK now, with enough heat under the heels I finally got some responses and some fixes. So I'll bump them up a bit, but I'm still unhappy to be trodden under the big corporate boot. Being the only game in town, they  have me hostage- And I don't like it one bit! 

If they get their butts together and execute the recycling bins as promised I might bump them up again.Been here quite a few times and it seems that the food quality has gone down. We visit from Denver and this year we ordered lechon kawali, pusit, bangus, and dinuguan. Lechon kawali was good, but the pusit was dry and the bangus was cold. We went for lunch.The pizza is just ok at its best, and the wings, though small, are decent.  There's lots of really good pizza in Vegas and Broadway doesn't quite make the cut but it's close to home and take out or delivery, service is pretty good.If you're looking for a quick bite while at the North Outlets, then this would be a pretty good choice - but I wouldn't add it to my rotation by any means. I got a slice of the veggie which came stacked high with broccoli (I know, broccoli on a pizza!! :D), tomatoes, black olives and cheese. Because the fresh ingredients had been sitting there for so long that they had to re-heat my piece before serving it to me, the crust was completely soggy, I had to attempt to eat it with a fork and knife. The flavors worked nicely, but the texture was all off. My husband got a slice of pepperoni and was happy with it, but he would eat anything shy of cardboard. 

The beautiful garlic bread was quite intriguing, maybe we'll give it a try next time around, but I won't spring for a slice again.Food was ok. I didn't care about the ambience.First, this place is located in a gas station.  Not that it makes it bad.  In fact, it makes it more appealing to me.  Unfortunately the food was just meh.  The shredded beef had very little flavor to it.  The enchilada sauce also needed some spice.  I guess if I was drunk off my rocker I might want everything on the menu.  Being sober, on a Saturday around 1pm, this place definitely needed some help.I like this location better than some others in town. Smith's is owned by Kroger. Unless they've changed they are open 24 hours which is necessary because it's too hot to do anything until after 10 p.m. anyway. 

I don't like shopping at 10 p.m. and having the aisles blocked with boxes they are stocking. Can't this wait until later in the evening when nobody is shopping?More like 2.5 stars for this establishment.  So there's Whole Foods Market, and then there are the small businesses that cater to the vegetarian/vegan/raw food community selling natural and organic foods, supplements etc.  I try to support them because they have access to speciality items that a large chain may not carry.

I found them on happycow.net and thought well I need to check them out to see what's available and I need to purchase some hemp protein powder.  

I pull up in front of a store that's not very big.  As soon as I enter, I see aisles and aisles of supplements, pills, some personal care items and that's about it.  Where's all the "raw food" that was supposedly advertised?  I found some bulk raw nuts and seeds, raisins, prunes and medjool dates.  I found some raw chocolate and then some food/snack bars, only rawvolution with 2 different flavours.  In the front, there are 2 freezer cases, a few frozen vegetarian meat items, some ice cream, sorbet and that's it???  What a disappointment.  There were some cold drinks in the fridge case all the way in the back, some flax and hemp oils, probiotics.  

Although there's a large selection of supplements, more doesn't necessarily mean better.  I've spent so much time researching supplements that at the end of the day, most of what they carried are pretty standard and not worth their weight or price.  Oh, and the prices are high.  Hemp protein from Nutiva was $16.99, WOW.  I could purchase that for at least $4 less at Whole Foods.  Also, when you have too many products, you confuse the customer.  

Either way, I felt misled, I must have looked around for at least a good 10-15 minutes, and was just disappointed.  I walked out without a single purchase.

And the brand supplements that I like, they didn't carry. Too bad.  But one good thing is they carry CellFood.  Good stuff.

Customer service wasn't particularly good.  I circled around 3 times and no one bothered to ask me if I needed help.  Lame.Popular buffet in the burbs focusing on various asian cuisines, including, Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese. The quality of the food is just OK, as you'd for these lower end buffets. This is certainly no Todai. The overall quality is influenced greatly by how long the food has been sitting under the heat lamps. The first plate of Pad Thai was pretty good, while a later plate was pretty lackluster.

While my dad loves the Korean beef that is cooked by a chef, I like the  garlic string beans best. There at least a half dozen different chicken dishes, in all different styles. I didn't care for the lemon chicken, while the others were decent.  My mom said the fish balls weren't too good. The sushi are unremarkable.

They have yellow watermelon which is good. I like the almond jello too. I'd avoid the perennial chocolate fountain.

Service is average. Sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly. Here they are about average.

$6.99 lunch includes hot tea, but not sodas. Good value. Get there early as there's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so.I came with an Asian tour bus group and they had more than enough seating for 30 plus of us.  $12 for lunch buffet with very sparse selection.  I didn't try the Mongolian stir-fry.  Food was mediocre and I think they only served different variations of california roll.  

Verdict - I was mildly satisfied and didn't get a stomachache, so I guess that's a win.They have great deals on Shampoos & Conditioners. I use Redken which is usually on sale either buy 1 get 1 free or buy 2 get 1 free I only wish they had good customer service.This place was a let down and is waaay over hyped. Everything was so bland and there was absolutely no spice to the dishes, even when asking for 10 with 10 being the spiciest. I ordered a thai tea, papaya salad, beef jerky, pad see eww and my buddy ordered a mongolian beef dish. It was nothing to rave about. I wish I could move all my favorite food joints from Cali to Vegas, I'll be such a happy fatty :) 

I will give this place another try but this time I will order the thai boat noodle soup. My friend, who is also from CA said it was the only one that came close to our shops in CA SO... I will give it another go. This time I will remember to ask for the spiciness to be 15.I feel like the black sheep because I was not a fan of the food here.  I have been here twice (because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and try other dishes).  If you like your Thai curries on the sweet side, then you will like this restaurant.  I, on the other hand, do not- which is why I was a bit turned off.  I have tried the panang, duck curry, and pad thai, and all were overly sweet.

The ambience is nice, the staff is friendly- but I want delicious Thai food- and this restaurant did not deliver in that category for me.Is it me or has the quality of food gone down? I  have been going to Pin Kaow for years and it was one of my favorite thai restaurants because of it's authenticity. However, I recently went after a very long time and I was so disappointed in the food. I feel like the food is not authentic and flavorous as it use to be. The food was just so bland and lacked the quality it use to have. Before, Pin Kaow was the best thai restaurant in Vegas, but I don't think that is true anymore. Hopefully I'll find one that I enjoy like I did with Pin Kaow when it use to be really good.I always loved this restaurant but moved out of the area & would return a few times but I went today for the first time for their lunch special & was quite disappointed! Portions were so small. There were maybe 2 pieces of small, very dry overcooked chicken. Taste was bland. I don't know if I'll ever go back.Last nights dinner (take out) was disappointing.  We have ordered a couple times from here in the past, and this was not what we remembered.... or perhaps we have just been to enough other top-notch Thai restaurants since then?  

We ordered the Crying Tiger beef, catfish green curry, and chicken pad thai.    The crying tiger beef was ok -- it was basically a steak with a little heap of salad and a big wedge of cabbage.   The sauce was good, but we would have preferred if the steak were marinated in it more.  

Catfish Green Curry was pretty good, but a little salty.   Otherwise we would go back for that dish!

the Pad Thai was well, pitiful.   Cooked well, but hardly any flavor - not what one would expect from pad thai.     Added some of our own lime juice (it did not come with any lime) which made it more palatable.   Needed more sauce and it would have been good. 

Overall, not a bad meal, but we probably won't be back -- Especially not for their prices!Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check...Food was okay, service was fine.. but got serious diarrhea shortly after leaving there (both of us did)... same thing happened last time we were there also.  The first time I wrote it off as a fluke, could have caught that bug elsewhere.. but two times?  Health Department is failing us here, and so is Tony Roma's.I was really annoyed with my experience here! The guy was friendly enough was was talking to me about the weather and how I was from out of the state then my car failed because my check engine light was on! I was just annoyed because this is the first time I have had a smog test so I had no idea they cared about my check engine light (and the light is only on because of a censor that's messed up nothing that would effect my cars ability to be on the road) that and the guy sat in my car at the very beginning before the test why couldn't he have just told me it was going to fail before doing the test and making me pay for it??! I would have just gotten it fixed then come back but I am not going back there again that's the way you do business.Came here last weekend for breakfast. It was my second time there. I wanted to like this place, really, as I generally like to patronize the mom and pop shops and the dives. However, I just can't get into this for breakfast.  It was vacant when we were there, unusually vacant per the waitresses.  The waitresses were friendly, almost to much so, I think the waitress we had would have gladly pulled up a seat and incesently talked the whole time we were there. Not that I don't appreciate friendliness but I also wanted to just enjoy the company of who I was with. Decor is a throw back to the 70's, with bright oranges and yellows. Definetely a locals older crowd. Like Cheers - everyone knew their names of the few of other people that were sitting at the lunch counter. 

I had the the Pioneer Breakfast, the big ticket item on the menu ($8.95), but I wanted eggs and pancakes and this fulfilled both of my requirements. I thought I was ordering too much food and wouldn't be able to finish but in reality the portion size was that I could finish it. Granted I gave my bacon away. Bacon was crispy, not microwaved like IHOP does. Pancakes were decent, but I didn't like that they only provided you with Log Cabin syrup - I guess I shouldn't expect maple syrup. They did accomodate me when I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese on them (my way of trying to incorporate a omelet into my breakfast as well). 

So it was okay, but I wouldn't go back. Previously I had the chicken fried steak, I was underwhelmed with the quality- chewy and tough. Although, to their credit, the waitress I had then (who was great, and I think I have read other Yelp reviews on her) tried to warn me of the inconsistency in the product depending on who was cooking, which was ironically the owner on that day, and I went against her sound advice as I was determined to have it.  That time my friend at the pork cutlet with gravy and she loved it, I tried a bight and it was very tender, I should have picked the pork. 

It is inexpensive, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and try somewhere else next time.My fiancé had a great experience when purchasing my wedding band and engagement ring. However, the 2 times after that our service got worse.

We came in to get my engagement ad wedding band sized and while looking up our information she asks my fiancé, "Did you have a pair of earrings as well?" When I looked up at my fiance's face he was panicked and very angry. Turns out those earrings were to be my 1 year anniversary gift. Unfortunately, that isn't the worse part. After he told her she had ruined his surprise, she just simply said oh sorry and just continued working on the computer. SHE DIDNT CARE! That offended me so much!

After dropping off my rings and being told I would be contacted via email when they are ready, they never emailed us. I had to call. My engagement ring was done in 3 weeks (I was told 10 days), and my wedding band still wasn't done. 

We dropped by today because we still didn't hear from them. I go to try on my wedding band and it doesn't fit! On our receipt in very large print it said 5 1/2 and they did it as 4 3/4. How do you have my rings for OVER A MONTH and it's not even sized correctly?! I'm just not happy with this place at all. 

The only positive is my rings are beautiful and I've had no issues with diamonds falling out or anything like that.This place is now called Rhapsodille. Cheap, good style, color coded, but fitting room is more a prison type experience...not that I've been to prison, but I'm sure it would be like this. Just a big room with mirrors and chairs....everyone tries on together...Yay. So make sure you wear your underwear! You're welcome. One of the young sales girls was not customer oriented in the least....too much attitude, but what do you expect when your buying a 15 dollar dress...take the good with the bad.I have to give the staff at this store credit for dealing with the flood of crackheads that visit this store on a daily basis. That being said, I can understand where some of the gruffness in customer service comes from. I'd be angry too if I was constantly trying to help some wackadoo figure out the self-check out system without saying "hey dummy, why didn't you just go to a regular check out line?"


This Smith's was recently rennovated and has a much more aesthetically pleasing look to it however there is no doubt in my mind that the customers patronizing this location will trash it up  just as quickly as it was rennovated.

The store itself is pretty well stocked and has a nice produce section. The prices are decent and the staff is ok. But. Like I said, they deal with a lot of crack heads and that could definitely affect how they interact with everyone.

It's hard not to judge a business on its patrons, but I can't help it with this Smith's. If you want a quick shopping trip, don't come here. Because it's very likely that the person in front of you is going to get their card declined, not have enough cash or tries to bargain with the cashier because they've mistaken this business for the swapmeet they frequent on the weekends. The staff has no control over this, but it makes for a very stressful experience, especially if you're just trying to get one or two things and head home after a long day of work.

This Smith's is ok-if you're in the area you know there's not much to choose from so you accept it. I often drive miles and miles out of my way to shop elsewhere and keep my blood pressure down.I would give the food 4 stars... Their staff would get 0 stars... So, I feel 2 stars is fair. I love their food and was exited to learn there was one right down the street from Nellis AFB! But, I will not be going back to this location! My order was rang out wrong. I was given an attitude about them forgetting my drink. Then, my sandwich was wrong and I didn't ask them to remark it. I simple asked for the pickles they forgot. I was screamed at because my pickles would come out of the cashiers pay?! Other employees stepped in and apologized but I was already mad at that point. Went back to the table and told my husband we were leaving! The cashier sat right outside the door and took a smoke break. We had to basically climb over her to leave. Then she thought it would be a good idea to call me a b**** as we got into our truck! I'm sorry I asked for pickles I paid for & you forgot my drink... I would have happily paid for the drink but you were busy being rude because you rang everything out separately. Costing me more money... As far as your rude comments,  I'll be adding them to my military wife blog and telling everyone not to bother eating at this location. Sorry Arby's, I love your food but your lack of customer service is horrible!Drop by at lunch time to find out what the fuss is all about. I mean when you got four stars on Yelp, you deserve a check out. Arrived at a real hole in the wall restaurant, meaning lots of holes in the couch and chairs. Absolutely not trying to fix the restaurant at all. Holes all over the place.

Try the lunch buffet. Lots of varieties, all mediocres. Granted I have eaten at some of the most delicious place all over vegas, but that doesnt mean you just stir fry everything and call it a thai restaurant. Tom yam koong warm and no kicks. Pad thai doesnt even taste like pad thai. orange chicken too orangy and sweet. 

All and all, for $6.99 you get a lot for your money. But I prefer quality than quantity. Its probably good for the area, but I rather drive a little and dine at thai style noodle house in spring mountain. One and done for me.I wanted to get my nails done is Vegas without paying Strip prices so I looked up this place and it had pretty decent reviews. Needless to say, i was pretty disappointed. I got Black French tips for $20 which I'll admit is a pretty good price. As for the quality, I wasn't really happy with it. The guy that was working on my nails did not have a steady hand so you can clearly see that the edges of the polish is jagged. Then when he was cutting my cuticle, I don't think he knew what I meant when I said "OUCH". When he was finally done I realized I that 6 of of my 10 fingers were bleeding...pretty bad too. I thought maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad guy, but my friend who was sitting two chairs down from me also had the same complaints. She even got a across her fingertip...although I have no idea how that happened. 

Next time, I plan to stay on the strip rather than go through this pain again.Ate from here last night, woke up in all kinds of pain, it sucked!Probably one of the worst resorts I have been to. The place looks and feels like a 5 star resort, but once you settle you'll notice that your eyes will deceive you. 

We checked in with some amazing staff (which is why I didn't give this place a 1 star) and we walked out the door and were caught up by the timeshare ladies. We ended up signing up and claimed our $100 gift card. We then went to the room. Here's a quick summary of the resort.

PRO's:

 -Decent looking rooms
-Decent Customer Service

-CON's:  

-NO Wifi? Are you kidding me? I can stay are a hole in the wall in Tijuana and still get free internet. This is what started me off on the wrong foot. 

-Thin walls/Ceilings: I felt as if we were in a 1980's movie where the old lady bangs the ceiling with a broom stick because the people upstairs are noisy. We actually had to do that! This place was built with the thinnest walls/ceilings I have EVER seen in my LIFE! We heard the people upstairs walking from 3am-6am then house keeping from 8am-12pm. This was ridiculous. Kept a lot of us up at night. 

-The rooms had a smell (we had no idea what kind of smell it was)

-Room remote controlls were dirty and didn't work. (I hope housekeeping actually cleans these things). 

-Showers didn't drain properly

The list could go on and on. The main reason we stayed at this resort was due to the Yelp reviews and the fact that this place had balconies (we have smokers in the family). I would rather stay at an older hotel that is a little closer to the strip as well.

If you are looking to stay here, I would suggest you choose else where."Meh" is exactly right. Was feeling a bit lazy and not wanting to venture out in the middle of the 5 minute storm we'd just had, so I called them for delivery. I ordered potstickers, combination (BBQ pork, chicken and shrimp) chow mein and General Tso's chicken. I asked them to make my chow mein spicy. The potstickers were cold. And apparently their version of  "making my chow mein spicy" is to throw a single red chile pepper in and give me a side of Chinese chile sauce. And while it was spicy after I dumped the chile sauce on it, it remained extremely bland. Actually pretty much tasteless. My husband's General Tso's chicken was decent and I will probably finish it off later after the whole "20 minutes after Chinese food" thing kicks in. The portions were huge, but what does that matter when they don't taste good? The fortune cookies were stale (Or something. I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to be chewy.) Definitely not worth the $26 I spent.Flight was delayed, had prepaid reservation thru carmel in NYC via Las Vegas limo. And they had our flight info on our reservation. Had to call when we got to baggage claim, driver was not there but said he would arrive in 7 minutes at zero level. Asked the airport staff where zero level was, said we were there. Still no driver. Called them again, told them we were in terminal three. They told us to go to zero level again. Asked airport staff where we were and they said terminal three and terminal one is where ground zero. Called them back and told them to cancel our reservation or come to terminal three and pick us up. They agreed to send the driver to terminal three. Finally he showed up. We had asked the Las Vegas limo staff where are car was and they tried telling us our reservation meant nothing. Ignored them and then finally out car came.Had to wait 15-20 minutes for the shuttle to fill, but simply paying the $12 (round trip) fee is so much easier than haggling with some of the limo drivers upon exiting the airport.Kinda shady and is totally dead till way late...Going downhill, food was below average.  Service is ok.Service was good extremely noisy. I ordered a club sandwich with fries and was told they charge 79cents for ranch.  Are they this hard up?I have to start off by saying this restaurant is visually very appealing, but when the food arrives it's like finding out Santa is not real- every time. Seriously, the salsa was so watered down I bet a baby could drink it out of a bottle and not flinch. Super Mex, I want to love you. Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried:
Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish.
Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa!
Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies
Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex
Overall, what is a Mexican restaurant without a decent salsa and guacamole? Simply not a fan, amigo.Just a quick one. The food is pretty good but the service is bad. I have gone 3 times and endured terrible service for the food, every time swearing I won't come back. LOL If you can stand the bad service the food is worth it or maybe not. Coin flip decision at best.If you are looking for real Mexican food don't waste your money here . Roberto's has more authentic and tastier food. Burritos are 75% beans 25%  meat and bland. Spend your money at Casa Don Juan in the downtown area instead. That's probably the best Mexican food that this SoCali girl has found in LV... Cabo at Red Rock is better too...overall Super Mex was Super Disappointing


PS - be prepared to have them take your smartphone to the bar cashier to redeem your groupon... Super Disturbing to have someone take my open phone out of my sight :-/This place is super close to my work so I went there today to enjoy some Tom Yum soup. The person taking the order did not even know what we were ordering so he had to go to the back to see if they make it. Come to find out yes they do so we ordered that and some sweet and sour chicken. When we got our order the Tom Yum soup did not look like what we normally order this one was full of noodles and had no mushrooms but we tried it anyway took a couple bites and that was enough for us yuck. Next was the sweet and sour chicken yuck fried way to long and the chicken was dry. My fried rice was suppose to come out with my chicken but they forgot to make it so I had to eat my chicken and wait for the rice to come out like it was my dessert. When the cook saw the waiter throwing away a whole bowl of soup she was curious why so she asked us. We told her that Tom Yum soup we are use to is not full of noodles come to find out the waiter ordered us the wrong dish!! She made us a new batch of soup to take home I have not tried it yet so we will see. I wish they would not have family helping out that does not know anything about Thai food. WEIRDWe came here for breakfast.. so I can't comment on the lunch menu. The breakfast I make at home is way better. The breakfast menu is so simple it hurts to talk about. The bacon reminded me of my days in the military chow hall or buffet style bacon that sits in a silver container filled with oil. I imagine the lunch side of this deli is where its at, but we eat at so many other lunch spots, I doubt I will ever know..Over priced and not any better than other Chinese places in the area.This buffet was SO confusing. We came here on a holiday and were not impressed. Unlike many of the other buffets that are organized into food categories/generes, this one..isn't. In one place there is cooked pasta...and on the other side of the buffet is the pasta sauce...in one place there is plain hamburgers and 20 feet away is the lettuce, tomatoes and fixings for the hamburgers...it's OFF. The service was pretty much non-existent. I don't even know who our waiter was.Food is like all the pandas, just the service is not good, no bueno, they need to put more attentionWonderful atmosphere.  Great servers.  Really fine guitar player.  The food is very much bland and tastes like something you could cook at home.  I did not get to drink any wine which looks fine and interesting.  Will return but will only order wine and appetizers.From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order. Until recently. I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes. I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak. I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service.Generally I like Jimmy John's quite a bit. The sandwiches, for the price you're paying, plus the speed at which you get them make them ideal for a quick lunch pickup when you're on the run. That being said, when the cleanliness of the establishment is questionable, it makes me think twice about eating there. In the case of this particular Jimmy John's a pervading mildew-like smell hits me every time I walk in this place. If I had to guess, I'd say it was the water/cleaning product solution and the old rags and/or mops they use to clean the place (or stink up, as the case may be.) The result is a pungent sour smell which permeates then entire shop. Needless to say, I have no interest in eating at a place that smells this bad. Also, in case you're wondering, no, this was not a one-time occurrence. I used to visit this JJ quite often until the smell got so bad it made me lose my desire to ever eat here again.Ahh Detroit, home of the lust-worthy Ford Mustang, incredibly talented rapper Eminem, and sweet sweet old Motown music. Do you know what wasn't just on that list??? Pizza, that's what. And after trying Northside Nathan's, I can see why. Now I can come to one of two conclusions after eating there; either Northside Nathan's doesn't accurately represent Detroit style pizza (much the same way that a lot of "New York style" pizzerias in this town bear absolutely no resemblance to real New York pizza), or Detroit needs to stick to manufacturing the vehicles I love to drive, and leave the pizza to the big boys (New York and maybe I guess Chicago). 

The ambiance in this place is easily 3.5 to 4 stars. It's got a really cool decor. The service was also good. The counter girl was friendly and helpful. They also have lots of good promotions going on with coupons all over their website and on the pizza boxes. 

So those were the three redeeming qualities of Northside Nathan's. Unfortunately, after that everything came tumbling down. The crust was far from terrible, it actually was the most decent thing about the pizza. The most apparent problem was that the cheese was of the artificial blend variety. Whatever it was, I guarantee the box it came in didn't read "Whole Milk Mozzarella" or anything of the sort. The "meatball" topping was just that awful, flavorless crumbled ground beef topping. The sauce was barely existent, but maybe that's a good thing, because the little that I could taste was really sub par. I doctored it up with Parm, Red Pepper, Oregano, and Garlic Powder, but as Eminem once said "Nurse, we're losing him. Check the pulse!!" Alas, it was too late to save this terrible pizza. I won't swear off Detroit style pizza for good, but the chances of me returning to Northside Nathan's anytime soon are somewhere between Slim and Shady. 

P.S.- Something I learned from this experience... If a restaurant has a hard time not burning your fries, it probably isn't going to fare too well in the more difficult areas of the food menu.If you need somewhere cheap to stay for a night this place is fine.  I however recently completed an extended stay here and the longer you stay, the more the bloom will be off that rose.  Allow me to explain.

The building is just a wreck.  In no particular order I enjoyed the following "surprises" while there:  Pool closed due to cloudy/green, hot tub broken, fitness room useless due to all equipment broken/vandalized, flooding in hallways, power outages, water dripping from ceiling, A/C in my room basically had two modes (on or off), pet "messes" everywhere, broken elevator, and fire alarms that no one knew how to turn off.  

The clientele also leaves something to be desired.  Not that I'm one to throw stones since I stayed there, but I witnessed several times where someone with dogs got into a shouting/swearing match with someone over excessive barking.  Also "pets" doesn't apparently mean cutesie Paris Hilton puppies oh no - many times there were Rottweilers or pitbulls just walking around NO LEASH.  I have a young son and didn't like that at all.

As for the staff they seemed nice enough but I noticed the longer I stayed the less often my room was cleaned.  At the end I got maid service ONE time in the last two weeks I was there.  Also they got rid of the manager during my stay and he had been pretty responsive to any issues I raised.  

Let's close on a positive note because the cost for this place is pretty low and you DO get free but slow internet, a smattering of cable channels, and a free breakfast featuring waffles, hard boiled eggs, and coffee/juice.  

I'd consider 3 stars for this place if they fixed the issues they can control such as the building issues above and better enforcement of pet policies.  It won't ever be confused for some 5 star hotel and I guess no one expects that, but a lot of what they claimed to offer fell short.This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner.This gym has a TERRIBLE weight/free weight area.  It's dark, dirty, poorly maintained, always crazy busy with huge disgusting men and viking women. Everyone looks like they belong in a prison yard.  
Half the machines don't have pins in them (I've worked out there for a year and this has been a problem for months).  
It shares a parking lot with 20 other businesses, which is ALWAYS crowed.  My membership ends this week and I can not wait to try another gym.

The cardio area is nice, and I hear the women only area is nice.  

I realize this is probably not typical of most Gold's but this one is just the worst.  Don't say I didn't warn you!Love reading the reviews on here.... If your ordering the Kung Pao or Orange Chicken... Let alone cheese puffs.. Then do yourself a favor & just go to Panda Express! This place is close to the house & some what authentic enough to pass for Chinese.  If I don't have the time or energy to get real Chinese from Chinatown... This place works in a pinch!  Yes.. Real Chinese.. Not American Chinese. What I mean by real.. - KJ Kitchen, Cathay House, Bund Shanghai...It's ok I've had better but for the price not bad. Orange chicken was ok, place looked clean, but the resturant was extremely hot inside looks like the had the A/C offLee's on Lake mead is a lot like the forgotten step child in the Lee's family.  I mean the wine selection is terrible at best.  The store is laid out very casual and plain.  It's more like a quick grab liquor depot to just grab your 2 buck chuck or bottle of Absolute and head home.Lee's has always been the place to go over the years but in the last 6 to 8 months we have watched a decline in the amount of staff, customer service and the biggest thing product!  On several occasions we have stopped by to find the one thing we want out of stock.  Not a coincidence because we would try another one of thier stores and same thing.  Last night we discovered Total Wine off of Rampart because they didnt have what we need.  What a great place!  The place was packed and prices were alot lower than Lee's.  Perhaps this is the reason for the dissappointments at Lee's.  Ken needs to step up his game or he's gonna be closing some stores. :(A couple days ago I walked into my garage before work and noticed that there was 2 feet of water on the floor. The water heater had blown it's top and was shooting water like Old Faithful. When I opened the garage door to let the water out, the current grew so strong that it washed me out with it. I went to Lowes to buy a new water heater, and the guy working there was pretty helpful. He told me that there was no delivery charge for the water heater so I was pretty happy. When I was just about to pay, another worker comes up and tells me that there is a $68.00 charge for delivery. It's common to find workers who aren't on the same page here in Summerlin. Summerlin has very incompetent service at most places(and when I say most, I mean ALL). Living in Summerlin is basically like living inside a Special Ed class at a middle school. Well, I then decided to throw the water heater on top of my very small but gas efficient Toyota(the water heater wouldn't fit inside), and drive back home. While I was in the parking lot I got approached by a pretty girl wearing hollister jean shorts and a shirt that looked like it was from Forever 21. I could see her smartphone in the back pocket of her jeans, and she seemed really well groomed... but she asked me for money. I was like: "Are you f*cking joking me? You ain't homeless. Your just too lazy to get a real job!" Then less than like 5 minutes later another f*cking guy comes up to me and tells me that he is a college student who is trying to get donations so that he can pay for tuition because he can't get a student loan. What the f*cking f*ck? I thought Jesus(aka Obama) passed some kind of law that made it mandatory for colleges to give student loans to their students? I was under that perception because all the f*cking college kids who are d*ckriding Obama have been saying that for the last 3 months. Well, I didn't tell this guy to f*ck off, I just told him to vote for Mitt Romney.  

When I took the water heater out of the package I noticed that it did not come with the dielectic nipples, the pressure relief valve, and the f*cking thing had a giant dent in it! I know that dents in your water heater are purely cosmetic, but I payed $400 for a f*cking brand new water heater and I would really expect it to actually look "brand new". Okay, so 2 hours later I finish connecting the water heater to the outlets. This was really f*cking hard on account of the fact that installing a water heater is usually a 2 person job. Picking up that motherf*cking heavy water heater and putting it up on the stand was extremely tough for a kid like me who only weights like 145 lbs. Okay, everything went well and I went back into my house. As I am sitting on my chair in front of my laptop, I notice that my whole house smells like gas. I was like: "HOLY F*CKING SH*T!" and I ran out to shut off the gas. Apparently, these models of water heater they sell at Lowes needs a special nipple to prevent gas from leaking out and causing your f*cking house to blow up. So, I had to go back and forth to the hardware store like 4 times that day to buy the dielectric nipples, the pressure relief valve, the new gas nipple, and a blow torch. I needed the blow torch because when my previous water heater blew up, it destroyed a water pipe with it. 

That day was a f*cking abomination of epic proportions.1st time I went here I lost $500 playing video poker at the bar.  Bartender very nice.  Comped my food and drink.  Next time in I lost $200 and they comped my beer, made me pay for the food but again bartender very nice.  Last time in I won $100, paid for my food and was totally ignored by the bartender.  She actually seemed like she was angry that I won and that it was an inconvenience to make change so I could tip the food waitress.  Too many other options out there to be treated like this.Decided to take the family out to a nice brunch, so we decided to go here. We heard good reviews so we decided to give it a try. The breakdown: Lakeview was great. The service was lagging. Constantly had to remind our server to refill waters. (Even when his section was empty). Appetizers took 30min for salmon tartare and French onion soup. By the time we got our main course we were full on bread and patience. First time here = bad experience. Food overall was ok. There's no definite wow factor.Friday afternoon I purchased two slabs of back ribs at $2.29 per pound.  We decided to smoke ribs on Sunday and when I unwrapped the two slabs of ribs I discovered two slabs trimmed of most of the meat.  Not wanting to serve these ribs to guests, I went to Smiths and purchased two additional slabs for $1.99 per pound.  I cooked all four slabs and found that not only were the John Mull slabs excessively trimmed, but the meat was extremely tough and seemed like commercial or utility grade beef rather than any consumer grade.  After ten years of periodic patronage (mainly because they are about a mile from my house) I will drive a bit further and go to Larry's.

Their staff has always been friendly and I cannot rate their new hot foods as I have not tried any.I'm a Texas girl and was having the craving for some BBQ, in all the years I've lived here (over 20) I have never had any BBQ in this city that can come close to the best BBQ which in my humble opinion is from Texas. So I jumped on yelp to see what was out there, maybe just maybe there's a hidden gem in the city of sin. So after reading some reviews we decided to check out the road kill grill. The name alone sounds interesting, and it was featured on the food network.....so I'm not gonna lie we got a little giddy. Driving up it was very cool, it's ranch style setting, you eat outside on picnic tables and they are smoking the meat out there. It gives you that vibe of family reunion or family gathering on a Sunday afternoon, I dug that. Now the first red flag was they are smokin the meat outside but there was no delicious aroma of meat smokin in the air. I wanna smell that meat smokin, it gets my mouth goin! So the husband orders what he always gets when we eat BBQ..... Brisket sandwich. I decide to try something different so I ordered a plate of chicken with green beans and Mac and cheese. So we'll start off with the brisket sandwich. The brisket didn't look like brisket. Brisket should be brown and crispy on the outside and pink towards the center. It should melt in your mouth and flake apart. The brisket looked nothing like that, it looked as though they had boiled it, not smoked it. When he opened the styrofoam container that held his sandwich I thought they messed up on his order and gave him pork, because the meat looked like pork not brisket. There were no pickles, no mustard, and no onions which are what make a brisket sandwich. The BBQ sauce they provided for dipping I will say was delicious. Now onto the chicken. That was delicious, very moist and very juicy. The flavoring was excellent, and I think should be considered their best item. The green beans were full of flavor and scarfed up immediately. The Mac and cheese was really good as well, it was baked and didn't have an overabundance of cheese. Overall if I could give this place 2 1/2 stars I would, I can't stretch to a 3 just based on the fact that the brisket was so off. I'm still on my quest to find some delicious Texas style BBQ here in the valley. I'm getting kinda tired of having to drive all the way to Phoenix to have Rudy's just so I can have some good BBQ.We were in Vegas visiting family, and wanted to take them out for a nice meal.  My choice was to head over to Ghandi for some take tasty Indian food, but the group's overall palate wasn't up. To that.
We settled on this place because my Sister had heard great things about it.... I figured you couldn't be in business for that long if you sucked....wish I had read the yelp reviews first before dropping almost $300 on second rate food.

Went in at 6 , and were asked if we had a reservation. No, we didn't, considering the (outward) size of the place didn't think we would need them. 
We were given the choice of eating in the lounge...I'm ok with that,in fact I believe you can usually get better service in lounges/bars.

Our server was efficient and friendly, if not a bit aloof.  That was pretty much as good as it was going to get.
Food was Sizzler quality,at best.  MY rare prime rib was med_well. Wife's food was cold,, mushroom on her special not even cooked. Our server did get her a new mushroom for her filet, which was also overcooked. . The appetizers (scampi and crab cakes) were amusing,in an amateur chef kind of way. 

The rest of the group's meals kept the same,low standards... burnt baked potato, etc.  To add insult to injury, I was charged for 2 extra pieces of bread....classy.
No manager presence to be seen until on our way out the door...

Our server did her best, and was friendly, but Decent service will never compensate for second rate food.
Moral of the story: don't waste your time or money.OMG, what is up with this company?  I saw a blood drive sign at work and said to myself "Why not?  It's been a long time."  What in the hell did I get myself into?  

At the drive, they couldn't get my blood pressure and I was told by law they could only try twice.  Okay no problem I'll try again the next day.  Went in as a walk in, same thing, couldn't get my pressure.  Well I guess the two try rule went out the window as they checked my arm over and over again.  I even took my shirt off so they could try bare skin.  They left scratches and bruises on my arm then finally gave up.  

I made an appointment for the next available day.  (I guess I was feeling guilty for not having a heartbeat.)  I got two e-mail reminders and a phone call to let me know I had an appointment.  (It was only one day apart.)  The lady that interviewed me took my blood pressure on my lower arm and got it on the first try.  They really pushed the double red cell donation and I said it would be okay.  It made me feel like crap all the next day, all I did was sleep.

 The next day I get a call asking why I missed my appointment.  Now they are calling me again, two days later.  They got their damn blood and I feel like I'm being stalked.  Now I'm getting a reminder of why I stopped giving in the first place.  Now, if your a blood donor please keep donating, but for me I think I'm done.Horrible customer service. We stayed at the Tropicana and they said they'd pick us up at "Entrance 5", well with the construction it's closed so someone with this tour company told us to ask the front desk where to go (they said all buses have been redirected to the front). At 9:35 we called to see where the bus was (as our tickets told us to do) and we were told we HAD to go to entrance 5, so we walked around the construction. Once we got there (less than a few minutes) we called again and they said "Sorry, she already left, you'll have to take a taxi!" So much for hotel pick up! We took a taxi and they reimbursed half of what it cost! If our tour guide hadn't of been so nice the experience would have been completely ruined, I didn't catch her name but she was a contract worker (they don't have any of their own buses or drivers). I will be booking elsewhere for any other tours!I had only ever been through the drive-thru at this location and it was as you would expect from a drive-thru.  Not much customer service to speak of.  Going inside I would expect better that involves more face to face interaction.  Customer service is severely lacking at this location.  The lady taking orders made me feel like I was being an inconvenience.  Excuse me for being a paying customer and therefore a part of your salary, lady.  After I placed my order she threw all my food into a box and handed it over to me before I could even give her my money.  Obviously the food was not fresh though it was very hot.  After I sat down I could hear the staff arguing amongst themselves in the kitchen.  It is unprofessional to do so within earshot of customers.  Sad to see the lack of respect for ones job and customers.I'm just reviewing the tour company not the actual dam tour. After reading other reviews I booked this hoping not to get Steve the bus driver. 
Oh man!! Our bus was driven by Steve & he is obviously not a great pick to operate a tour. He constantly coughs, snorts & swallows large amounts of phlem while speaking over the mic. I thought I was going to get ill. 
On top of the congestion he talks so fast the sentences all get slurred together & you can only pick up on certain words.

I just closed my eyes & tried to zone out on the ride there so wouldn't have to hear Steve talk. 

I really wish I had just spent $20-$30 more & booked a better company.I had a gel manicure groupon. Came in early to look at nail color swatch and decide on a color. When I arrived I was informed my nail tech was running 15 minutes late... I said it wasn't a big deal because I wanted to look at colors anyways. The woman at the front desk said that she thinks the color swatch was at the nail tech's station . So I wasn't able to look at it during the 25 minute wait for my appointment. that's 25 minute past my scheduled appointment. 
My nail tech came after 25 minutes and said she was obviously running late. I forgot if she apologized or not....,
Without any offense, the clientele and the staff were more mature and maybe that's why I felt a little out of place. I would rather pay $5 extra for prompt, attentive service, a more fun environment, and friendlier staff.
most  definitely not coming back.Today is the final straw. First I would like to add, I love working out and finding a decent, convenient location to work out at is a plus in my book. That is the only reason why I go to this location. Furthermore, I would like to say, that the staff not all, but mostly, is very fucking rude. The reason why I say (that actually two people), is rude, is because I shouldn't have to put a lot of energy into actually acknowledging my presence. "Such as saying hello". 

 I'm not the type of person that really feeds into negative people's energy normally but when you're having a bad day and someone is working in customer service, the last thing you expect is bad customer service in a customer service field. 

 One in particular, this "girl", not a grown woman, always has an attitude.  A few months ago, I actually engaged into making a conversation with her. Just so I knew, that maybe it wasn't me that she always had an attitude with or thinking it it was something that I did to her. And even then, she acted like she had an attitude, like she didn't want to be bothered. Her excuse was as I was being cordial with her, "are you having a bad day" and in response "I'm just a little tired". So I said to myself, okay just let it roll off. 

  But then everyday after that the same cold nonresponsive attitude. She doesn't even say hello at all she looks the other way or looks down. Then I started noticing some others that she worked with acting the same way. (As if they had a little click against me.) 

  Like I said before I'm a very laid-back, and I just kind of keep to myself. So I don't understand what's going on at this location. So if anybody experiences the same thing, please let me know. I don't like taking things personal but it's a shame that I have to go to a different location where people actually have common decency and respect for each other at a different location. 

I gave this two stars because, a person can really make or break the environment with their attitude and energy. The place can be in immaculate shape and clean and all that. Which this place isn't always clean and decent and I pretty much ignore it. But the energy here, always weighs me down at this place. Then you start noticing when people, like to shit literally, in the showers and other things that isn't wiped down properly, etc.

So there you go. My epic review and all truth. Good luck to all.1st off I was in between 1 and 3 stars.  Hence the 2!
I arrived at the course all excited to play.  My group and I had a tee time at 9:30.  
We arrived at 8:45 with the intention of using their practice facility and putting green to warm up.  Well we walk into the clubhouse to check in and the employee informs me that my tee time got cancelled.  With a dumbfounded look on my face I ask WHAT? 
 They said "yes, I don't know what happened but your time was cancelled and filled with somebody else."
I ask "How can that be?"
Response "I don't know"?
ME: well what can we do about this
Response: We can try and send you out at 10:50?
ME: No that won't work because we have other plans and had a tee time at 9:30.  This screw up is not our fault.
Response: Well let me see.  It looks like someone called in to cancel.  
ME; HUH??, dumbfounded look???
Response: Well, I don't know what to tell you.  It's either 10;50 or later.  We're really booked up.
ME: This is a real inconvenience.  It is the mistake of the golf course and somebody that works here.  How are you going to make this right?
Response:  After looking, We can send you out right now.  But that's all we can do.  

Not wanting to wait over 2 hours to play a round that should've started 45 minutes from the time we arrived at the course, my party and I reluctantly agreed.  It made our front 9 horrible because of no warm up or practice time.  They took a little off our green fee to try and make up for the inconvenience but everything should've been handled way better.  The course wasn't even in the best condition.  When I saw it on Big Break, the greens and fairways looked completely different.     Very Upsetting!five hour wait after making "appointment" on line.  Stuck in an isolation room for no reason, I came in in pain.  go somewhere else.Qualifier':  I stopped using chopsticks when I was 9, except for Sushi. Born and raised in San Francisco from a restaurant family, so I've eaten Chinese food for 46 years. 
Went KJ's because of good reviews on Yelp and it was my initials! in the name. Krishna Jon

For me, a sure tell, bench mark of a spot is Beef Chow Fun, Black Bean Sauce, Wet. That's what I ordered and got:
Watery sauce, Onion and Bell Pepper, Low grade beef. One of those I ate it, but wouldn't order it again things. It was fresh, to it's credit. Some of things on the menu look intriguing, ( deer meat clay pot! ) and some of the things mentioned in the other reviews looked nice too. But the dirt factor.

In response to one the reviews, My Chinese friends have a saying about dirty restaurants too. Nasty. The one fish tank was cloudy, the spot was greasy and the bathrooms, yuck! 

You can get good, authentic Chinese food in a clean place, But don't get me wrong, I have a warm place in my heart for the greasy spoon, Chinese, American or otherwise. If you are ever in The City, try Canton on Folsom for my lowest acceptable standard on the Greasy spoon, great food! Or Tong Kiang for quality and clean class on the authentic tip. Would go back to KJ only if somebody took me there, late at night.Went to KJ on Christmas eve at about 5 p.m. and there was an hour's wait already!  We decided to wait 'cos it would be the same every where in Chinatown and we read so many good review on Yelp.

We finally got our table and ordered our food.  The house soup came first (this is free).  It was your usual pork bone soup with carrots and winter melon.  Refreshing.  We ordered Green Beans with minced pork (good), Steamed Flounder with ginger and garlic soya sauce (quite good), Oxtail (could be braised longer), Beef with mushrooms (different types of mushrooms - quite tasty).  Service was attentive.  It sure was hard to eat when people are in the lineup staring at you and waiting for you to finish that last morsel in your bowl so that they can take our table.  

I've had better Chinese food.The food here does not meet our expecation for Thai food. Their BBQ chicken smell so bad, the worst BBQ Thai chicken I have eaten. The place is very small, and service is so so. Not recommend for anyone!Stopped by yesterday for lunch. Ordered hummus and pita to start, pretty yummy. Had the grilled mahi tacos and the lettuce and salsa was all that you taste. Very little mahi mahi. I was bummed because I ordered these in the past and I don't remember them being stuffed with all that lettuce. Seriously, not very good. My daughter ordered the cheese pizza. She told me it was spicy. At first I didn't believe her, so I tried it.  To my shock, the pizza sauce was spicy. A little odd for a kids pizza. I'll return, I'll just order differently.Being in Vegas with 3 other lads we decided not to break from stereotype and pop in here to get something to eat, so I can't comment on the Hotel itself or the gambling.

The whole casino is done out in the typical Hooters style (i.e. barn like) the ceiling is very low and the place felt kinda small and cramped in comparison to other casinos.

We had to queue for about 30mins to get seated, this was despite the fact there were at least 4 or 5 tables free at anyone time whilst we were in the queue.  When we did get to the front of the queue the waitress stood right in front of us, ignored us for 5mins whilst she had a conversation with another waitress about their boyfriends.  In general the service was awful and the chicken wings we ordered turned up cold.  Otherwise the food was "ok" and our waitress (once seated) was enthusiastic if perhaps a little irritating.

Wouldn't bother going again.Don't bother going to this Hooters for the food. Only go if you are going for the whole "Delightfully Tacky" theme and even then the dealers in the casino are way better looking then the servers. So  I guess save your money for gambling and wait until midnight to eat 25 cent Hooters wings at Dan Marino's.Half of a star because this hotel is a dump. Half of a star because the hotel rooms come with that Hooter's orange colored lampshades, and that is kinda cool. Another star because I looked down from our window and saw that the hotel's pool had a waterfall and a big sandbox area. HAHA.

Part of me wants to give this place the benefit of the doubt because we did, in fact, cram 12 people into one standard hotel room. That's right, 4 people in the two beds, 8 people on the floor. The second night, two of our friends got a seperate room and said it was a million times better and cleaner. It might have been the lack of 10 other smelly drunk people around.

The room:
- The toilet broke the very first time it was used.

- On the back of our door, written in permanent marker read "I'M WATCHING YOU :)"  uh.

- Mysterious basketball-sized red stain in the corner of the room.

- They actually have a little ad thing on the dresser between the beds that starts out in big print, "Do you REALLY need clean sheets.....?" followed by a description about how you shouldn't request to have clean sheets unless you really, really need them. As if any hotel's sheets aren't disgusting and questionable enough, the classy establishment that is Hooters is asking me to drunkenly pass out on some previously sexed-up vomit bed? Pass. (I ended up doing it anyway)

-NO HOOTERS STATIONARY. Wtf am I supposed to steal for a souvenier? I just want a Hooters pen, god.

The actual hotel:
- The elevator is the scariest elevator I've ever been on. And smells of burning rubber. And sounds like you're about to die. Squeeling elevator noises and shaking = bad.

- I got so lost just trying to get the fuck out of there and onto the strip.

- I didn't eat at the restaurant, but some of our friends did and said it was disgusting (coming from growing young dudes who will eat anything)

- The Hooters girls don't have hooters. I'm a girl and even I was a little appauled by this. They're just right-outta-high-school uggos that need a job. Lame. Have some dignity and get a boob job.

-Really creepy old men everywhere. Like, EVERYWHERE.

So yeah. No thanks, Hooters. No thanks.The parking garage is an omen to the rest of the hotel & casino; bad.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the old school properties like Golden Nugget & 4 Queens.  They offer a classic old school Vegas feel and usually have excellent deals on food, entertainment.  Alas, Hooters is basically like taking all the bad qualities of a downtown hotel and putting on the strip.Let me start this off by saying a pregnant girl working at hooters is kind of weird. Well at least that's what my group of friends decided.

We only came here because we have never been and we both love buffalo wings. We stood in line and waited a good 20 mins to be seated. We immediately ordered our wings and ice tea, The tea arrived quickly, the wings however did not. I started to wonder if they were chasing the little chicks around demanding their wings in the fryer. I knew this wasn't the case because it was an open kitchen. They were just slow, and slow might even be an understatement. 

Wings came out a good 35 to 40 mins later, cold of course. Nothing special about hooters wings.  The sauce sucked, no kick at all. It really could have used some butter. The blue cheese dipping sauce came out of a peel away packet. The color was off...not sure what was going on there. 

I will never return.Ugh. The friendly staff gets four stars but the building is atrocious. Decor is beyond tacky, elevators are scary, and the whole place needs an upgrade badly. Yeah, sure its cheap and not the MGM but the only reasons that I can think of anyone wanting to stay here is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while gambling. At least the rooms don't seem to have bedbugs.On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. 

My feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. 

I'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings.Very Plain and nothing exciting. Don't waist your time doing the $100 free slot play sign up promotion.I should have listened to all the reviews and stayed away from here. Here are my pros (few) and cons (several):

Cons:
-They don't sell the $1.50 Bud Lights here.
-There was not a blonde, large-breasted waitress in sight. Honestly they all looked like they were fresh out of high school.
-Service was definitely lacking. Asked for a water and didn't receive it and had to ask again.
-Food was super bland. The wings were not "hot" by any means.
-There was a line out the door and it took forever to be seated, even though there were two hostesses and several open tables.

Pros:
-To be honest, I can't even think of one. I was expecting so much more from the Hooters in the Hooters casino.

Save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere.Bad #1 Check-in.  had no idea how to enter our reservations in computer,  so we could get our vouchers for free breakfast and so we never got it.   #2 Dirty halls and unmaintained guest rooms. #3 Different drink prices thru same hotel all run by hooters. #4 No free internet. #5 One pool is ice cold. #6 Does not follow up on complaints. #7 No one wins at slot machines. #8 Ghetto towels for pool so you don't steal them. #9. Parking garage is just filthy. #10.  There is no manager it just runs itself!

Good #1 Security.  #2 Price of room when on special. # 3 Good music outside at the one heated pool. #4 Lots of Hooter girls #5 Onion restaurant specials and service  Note: Will probably never go back. Worth the extra money to go elsewhere.So I Decided To Take A Summer Trip To Vegas With A Few Friends..We Decided On Hooters Because It Would Only Be $75 For 4 Days Which Is Cheap Considering Im Not Gonna Be In The Room Anyways But To Shower And Maybe Sleep. We Checked In Were Greeted By Marcos At The Check In Desk I Gave Him My ID And Card Be Proceeded To Tell Me It Would Be A $300 Deposit Plus $11/ Day Resort Fee. I Didnt Know About A Deposit And Refused To Pay It After Arguing I Got To Only Put Down A $100 Deposit. We Get The Room Keys And Were On The Ninth Floor And It Was Right Next To The Elevators So You Can Hear Them Coming Up And Down All Night..The Room Was Clean The Beds Were Comfortable The Pool Is Awesome The Downfall Was The Deposit And Rude Customer Service..I Wouldnt Come AgainThe sales guys, Wayne and Rob, were both really friendly, very easy to talk to. I was a little disappointed with the over all experience though as there were two vehicles, exactly the same 2011 GMC Terrains, same equipment, both within $500 of each other. When I came in to finish the paperwork, one had been dropped to $17,998, from $22,500. So I chose that one instead, as they remained firm on the price of my original choice $22,998. I was told that the mark down was a mistake, but they would honor it. The very next day the price of my original choice went down to $17,998 as well. Which I found out when I had to drive back down to sign additional paperwork, Certified certificate (?) the very next day. Frustrating, but I get it, but if they would have been more flexible on the price of my original choice, I would have paid more than $17,998 and taken it, since it had less miles. By the way, my original choice is still sitting on the lot, even at $17,998. 
When I went to take it on my very first trip, my dad checked the oil for me, and we were both puzzled over the fact that there didn't seem to be any oil in the car. So I took it to a shop that was close to where I was purchasing gas, because although I am NOT a mechanic I do know that engines are supposed to have oil, the mechanic at that shop was super friendly and confirmed that the engine was about a quart low. I watched him pout another quart of oil into the CERTIFIED VEHICLE that I had had for just over ONE WEEK!
Then the coup de grace, I went to the DMV on Monday, 2/10/14, (my only day off this week), and spent 4.5 hours waiting (I get it, that's NOT AutoNations fault :-), when my number was up I sat down at the window, started to go over the paperwork, and was informed that the smog had expired the WEEK BEFORE! She told me there was nothing that she could do, and told me that I would have to come back the next day. On the way home I called Wayne and told him what had happened, explaining the situation in full as my temp registration was expiring on the 11th, he was great, told me to bring the car back down anytime and they would smog it for me and go to the DMV for me. GREAT!! Great customer service and service recovery. I took the car to my parents, as I can't just take time off to spend at the dealer or DMV. I called the next morning, yesterday as it happens, and spoke to Steven, who said that I would have to wait for Rob to get in at Noon because he wasn't aware of what they had worked out (good thing I didn't take the day off). So my parents took the car in after noon and they smogged it, but then said that they would not be able to go to the DMV in time and that we would have to go BACK TO THE DMV. My dad didn't want to let the temp expire so he spent the rest of his day at the DMV. It's bad enough that I had to ask them to go down and get it smogged, but then for him to have to spend his day at the DMV was ridiculous! He's retired but his time, anyones time, is more valuable than that, in light that it was a simple mistake that could have been caught and rectified prior to me driving off any one of the times that I was down there.  

So, while I have recommended the Terrain, it's great (now that it has oil), I would hesitate to recommend AutoNation. You're people are great, but you're processes, quite frankly, suck. 

Thank you for your time! 
GabiNeed a good laugh?  Go into Ritzy Rags, engage the owner in conversation and then plunk on her that you just love going to "junk" stores and pick up items (whatever? Gucci purses, Fendi scarves, Prada wallets, etc.), too. Better yet, tell her you shop Goodwill all the time.  She will fume so much that the frost starts to grow over the whole store.  It's a hoot!!!!
OK stuff, tho.  Just who wants to pay $400 for an obviously dry cleaned more than a few times Escada sweater coat?  Too high for the quality.OK, so this wasn't exactly a gourmet experience, but I just needed to have some pancakes. This restaurant is a Northwest chain that has expanded through much of the U.S. I got bacon pancakes (i.e., bacon inside the pancakes) and a side order of sausage patties. The pancakes were heavy, the sausage not bad.

Too bad I didn't check here first - perhaps the house specialties (apple pancake or Dutch baby) are the way to go.Once upon a time it was really good, but the food seems too oily for me. 

I do really like the salt & pepper crab legs, but you must go there early to make sure they don't run out. 

Great price but you get full very fast....This place has ruin its reputation faster than Tiger Woods. When I came here a while back, I remember reviews being positive but I had my doubts. 

After tasting the pho, I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful. The broth and noodles were flavorless. The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot.

The only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request. I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water. Water or some other drink should be given when  you sit down with your menu. The waiter just couldn't remember a cup of water, and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant. I'm surprised he actually got the right order.

There are a bunch of other places on Spring Mountain, try one of those instead.well lats nght I did not fell like cooking so I ordered pizza. the comercials on TV had been haunting me for moths with thoese" Pa- Zones things" They looked good on TV but when they arived at mt house the sise was something a bit larger than A hot pocket. I had the italian meat and the buffalo they were good dont get me wrong, but i guess I got what I payed for when they are only two for five dollars. The new item pizza rollers witch you recived four per order for five dollars had pepperonni in side witch was nice. the cheese sticks how ever my dog if I had one would not even eat  not good card board yo do not get this joke of a cheese stick no real cheese just crust and powdered cheese. 

the food did come it a speedy 20 min or so, when the gut pulled out the two small boxes i thought it was a joke. next time I will just get a good extra large pizza nto from these guys. fell sucker to the smell o vision again.It's been awhile since we last came to this location because they were always screwing up our orders. But being that we were babysitting and not in the mood to cook-fast-food became the obvious choice for lunch. Since we had previous issues with missing items or incorrect orders we decided to go in an order. The only special thing I asked was NO SOUR CREAM on the Fully Loaded Nachos, BUT do you think that would get right. 1st I didn't even get the Nachos, and when I did mention it they came out with a huge glob of Sour Cream just staring me in the face. I like so many others am completely reluctant to complain about food and have it redone or sent back in fear of it being defiled or spit on-Who hasn't watched "Waiting..."? So I just scooped off the SC myself and fed the hungry monsters. The food was all there but it is so disgusting with meat substance they call beef and all the DAMN beans on everything. Who the hell eats Nachos with beans-I always thought it was chips and cheese maybe add some onions,tomatoes and cilantro. All the damn beans make the chips all soggy. Why is it that the taco salad shell is so light & crispy-the best one I've eaten-but they don't use it for their tacos,etc.? I will say it was rather inexpensive $20 for 4 people but it was not Mexican food by any means. I'm not even sure what they meat like substance is they use but it is surely not any kind of beef I've ever made. This location is the same as any other-it's just Taco Bell in general that sucks!!!Just ok. The cheese curds are delicious. The beer is just average. The pretzel is  not a pretzel, it's bread with salt on it, shaped like a pretzel.Wasn't really planning on Dim Sum in Vegas but dad wanted to try the dim sum in this county so I was like ehhh okay....he even bought with him a Chinese newspaper that listed some Asian restaurants in the area...therefore we ended up in this restaurant for dim sum. The place was easy to find....pretty much all the Asian restaurants are located near or on Spring Mountain Rd. This is a small dinky restaurant but I was surprised by the hours they are opened - from 10:30 am to 5 am 7 days a week....I figure they don't make much money. We got there just 30 minutes after opening and it was quite and there were already some patrons.

They have the dim sum carts here not the ones you order on a paper so that was good. The food, in my opinion was pretty bad....the lady was telling us the food is fresh and just came out but it was warm instead of steaming hot. The skin of the rice rolls were too thick and the sui mai and beef balls lacked taste. The only dish I liked was the Shredded pork and thousand year old egg porridge...that was hot and just the right texture. The Sticky Rice with Chicken was okay but there was more radishes in the beef tendon bowl then there were beef tendons. 

The selection of food was meager and not a lot of unique dim sum choices but that was expected I guess. The service was eh...they weren't busy but took a long time for them to refill our tea pots. By the time we left, they got a few more diners. This place was pretty weak - but eh I really didn't expect much in the first place.The food is cheaper than the strip. But it is for the low quality food.
When we arrived, there were many people at the door. But there were still many empty tables. I would give them 1 star for the service. 
I ordered goat hot pot (), Vegetable beef () and hong kong style sweet and sour spare ribs (). All of them are salty. There could be some extra MSG. After the meal, I was so thirsty. I had to drink 2 bottles of water. The food quality is way below the average. 
I give them 2 stars to acknowledge their low price for a restaurant  But the rest are disappointed. It is better to go to chinese food session in the cheap buffet or go to panda express.Sadly I think this place has seen its Golden years and they are long gone. I remember going to this carwash for years, with my grandma, my mom and dad and later myself. In this time this place has weathered over the years and now needs a major overhaul. I believe the carwash has changed owners and it seems they are trying everything to make a buck. They recently added window tinting and smog checks. They wash prices have remained pretty solid and they recently added (or advertise it more) a detail special for $89. The thing that truly upsets me about this carwash is the fact that they no longer allow you to add a tip for the detailer to your receipt or the option for cash back when paying with a credit or debit card. Now there is an ATM conveniently located in the lobby that charges $2.50 plus we all have those pesky non ATM fees our banks charge. So when I pay $2.50 at their ATM (cause the operator gets a kickback from the owner) and my $2.50 NON ATM fee at my bank my wash has now cost me an additional $5.00 so that I can tip the detailer cleaning my car. To me this doesn't seem like good business. Overall the washes are ok but not consistent as no one does a quality check after the detailer is finished. Bottom-line; this is an ok place to grab a quick wash but bring that cash otherwise you can end up paying more.Rex is sentimental...if nothing else. Which of course as you know...makes Rex nothing else. One thing Rex loves is when old friends meet new friends.  Old Friend, sleeping off a bleach/ammonia high in a dumpster...meet New Friend...waking in the dumpster and finding an unused Groupon coupon. The sun was hot. The dumpster, or as I calling my "mobile home", was even hotter. The bad thing about "mobile homes" is that they are dirty, lumpy and usually smell like Kirstie Alley's bellybutton. The good thing is that sometimes you can meet someone and have a little...rendezvous. Guys...and I guess girls...if you meet a girl in a dumpster...there is a very good chance she is dead or easy...or both. Sometimes you might be tempted to hang in there if you realize that you are sharing it with a hooker who has a hacking cough. Don't. There are plenty of "mobile homes" out there.  TB and an empty wallet sucks.

So obviously some rich bastard who has things like a home, indoor plumbing and a vacuum that will vacuum the floors on its own just through out this little piece of gold like he does his underwear with holes in it. (which by the way...found a "gently" used pair of underwear. nice.)  Anyway, I was able to purchase 20 dollars of food from the Nevada Chicken Cafe. I started off on my long walk to what could potentially be...chicken nirvana.  I was about 2.3 miles away.  I got there 5 days later. It all started when I tried to walk an old lady across the street...and then...well...lets just say that it went wrong.  I did think that Scottsdale was nice.

When I did arrive at the Nevada Chicken Cafe, a lovely Dutchman pulled me the last 30 miles on a sled. (Long story...but you will always pay your debts to Rex...and Rex knows his Mel's Diner trivia.)  When Rex pulled up he was immediately struck by the smell. It was amazing. They had an outside grill/smoker going on and it was impressive. The chicken, ribs, spices, mesquite, all made me want to go in and order as much as I could. 

Rex forced the Dutchman to order one whole chicken, one half chicken, a side of salad and it came with some BBQ sauce and tortillas. The tortillas were gratis. Gracias for the gratis. Rex found an empty mobile home and sat down with my feast. I was starving. Grave robbing is a lot more difficult than you would think. What is even more difficult is finding a landlord that will take a burial dress and skull in lieu of payment. Trust me...in Scottsdale no one has the kind of loot Princess Diana's had...not that Rex would know...anyway...

...for the equivalent of 21.50 Rex was well fed. Rex fed well for 2 meals.  The chicken was excellent. The mesquite was subtle but flavorful. It didn't overpower the meat and was really good. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Rex doesn't like an overly sweet sauce and this one isn't. It is well balanced and not too overpowering on the chicken. it works with the plain chicken better than the mesquite rubbed.  Rex was so impressed he has gone back several times and tried the ribs and some other sides.  The baby back ribs are among the best ribs in Las Vegas. They are fall off the bone and the extremely flavorful.  The St. Louis ribs are good, but they aren't great. Rex didn't love that it wasn't sauced enough. The sauce is sweeter and that is fine, but St. Louis ribs should be HEAVILY sauced...and these aren't. 

The chicken...well...when done right it is the best. It is a excellent piece of chicken. The problem is that there is no consistency. Rex has had dry pieces and he has had perfect pieces...and this is a MAJOR issue. If you are only doing a few things they have to be perfect. In fairness I have had more good than bad...but I have had enough bad to not necessarily want the crap shoot when I am paying good grave robbing money. 

The sides are were everything falls apart.  The Mac and Cheese...and Rex loves the mac and cheese...isn't good. Under seasoned (the only thing that is), and mash potatoes are so peppery it is of the charts. Rex loves pepper. He would roll himself in pepper and find a nice salt covered girl to mix with...but this is too much pepper. The fruit salad wasn't cleaned as well (the tough pieces) as it should be, and the mixed veggies were okay, but nothing great.  The black beans were okay, but again nothing to write home about and didn't taste like they were simmered in a rich enough stock. The sweet potatoes were a real stand out and should be eaten as the side. 

A huge special shout out for the garlic ranch sauce...get a few tubs of it. perfect with the chicken and the salad. Amazing taste. 

Rex has dated his fair share of unstable women. It adds a little spice. A little mystery. A little arousal. Eventually no matter how good post release from jail sex can be...it is time to go.  In his eateries Rex demands stability. Consistency. Reliability. Excellence. Rex is all of those things and more.

Spend your money and time on a shrine to Rex. He will spend his money on gas and whores.So I just wanted a salad so I stopped by here after driving by many times....
Just wasn't hungry enough for chicken or ribs...
Got the chicken Caesar salad, pretty safe bet.  Well much to my dismay the romaine was wilting, some leaves were turning orange, the croutons chewy, chicken dry, even tried to dip in BBQ sauce and hot sauce, no help. 
In their defense, it was to go order but still, if salad isn't right now I wonder about the chicken? Ribs? 
I noticed on the walls they had some celebrity photos, maybe if they concentrated on the food more it may be better? 
Well I can't say I been missin anything driving by all the time....
I will still try the grilled chicken, let's see how it goes......

CSuch a love hate with this place. 
It's always cheap place to shop. 
It is a bit unorganized inside.It was my dad's 70th birthday weekend in January. I flew into town to celebrate with our family. My parents don't eat out much, but my mom wanted to plan something grand for my dad's special day and chose Benvenuto. She met with an employee of BV before the big day and spelled out her requests of how she'd like to decorate. The restaurant seemed ready to accommodate.
Unfortunately when we arrived at 4:30, to prep for the party at 5, a baby shower was still in our private back room. They were to have left by 4 but the best excuse we got from the manager was "It's impossible to get a room of 25 ladies to leave." Uhhh, not our problem. But it was - because when no one asked them to leave I ultimately had to speak with their group and politely let them know about our party at 5.
The room was a mess. There was cake on the floor and the room was in shambles. By 4:45 they began to clean up.
All of the careful thought and planning my mom had discussed with BV was forgotten because it was never written down, and her original contact was not there that night. 
In all, the room was clean and decorated by 5:30. We had to detain my dad's friends in the entrance while my mom frantically set things up. She was stressed, my dad was stressed, and it really showed how little this place cared. When my sister asked an employee to vacuum he rolled his eyes at her and said, "Whatever you'd like."

The rest of the night went better and to be fair the food was delicious and everyone had a good time. Our server Michelle was incredibly sweet and nice to us. She didn't even know about the party but seriously saved the day and improved my mom's mood. BV also comp'd two x-large pizza appetizers, which was a nice gesture we appreciated.

But 5 stars goes to Michelle, 4 stars for the food and negative 20 for the stress they gave my family that night.Food was B but service was terrible (D-)!  Took nearly an hour for us to get our food.  Our waitress acted like she just did want to be there and certainly acted like we were a bother to her.  We were super polite and friendly but it didn't matter.  She is clearly in the wrong job.  I gotta say my cajan burger and fries were good - maybe if you sit at the bar you won't have the experience we had?!I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. 

Although the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. 

Whatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate! What a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices!Came here with family for a Friday Night Fish fry. We had a reservation for 5:30 and were seated promptly, although I was the youngest one there by 30 years! Traditional supper club, outdated decor. They make a great old fashioned. The fish was definately frozen and overcooked, chewy and lacking flavor. It was actually hard to cut. Fish should flake, this didn't . It was extreely disappointing. We also ordered cheese curds. They were ok. The cheese wasn't melted so either they wern't cooked enough or sat in a window to die. I woudn't recommend this place to anyone else. 

It did look like they had a beautiful salad bar although for $3 extra, I didn't need it. Our server was wonderful however. She was attentive and the pace of the meal was nice.Ragstock rarely rises above disappointment for me. (Please note that I only shop for clothes and shoes aimed at women, so I can't comment on the aimed-at-men counterparts here.) I have zero interest in the "new clothing/accessories" side of the store-- it's trendy, cheap stuff whose materials and construction are terrible. I know that higher quality materials and sounder construction do not entail better labor practices, but the stuff on this side of the store makes me want to know more about its origins. The used/thrift side isn't usually worth digging through unless you want components for a Halloween costume, an Ugly Christmas Sweater, or denim cutoff hotpants (each in its respective season.) The used clothing seems like the kind sold in bulk by resellers. The vintage clothing leans heavily towards the polyester. I think the only things I've found here are some khaki shorts for a summer job, a nice flowy silk hippie skirt, a lipstick red Wilson's leather blazer (why not?), and a truly wonderful pair of vintage Frye-alikes that singlehandedly raise the score from 1 star to 2. Ugh, I love those boots. They were dead cheap, too. But I've never found their like again in what's otherwise a sea of square-toed stretch pleather.

The downstairs clearance area is full of flammable-looking shiny things, extreme whiskering, printed leggings, etc. 

Like much of the thrift-side clothing, the dressing rooms don't seem particularly clean. I like the Star Trek murals, but the doors to the stalls are way too small. If I were tall I would be making eye contact with the other shoppers as I changed, and that just ain't right.The cap was delish. the barista who made my drink was a rude bitch. If I was an asshole I'd taker dollar back.On a charitable day I might've given Isthmus 3 stars, but I also felt the need to balance out the inflated marks it's gotten so far. Every Madison-size or larger community benefits from having a free, weekly alternative newspaper, and The Isthmus is definitely handy for concert and show listings, farmers' market schedules, restaurant reviews, etc etc. But by and large the content is kinda weak. Bill Lueders occasionally has an interesting article in his watchdog column, also occasionally gets apoplectic about rather trivial issues. The media reviewers (Dean Robbins, Kenneth Burns) are consistently lousy. Every so often there's an interesting feature article. The Isthmus also likes to play up its independence but takes potshots at other local media on a regular basis. 
  I'm glad there's a free weekly in Madison, but I really wish there was a better one than The Isthmus. Madison's an interesting and  dynamic community, and it deserves better.Best cold gyro I ever had.  Unfortunately, I wanted a hot one, full of succulent juicy meats.

Service was fine, lunch rush was over.  I ordered two gyros and a large soda.  I nearly fell over when they said that was going to set me back $16.  Seems a bit pricey to me, but I needed my gyro fix.  

At first I thought it was the ice cold tomoatoes that were making the whole thing seem cold, so I took them all off; unfortunately, it didn't help.  The meat wasn't fresh from the spit; it was taken from a tray on the prep area, but since they were slicing meat when I came in I thought it would be OK.  The meat was tasty enough and so was the tatziki, but the whole thing being completely cold really ruined it for me.This place is the American Gothic of breakfast food and decor, purposefully bland.

If I were to take a guess, this place gets most of its high ratings because of it's proximity to campus/greek row. A quaint place for sorority girls to quell their hangovers with tasteless food while telling stories about last night.I made the mistake of sitting in the lower level -- affectionately called "King Tut's" on their website.  It's made out to be an intimate place to eat, but really it's a llot like eating in your mom's musty basement.  I kept expecting some creepy crawly thing to scutter out from somewhere.  The whole place just felt damp and icky..

The food was just there.... nothing really too exciting -- and I like Mediterranean food!  I'd much rather go to Kabul over on State or any number of places before heading here again.Decent fare. Spicy level was disappointing.Much like the other posters have asserted, the service here is atrocious. The owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant. That has no bearing on my rating though, as I am purely reviewing the food/value. 

I was very disappointed in the entrees and the prices. $10+ for bland pad thai and curries? Really? Add three or four shrimp for $2 more. What a deal. 

The spice level was typical of Americanized asian restaurants. I was expecting more authentic heat based on previous reviewers but 4 stars was very mediocre. So if you like spicy, either go elsewhere or request additional heat to the four stars. 

Pad thai noodles were mainly starch. Little meat or vegetables. Pad lao was akin to the pad thai-- and the squash/coconut curries lacked flavor and protein. I should have expected such based on previous reviews, but I had to try it for myself. Won't be back.Meh...This is the second time I've had ethiopian food, so I'm no expert, but I can tell when food is flavorful or not. Severely lacking in depth of flavor. It was cooked potatoes/lentils/etc on injera. A little bit of curry flavoring? Service wasn't great as we waited for 1 person to run the restaurant....Wouldn't return.Cashier: "S'that it?"
Me: "Yep"

I live right next to the market basket, so I'm there just about every day.  I don't love the place, but they have an okay beer selection and are starting to bring in some of my favorite local treats.  You'll find most things you'd expect from a convenience store, but Pinkus McBride (another neighborhood store) is better stocked and cheaper. 

I usually have either a strange or curt interaction depending on who's working...but, hey, this place is convenient and usually has what I'm looking for.We had heard people who love this place, so we tried it early on in our trip.

I ordered the stuffed mushrooms as my dinner and my dining partner ordered the chicken parmesan.  The soup that came with the parmesan was good, and so was my mango lassi.  

However, after about 30-40 minutes, the waitress brought my mushrooms and apologized that the kitchen lost the order and they were just putting in the chicken parmesan order then.  I ate the mushrooms, which were okay, but my dining partner canceled the chicken parmesan order and ended up having taco bell shortly thereafter.

We never did go back - mistakes happen but it was not a good impression.The food was okay. Neither my friend nor I thought the food was very good. 
The service was terribly slow. It took a long time after we finished our meal to get the check and even longer to pay for it.I used to love going to the Dise, but all the bartenders that made that place awesome are gone! They have been replaced by people that have zero personality! One of the worst being Hannah. Once, I went in and she looked up and saw me and continued to finish texting on her phone and then came over and with absolutely zero friendliness took my order. I ordered a bloody mary(which I know can be a pain to make, but that's what I wanted) and it was horrible! I was pretty sure she did it purposefully so I wouldn't order another-which I didn't!
I miss all the old bartenders and I know I'm not the only one. I've walked by the place on more than one night and it's been dead! Maybe, they'll figure it out and get some of their old loyal customers back!!!Only bar downtown Madison I can think of that has air hockey.  For that it gets a star.So the coffee is good but the staff is incredibly loud and screaming does not make for a relaxing atmosphere at all.Normally, I would give Tornado a pretty high review.  Unfortunately, my husband and I were on the fence between Tornado and another favorite restaurant, and tonight I wish we would have went to the other restaurant.
My husband's family traveled from Europe to visit us and we figured this was the best place in town to go for a fabulous steak dinner.  While everyone else had a good dinner my medium well steak arrived medium rare.  After sending back, and missing eating my dinner with the family, it arrived again, still medium rare.
Instead of sending back for the second time, I had the waiter box so we could make steak and eggs for breakfast tomorrow.
Shockingly, we still had to ask for the dinner to be removed from the check, or at least discounted.  After all, I didn't even get to eat my dinner. 
We received 25% off of a $40 plate and the waiter insisted he had to "fight" for the discount we received.

I'm sorry to say that I am extremely disappointed in the service and food this evening.  Experience is everything and tonight was a disappointing evening to an otherwise exciting family visit.  Next time, we'll go the extra distance for what now is our first choice.This restaurant is very nice on the inside but the Mexican food is definitely not the best I've had.  I don't think I would call this place bad, but there is nothing special or desirable about it.  I would avoid weekends because it gets busy and the food is not as good.Lousy and kind of expensive for the quality of the food.  But it's on State Street, so you can sit outside during the summer and experience some semblance of actual life.Maybe my expectations were a little too high this morning, but even for hangover food, this was a little disappointing. As others have noted, the service was slow. We got a table right away, but it took a long time to get our food. I ordered the bomblet omelet and it came with toast and hash browns. (No one at our table received their toast that was supposed to come with each meal and we had to ask for it. The waiter added it as "an additional order" of toast.) My omelet was pretty plain. I was looking forward to the melted swiss cheese inside of it, which turned out to be processed swiss cheese that had a terrible melted rubber texture. The tomatoes seemed mealy and not fresh. Part of the omelet was undercooked and runny. The hash browns were dry and overcooked. The coffee was awesome, but it would be hard to mess up Just Coffee.

Overall, I would will probably return here for late-night food or for breakfast if everywhere else was full. If you're on Willy Street and have some time to kill for breakfast anyway, go across the street to Lazy Jane's. They're faster, have more delicious food, and are open a 30 minutes later for brunch.While the service here was really nice, the food and flavor fell a bit flat.  My dinner date and I had the hummus, which was rather bland. We also had the Tunisian Stew and Kabobs neither of which were memorable.I was forced to put a large amount of spicy sauce in my dish to get some flavor. The food, admittedly, was not bad just lacked a certain spunk. There are probably a lot of other great places with the same type of food in Madison.Soup was pretty bland and not particularly flavorful. Both chicken and lamb dishes were equally unimpressive. Service was ok. The temperature inside was a bit uncomfortably hot. The whole experience just left me wishing I'd gone down the street and found something else.It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!I was in here often in early May because I needed to get some last minute things before my field research in Costa Rica in mid-May-late-June.

Were it not for the paranoid staff members consistently checking literally every few minutes to make sure I wasn't shoplifting ("Do you need any help?" = retail-fu for, "I'm checking to make sure you're not stealing anything.") or the ridiculously high prices, I probably would've bought more there instead of getting things online.

However, there was a nice sale and I bought some really great breathable pants there that made being in the rainforest so, so much more comfortable.

The products are great, the services and prices not so much. Because I'm not really an outdoorsy person, I don't see myself coming back either.Booked a room a few weeks in advance of our trip through Expedia. Booked and paid for a King Bed Premier Level room for one night. Notice I said paid, very important. When we showed up mid evening, the clerk said "due to availability we moved you to a room with two queens" Uh no. I told her no-go, that we already paid for a certain room and that type of room was expected. She went away for a few minutes then came back and said the best she could do for a King was on the Concourse Level. Then offered to give us dinner or breakfast for free. Whatever, we'll take it. She wasn't apologetic at all, acting like it was not reasonable to expect the room we booked. Had we not already paid for it, I would have cut her some slack. 

The room was OK, clearly the Concourse level has not been updated since the early 80's, but was fine. A/C worked good, hallway a little noisy, but nothing earplugs couldn't handle.

We took the free breakfast, and it was pretty tasty. The french toast was great.

I can see giving them another chance.The man stumbled upon The Comeback In for brunch and really liked it.  When he talked about the different combinations of food and their delicious pancakes I was stoked to try it.  When we finally decided to try it on a Saturday morning I was definitely not as enamored with the place as he was. 

I don't know if I was expecting the place to be different just because I was there for breakfast but this place is totally a bar that is trying its hand at breakfast as well.  I mean I had been there for drinks a few times but I somehow expected a different vibe when we went for breakfast.  My wish was not fulfilled.  Instead I was led to a sticky, lopsided table with a waitress that look like she'd been working there for 45 years.  None of that matters much right? Well it wouldn't if the food was superb.  But it wasn't.

The place is mediocre at best.  They love oil and make you well aware of it.  The first time I visited here I ordered the walleye with toast.  I know that it is not typical breakfast fare but I love me some walleye.  Anyway, got the walleye, tried the walleye, but didn't like the walleye.  It was oily as all get out and one side was burned.  The toast was slathered in butter, yuck.  My over easy eggs were simply just gross.  They were really watery and completely inedible.

But what do you do when you have a meal like that?  You go back to try it again.  I went back to try the pancakes that the man said were the best pancakes he ever had.  I ordered them with the walleye (again), along with the potatoes.  I could go into a long description as to how oily everything was (again) and how the potatoes looked as though they had been stuck in the tread of my tire.  But I wont.  

I don't like this place and I def will not be back.  Not for breakfast anyway!Half the staff is snotty, but the music is sometimes good, as are about half the baked goods and the spanish lattes and white mochas. Icky sandwiches, sadly. Pick off most of the veggies to make them passable. The black and white cookies, however, are a good, cake-like bet.A few of my friends and I were sitting on some chairs outside of this place. One friend bought a bagel from Einstein's and because of how the chairs were set up, we thought the seating was for both places. A waitress came outside and asked if we were going to buy anything and we were a little confused but said no and she said, "well, you can't sit here," extremely rudely. I understand her request however all she had to do was be alittle bit more polite but she was so rude that none of us will ever go there again. Also, it's not like the seating are was packed and they really needed our chairs.eh- location is good and the lunch special is cheap ($8 for two rolls and soup or salad), but you could probably do just as well with grocery store rolls. It's usually busy and can be fun for groups for this reason, but don't expect to be impressed- the unique rolls are expensive and the rest are boring and average.Appetizers were good and at a fair price. Those of us that had hibachi for dinner found that the quality was fine but it was way overpriced!

For a starter of dumplings and a main dish of chicken and shrimp hibachi, my tab was $40. 

I might return to this place if it was half that price.The pizza is okay, but that's really it. This is one of the only places I have available to me that serves Italian food late at night (via web orders), so if you're having a hankering for pasta like I was, just forget about it because this place will not satisfy your craving. I got the spaghetti bolognese delivered and got a brown paper bag soaked in sauce. Inside the container was a tasteless mess...I could barely eat any of it and I'm definitely not a real-picky eater. Maybe their other dishes are good, but I wouldn't count on it...stick to the pizza (it's the only reason I gave it more than 1 star).I'd like to begin by saying that the food was pretty good. The delivery driver was offensive and challenged. Unable to do his job, he called three times because he didn't have a navigation unit, sense of direction or clue where East Johnson St. was.  Apparently his phone was stolen so he didn't have navigation, and he thought I should sympathize for his loss. His poor attitude was the worst part. 

My calzone dripped with grease, but I wasn't going for "healthy" on football Sunday. The tiramisu was a bit dry, but was still tasty.

I'm not sure I can try the place again.I was a little disappointed with Eldorado Grill but definitely plan on going back to give it another chance because it had potential.Tex Tubb's food is better and less expensive.  While the food was presented nicely, I was not impressed with my burrito.  Pretty bland and the whole time I was just wishing I had gone to Tex Tubb's.  Although my margarita did make up some for my disappointment in the food.  Maybe the brunch is better here, but I definitely would not go back for dinner.I used to love this place.  In high school we went here for homecoming dinners and such, but now? I don't know what happened but my bf and I went there recently and the food was mediocre, service was slow, and all I could think was that I've had better italian from a frozen box.  I wouldn't spend that much money on that kind of food again anytime soon.  My boyfriends chicken with his meal was unbelievably small and pathetic, and it was a chicken based dish.  I wish it was what I remembered from high school, they used to have much better food.Well, now I know why coffee snobs (like me) have nicknamed them "Charbucks." Horribly overroasted beans make the coffee taste awful and burnt.

So, why two stars? Well, for the service! It's awesome...seriously. The employees here are great, even if they have to deal with making coffee from super-crappy, stale beans.

If I'm in a pinch and have to choose between these guys and the horrendous Espresso Royale across the street? I'm going with Starbucks every time. Nice employees will always make me spend my money over an annoying hipster who can't brew a cup of joe worth a damn.We checked this store out after we got back from Japan. We wanted to find some specific ingredients.  The proprietor was downright rude to us and unpleasant, as if she did not want us in the store since we were not regular customers.  Maybe she was just in a terrible mood or something, but we will never go back,Too expen$$$ive for breakfast.

Pancakes are pretty good.  I've had better.  Their hash browns are excellent, but $5 for some hash browns and cheese.  Ouch....
The options on the menu are somewhat limited.  Most breakfast places have an option for something with eggs, hash browns, pancakes/french toast, and meat.  It seems like you have to order everything separately here.  The sausage was good, not great.  The orange juice was definitely fresh squeezed.  It should be more like $$ for price.  There were 2 of us and when we were done, our bill was over $30.  Definitely not a cheap place to eat breakfast (which should be the cheapest meal of the day).Definitely a mixed crowd as stated before.  Decent food, a nice place to watch the game that is on that day.  Not a place where I am a regular, but there seem to be the same faces every time I walk by...weird. 2 stars.Sa-Bai Thong started out as one of my favorite places.   But over time their dishes became more and more underwhelming.  Now the last time I had the duck it was quite good and the ginger tea is very good too.
Then we took a relative of ours who loves Thai food and he was actually upset with their lack of spice.  He said that it was not Thai when we left.
Their service has always been slow and this gets old over time so we have gone elsewhere for quite a long time now and don't expect to go back until we hear that they have improved their food and service.I love Thai food and Sa-Bai Thong has been one of my favorites since I moved to Madison in 2004. I have ordered delivery from them multiple times a month, and typically order the exact same thing. The food is good, though it's never consistent. I've dined at both locations multiple times as well and found the same thing. I order the same thing I always order, but the flavor, spice or overall taste will vary. The staff is friendly, but service tends to be slow - the same applies with delivery
The restaurant has always offered free delivery for orders that are $15 or more and they have now instituted a charge of $2.50 for delivery.  After patronizing this restaurant multiple times a month for many years and despite orders that are less than perfect and lack consistency, I will no longer visit, order delivery or takeout from Sa-Bai Thong. There are other Thai restaurants in Madison and it's time to check them out!The food at Perkin's is consistently terrible.  The breakfast menu is decent but anything refered to as 'dinner' or 'salad' can be safely ignored.

Gets points for being open 24 hours and having a really eclectic mix of drunks at 2:45 AM.I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries at 1230am.  It was me and two groups of 4 people. Service seemed a bit slow for the small crowd of customers. Food was ok. The manager was a bit pushy. I enjoyed free WiFi.mmmmm.....Pokey Sticks at 3am with ranch dressing after a night at the bars- nothing in Madison can beat that. 

Pokey Sticks or Gumby's pizza at any other time of the day or night, however, is just a greasy pile of cheese- definitely nothing special, bordering on bad.I've never tried Gumby's before but I'd like to say -- it's pretty boring. The pizza's sauce, cheese and crust tasted like something out of a cafeteria. The place holds little water in flavors compared to other non-chain pizza joints in the city such as Toppers or Glass Nickel. That said -- it was cheap. My coupon gave me a $5 large cheese pizza and the delivery/ordering process was painless. I guess I can see why this place is open so late as it is not a good "sober food".I had extremely high hopes for this place and was let down. The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the extra $2 charge for the meatballs seems over-the-top. I ordered the Cheef sandwich and my Dad ordered the Philly Cheesesteak but based on our experience they are the exact same sandwich. The Cheef says it comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers...when I asked for both I got charged 49 cents twice for the peppers. The menu says nothing about an extra charge for these items but says you can add them to other sandwiches for a charge. In my experience when it says "comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers" you shouldn't have to pay extra for those peppers. Both of the sandwiches were alright though they came with an ample amount of fillings. Both of the sandwiches came with beef and although there was plenty of the beef it was basically flavorless. The only flavor mine had was from the $1 worth of peppers. The desserts were also very disappointing. The picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade. The tiramisu we got was a frozen, pre-packaged triangle that didn't have much flavor. The two cannolis we got were also pre-packaged and frozen but actually had really good flavor. All-in-all I'm pretty disappointed.

I would consider going back to try the Chicago style hot dogs and their pizza.We recently visited Madison and went to Bluephies for dinner on the recommendation of our innkeeper.  We were disappointed.  The service was attentive, but the food was not very good.  My pasta was OK.  My wife's enchiladas were nearly inedible and hardly even resembled an enchilada.

The atmosphere was noisy and industrial.  The bar drinks were meager pours and over-priced..  All the bottled wines are $30, but the list is over-represented with $7-$9 plonks.I had a hard time deciding between a 1 or 2 star rating.  I went to Bluephies a lot 3 years ago for brunches and lunches and pretty much enjoyed my experience (3-star).  I moved out of the neighborhood and was never inspired to trek up Monroe St after that. However I went last week and the entire experience ranged from average to awful.  

The awful: The menu was short -- but in my experience that's often a good thing.  I chose the peppercorn crusted tuna steak... ack. This dish isn't for peppercorn lovers -- it's for people to like to eat, drink, and wash with peppercorns.  It was just way too much and sort of spoiled the taste of the meat.  My sides were both strongly flavored, over-spiced, and did NOT compliment each other.  (considering my mouth was on fire from chomping down on those little peppercorny-treats)

The okay: The service was attentive, it took a reasonable amount of time for our food to come out, the restaurant was clean. My dining companion rated his black bean burger as average. My dining companion and I appreciated that the drink menu had a few unique local beers on it... they were the best part.I haven't been all that impressed with Bluephies.  The food was fine, but overpriced for what we received.  I think I paid about $14 for a salad with grilled chicken.  The decor was interesting but I wasn't really feeling the ambiance.  I stopped by another time for their famous desserts and was again somewhat disappointed.  The cookie dough egg roll, Oreo ravioli, and Butterfinger wontons didn't live up to expectations.  You can get an edible meal here, but the price-value equation is a little off.A star for service and a star for the dessert. Went for dinner...Food wasn't very impressive at all.  I ordered the black bean and goat cheese enchiladas, but it turned out to be small, soggy, and literally had no trace of goat cheese (not to mention it cost 13 dollars).  I went with a group of friends, and to summarize, the food was mediocre at best.  However, the desserts are amazing.  Bottom line: don't go here to eat, especially if you're on a budget and/or hungry.  Go here for dessert, and take it to go somewhere else.High expectations, complete disappointment.

Bluephies seems to be in the midst of an identity crisis. Stylish dishes that don't live up to the expectations, expensive food in a diner environment, & risky food combinations that completely fail.

Wouldn't recommend eating dinner here but the desserts did look splendid. Unfortunately my group was entirely disappointed in dinner which we had already spent a fortune on, so we skipped dessert.

Nothing we ate was above average, actually the majority of it was inedible.  We ordered a ton of food for our group - the only item I enjoyed out of 8 appetizers and dinners was a hash brown appetizer.  My friends had entire (expensive) meals left at the end of dinner and declined to take their left overs home because the food was just that bad.

Environment... kitsch.  90's style cafeteria-spaceship-coffee shop, certainly trying to be something it is so clearly not.  The food on the menu appears to be sophisticated but the ambiance is the exact opposite.  Lots of families were eating when we went, which meant tons of children running around - not what you expect for such a seemingly elegant and pricey menu.

Way too expensive for the poor quality of food.  Don't be fooled by the promising menu as it completely fails to live up to its mouth-watering nature.  Not likely to go back, unless it's to try their breakfast or dessert.I think my experiences at Bluephies can be summed up as 'underwhelmed'. I kept hearing from people how much they liked it, and when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner her I was excited. I got these chicken enchiladas that were said to come with beans. They were so dry. Dry and flavorless. There was a slight drizzle of sauce that might have helped but it almost looked like a garnish rather than part of the meal. So disappointing.

Since then I've been there twice, once I got a pasta dish, again sub-par and finally for brunch once where I ordered eggs benedict. There are a lot of great brunch places in Madison. Bluephies is not one of them. Again, flavorless. So after 3 visits, trying 3 very different meals I think I can say this restaurant is average at best.

Also - did try a snickers pie when I was there the first time. Pretty much tasted like a brick of cream cheese. Just pass on this place. It's not bad, but it's certainly not good and not worth battling parking on Monroe Street.Not my cup of tea. I got the guacamole burrito, which, albeit is probably not their specialty, was a wrap with lettuce, tomatoes, and gobs of guac. I'm an avocado fiend but this was sorta the pits (see what I did there?). Not big on flavor.I would have to agree with previous reviews in that it's a unique and fun store, but I too have been treated very rudely by employees.  Not only do they sometimes look at you and not say hello, but when you go to purchase something they barely acknowledge you then too.  I've gone back to give them various chances, but they are not exactly warm or inviting unless you are a 50 year old, upper class woman doing some damage.  It's rather unfortunate.I can't tell if the previous reviewers have never shopped there, or were perhaps reviewing the wrong location. I've shopped at many other Copps locations before and have had no problems whatsoever. This Fitchburg location, however, is abysmal to say the least. Why, you ask? Where should I begin? 

The "Customer Service" counter? Empty. On the rare occasion there is someone there, I've been told to wait just one second, while they leave the area completely and never return. I have honestly been wanting to buy lottery tickets from this Copps for the last year, and 9 times out of 10 there is no one there to help you. 

The seafood area? Desolate. There is NEVER anyone at the seafood area to help you. There is also no bell to ring in the seafood area for service. The only bell is in the meat section. Which brings me to my next gripe: The meat section. There is NEVER anyone in the meat department. You wait (with about 3 or 4 other guests for 5 minutes before someone rings the bell for seafood from the meat department.

One more tidbit before I end this. Fairly important, indeed. Self checkout? No one is there. Other companies have one employee dedicated to the self checkout area, making it easy to get help when the computer has a problem. This branch, however, has random baggers running over to punch in codes then running away to bag again. It takes way too long to get help. I actually feel sorry for the employees, because this is clearly a management issue.

Overall, I can't even begin to estimate the amount of money this location loses per day by being understaffed and not attentive. If you want groceries, sure, they have groceries! If you're looking for any type of customer care, you will lose your mind shopping at the Fitchburg Copps.Typical Applebee's. My boyfriend had a gift card to go here otherwise we definitely would've tried somewhere else. The food is just okay. We started with the white queso dip which is decent. The chips were hot which was a big plus. I had the Three Cheese Chicken Penne and it was meh. Not enough sauce and the chicken was on the grill for way too long. So dry! My boyfriend had their 9 oz sirloin and he said it was okay as well. However they gave him about a cup of sour cream with his mashed potatoes which was weird. We also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix. Bleh.

Our server was super strange too...he was very busy talking to another table and it took a lot for us to get his attention. 

Place was kind of dirty. Our table was so sticky we were afraid to touch it.

Meh meh meh meh meh.I don't understand this place.

+ Quirky decoration, with the heavy tiger theme and all that fun stuff

+ Old, old school jukebox
- Old jukebox; not much selection from other genres

+ Tiny space
- One bartender; takes forever to get drinks
- No tap beers?
- Limited bottled beer selection
+ Free popcorn

- Cash only
- No ATM on-site (or anywhere nearby, that we could find)
- "Bouncer" checks you for carry-outs as you leave? Seriously? 

Meh. No thanks.Took a really long time to get the 'express' manicure (almost two hours).  We started my manicure half an hour late---I would have been more irritated if I had somewhere else to be.  The technician did an okay job, but for what it cost, I was not impressed.  Lasted just shy of two weeks.

The salon is badly in need of updating.  Everything screamed 80s, particularly the decor.  

On the upside, I got a free glass of wine and everyone was pleasant.I've been going to Laredos for about 13 years and have always been a fan. They have made some changes I don't love, but the chips and salsa and quick service usually make up for them. The meat is cooked authentic style(with potatoes) and generally very flavorful. There has been a time or two the meat has been too salty or burnt tasting but I would def. recommend Laredos to friends.


Edit - 9/30/12

Not too sure whats going on at the Whitney Laredo's but it's been kind of falling off..I would like to start out my review by saying Laredo's used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. However, my last two visits have left a lot to be desired. Like other reviewers have noted it seems that they have cut back on their food quality to save money. My family and I visited recently and ordered the following: 3 tacos, regular nachos, enchiladas meal, and two kids meals (quesadillas). The meat in all the dishes had chunks of potatoes (at first I thought they were large onions) which I thought was very odd. The kid's quesadillas were just a small tortilla with shredded cheese folded in half and pressed. Our bill came to $40.00 and I felt like at best we had about $8.00 worth of food out of a Sysco can and heated up. Service is good. Food not so good.Oh, St. Vinnie's. You let me down. Having been to many a thrift store as well as a bunch of antique shops/malls in the past week on my china plate mission, I literally laughed out loud while at this SVdP location. The prices were absurd! Now, I'm willing to pay a little more for something really nice. But when SVdP is asking more for china plates than the same style/design (in better condition) at an antique store, something is wrong. And this wasn't just one set or design. All the pricing amongst the dinnerware was bizarrely high. No purchase from me!Pros:
- Close to downtown and the belt line
- Comfortable beds

Cons: 
- Breakfast is lousy and the lounge is not clean. You have to remind the lounge attendant when the food runs out. They are most certainly not attentive. 
- While they now have a coffee machine, a lot of times they run out of cups and surprisingly NEVER have any coffee cup sleeves. 
- Some of the front desk staff is downright rude. Most of them are good but I found some to be rather abrupt and unwelcoming. 

To summarize, this is probably an ok hotel for the occasional traveler but if you are a business traveler and find yourself in a hotel 3 to 4 night every week then you will find this hotel severely lacking. 
Having stayed at various Starwood & Marriott hotels around the country, I am very disappointed in their service.I stay in hotels 3-5 nights a week. This hotel has some pros: bed was comfortable with nice clean warm comforters. This hotel appears old and in much need of upgrading. Old dark brown doors that look like they have been hanging sine the 60s.  It was below zero outside and the heat would be off every day when entering room.  Really???  A deep clean needs to be done in rooms.  I had to move chair slightly to find a shoe and it was pretty dusty. I ordered room service 3 days for breakfast. First day, it was good. Second day, not as good. Third day, it was awful. Omelet was brown inside from being overlooked.  Walls were very thin. I heard the guy next door on the phone at 5:30 AM. Not good!!!  The shuttle was wonderful.  It was below zero outside and it was nice to get shuttle to restaurants at night. Some front desk people were fabulous and some not so much.  It was interesting.Yes it's a buffet... That's not sayin much, in Madison there are some really great Chinese places an this ain't one of them. They do have lots of different dishes to try  nothing really stands out. Good for a quick lunch if you like cheap fried food, ready when you walk in the door. Only thing I wounder about is how long the sushi has been sitting?What was I thinking?! 

I worked on New Year's Eve, but since Madison bars stay open late that night, I was able to go party with the best of 'em after midnight. Er. Take that back. The crowd at Madhatters (or, Hatters, as my Australian friends call it) was decidedly greasy and undergrad, and it's the first time I've gone to a bar and felt OLD. When we first arrived at the door, we couldn't even get in. Hatters? Full? That is, until a few of the Badger Basketball players showed up, towering above us, pushing me over and plying the door guy with a $1 bill, asking if that would "get us all in".

Why two stars and not just one little guy? Well, everybody did pretty much just keep to themselves and their own on-coming hangovers. And someone bought us a few "cows" (Spotted Cow). And I was mildly entertained by the guys who kept running into the foosball table. Ouch! Happy New Year, Madison!I've experienced several spa services at Kneaded Relief and I just can't justify the cost compared with other spas around town.  The prices of their massages and waxes are higher than what I am used to for similiarly skilled talent in Madison.  

It's a lovely environment, but I can't help but feel like I'm paying a bit too much.Really, you could to better.
Unless you're 20 or younger, or from Jersey. Really, this bar is NOT THAT GREAT. I would have given it a "one star" if only to bring down its average, but it is a a "two star". 
It has a good, central, off-State location, has good specials, and is spacious. And decent bartenders. And that's all it's got going for it.
Clientelle is pretty lame, and the last time I was there, even though I was with a huge group of friends, it still couldn't mask the icky flavor of the place.
Try it if you'd like, but you could do much better, even on campus.Yelp stated it was closed Saturday night but it was open. This is a total college bar so if you're over 25 don't bother. Waiting in line just to make it look busy so that was lame. Then 3rd floor smelled like vomit, liquor, and cheap perfume. ..lol over all it was entertaining but I wouldn't go again unless I'm trying to pick up trashed white girls who think they can twerk.Summary: highly overrated and apparently very inconsistent as identified by other reviewers.  Extremely pricey, fills up quickly, no parking, but decent service.  If I was looking only for pizza, I'd look elsewhere.

Detailed review: we've been reading the Yelp reviews about this place for a few months and couldn't wait to try it out.  So, we decided to make the short trek down to Regent Street; with the snow, the roads were interesting but definitely passable.

Finding parking was our first challenge... there's no lot, and there isn't any space near the actual restaurant.  We eventually found parking in one of the hospital ramps across the way.

We entered the Greenbush, and were immediately charmed by the quaint and cozy setting.  It's definitely small - it'll maybe seat 60 people, and if you're taller than six-feet, you'll be ducking the entire time.  A hostess sat us near the bar at a small two-top table.

We browsed the drink list and menu for a bit; our server stopped by to take our drink orders - a Spotted Cow and a glass of Pinot Noir.  We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread with marinara ($6).

Within a few minutes, we decided to try a pizza.  The pastas sounded great, but this place is known for it's pizza, so we chose the 12" thin crust with pepperoni, capicola ham, roasted peppers, and basil.

The bread arrived; three average sized slices of fairly dry bread with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese and a cold dish of marinara.  Light on garlic flavor, but thankfully it wasn't drenched in butter or anything like that.

The place was quickly filling up, and our waiter became a little more scarce, but for good reason - when the place fills up, you can't see more than 3-4 feet around you and trying to navigate the crowds is challenging to say the least.

Our pizza arrived and it was burned to a crisp - the top was so burned that we couldn't see any peppers or basil.  The waiter said something about the "crust wouldn't firm up" and offered to cook us a new pizza if we didn't like this one.  

We took one bite and figured we could burn toast at home if we wanted that charred taste, so we ordered a new pizza.  The second pizza arrived within 10 minutes or so, and it was cooked much better on top, but the crust was soft and flimsy.  

The toppings were sparce; the pepperoni greasy, and we couldn't detect much basil flavor at all.  The chewy/doughy crust seemed a bit undercooked, but given the alternative, we gnawed away on it "as was."

The bill arrived - $46.  ZOIKES.  Really?  $46 for 2 drinks, an appetizer, and a 12" thin crust pizza that tasted like a mediocre frozen pizza?  Me thinks not.

Greenbush = FAIL

Service = 3.5 stars (decent; got worse as place filled up)
Food = 1.5 stars (highly - HIGHLY - overrated)
Value = 0 stars
Misc = 4 stars (liked the atmosphere and cozy nature)

As we were leaving, we came to the conclusion that the Greenbush seems to attract an older, more yuppie-ish crowd that probably enjoys the cozy setting, nice wine list, and bland food.  Next time I feel like pizza, I'll look elsewhere.What a complete disappointment.

We live nearby, and yesterday had some big and exciting news to celebrate. It was late and nice outside so we decided to talk a walk to Paisan's and try it for the first time.

What do you do when you need to celebrate? You order champagne. We ordered 25 dollar champagne. We got ... a BOTTLE OF COOK'S. Really?? REALLY? If you are going to serve us cheap champagne, fine, but at LEAST be smart enough to get something no one will recognize! What's more, while the waiter was nice and all, he wasted tons of our champagne. He didn't pour it right so it fizzed all kinds and he kept spilling it. THANKS. That was our 25 dollar bottle of effin' Cook's you just wasted.

We tried to move on, and order an appetizer. It's pretty much bread and cheese, or bread and cheese. Or bread and garlic. Cool. It was fine, but nothing special.

The pizzas were also fine, but nothing special. I got vegetarian pesto, Derek got the spicy one. I think these people are relying WAYYYY too much on their name, their legacy, and crappy Kraft cheese.  Way too much cheese. Really good cheese can be used in just the right amount for perfect flavor -- if you add a ton of bland, poor quality cheese to something, that's not going to make it suddenly taste better!!!

Desserts? Meh. Derek was horrified to find the tiramisu cut like a pie slice and not a square. (he's picky)

It was a pretty building. The acoustics in the back room, the one overlooking the "lake" (read: freeway) are terrible though. Also, it's dirty. The floors were covered.

I'm thinking ... never again. Not worth my close-to-90 dollars. And it ruined our celebration. I really wish we had gone somewhere else.You have to completely and utterly tanked to enjoy Toppers. Period. There is no other reason any reasonable person would ever want to put this shit into their body. This is the result of Ronald McDonald and the Noid conceiving a demon baby in a pit of flaming grease.  I have personally witnessed the reinforced cardboard pizza box fall apart under the pressure of that seeping acid they call oil. You will have burning diarrhea for days. There is good cheese everywhere in Wisconsin; the pudding-like goop they put on top of their pizza is not an excuse to do this to yourself.

Combine this with the fact that they have the most arrogant, inattentive customer service in the history of restaurants, and it makes for the shittiest dining experience possible. It takes no less than an hour to get a pizza from here, but it leans more towards 2-3 hours when it's late and the drunk idiots with no taste barrage the place with orders. I am pretty sure that eating at Toppers is forbidden in the Old Testament. For the sake of yourself, everyone in smelling distance of you, and the children with birth defects you may father/mother if you continue to eat here, just put down the phone.

Upped to 2 stars because I enjoyed it in a drunken, shameful moment of weakness. May or may not have cried afterwards.Excellent Bar-B-Que food.  Just recently had the Salmon.  Waiter was great and he said he's been there something like 8 years!  What does that say for the place?  They must take good care of their staff and also provide them with a place they love to work at.  We love to eat there. Prices are a little above inexpensive.  Atmosphere is nice.  A little crowded.  Bathrooms are pretty clean but not perfect.  We really like this place.  Wish it was larger.

Update:  Went here and ordered a burger.  Something has changed because the meat itself was lousy.   Nothing much different than  a fast food burger and actually a little worse.  What's up Famous Daves????

Update:  Just tried their BBQ chicken sandwich.  The flavor was just just ok.   Not bad but not Dave's Delicious.   The meat seemed a bit skimpy too.  Never noticed before but their buns are all white wonder bread.  Sorry Dave but that doesn't cut it with me.   Can't you do a better bun than that?   The service continues to be quite good here but I have to now say, stay away from their sandwiches.  They are sort of fast food quality.  Not what I expect from a good BBQ restaurant.

Update:  Went back again.   The Salmon was ok to good but the shrimp was awful.  It was like eating dry wads of newspaper.   Way, way overcooked.  No juiciness left in them.  It was carry out so we ate what we could and tossed the rest.  If I had been eating in they would have been sent back.   Truly the worst shrimp I have ever been served.
This is it for me.   Won't be going back here for some time.  They need a new chef.  Big mess.Went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed. 

The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...

My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like "Oh, he didn't get his food?!" and that was a bit perplexing.

And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.

All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead.I only go here when I'm a few drinks in because their drinks are expensive! They have sake bombs and jello shots for those of us who want to not drop $5 on a little tiny drink.

You also have to pay for each song. I mean, shouldn't you be paying me to sing? I've had some rude service here from a particular bartender when choosing songs. It was too close to the end of the night to get a song in...unless I paid her $20. Really? No thank you! We left after that.

They also don't let you sing "Don't Stop Believin' ," even though it's in their book, because it's "broken." Heh, right. I think they just got sick of hearing it a million times a night.Stayed at Holiday Inn in Madison West as we visited friends for the weekend. Upon arrival to the hotel, wanted to grab a bite to eat so decided to try out George's Chop house. I ordered a Porter house and my wife ordered the shrimp and scallop with red sauce. The steak was just ok. I thought it was under seasoned. Nothing to be wowed about. The shrimp and scallop was actually pretty good. Over all experience was ok. But would probably not go back there again.I hadn't read too many great reviews about this place on Yelp! but a friend suggested I try this place before I left Wisconsin so I decided to give them a try.  Despite hearing fairly good reviews about the pizza I planned to get Ians the next day (my last Saturday in Madison) so I decided to go with a cheeseburger instead.  We arrived and were waited on in a timely fashion.  I placed my order for a Chicago burger with American cheese (see pic) and my friend ordered the appetizer sampler (see pic) thinking it would be a regular sized sampler.  

My burger arrived in about 20 minutes.  It was cooked he way I asked, medium-rare.  The burger itself was pretty decent, but nothing memorable.  It was fairly dry but not really ridiculously so.  Instead of fries I got a side salad which was ok, although you'd think tomatoes were in short supply in the world since I only got one 1 tiny cherry tomato in my salad.  I also didn't like the lack of cheese in my salad but lots of places don't offer that so no big deal.  

My friends appetizer turned out to be HUGE, about what 4 or 5 people would snack on while waiting for their dinner.  I tried a couple of hot wings, a bbq wing and cheese stick of of the tray.  The wings were meaty but not particularly hot (as in hot/cold hot) and the hot wings weren't particularly spicy either, rather bland.  The bbq wings had a decent amount of sauce but the hot wings were definitely not sauced enough.  The cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste.  All in all the sampler tasted about like the burger, pretty decent but pretty forgettable.  

So I guess my bottom line is this place is alright, I'd go hear again if a friend suggested it but I'd never come back here on my own initiative.  They do have a really nice patio out back and their beer list looked really strong so that'd probably be the main thing for me to ever want to try if I were to come back.  Oh that and the pizza of course.  And just a note, the service was fine and the restaurant seemed pretty nice, as well as clean, it's just the food was not particularly great, just average.  This place reminds me alot of TGIF's, of which I'm not a fan of...

Although I didn't taste the pizza it looked pretty decent from the people sitting around me and it's possible, although unlikely from the reviews on Yelp!, that the pizza may be the item to order here.  It's highly unlikely I however will ever find out..A couple of my friends really enjoy this place, but no matter how much I try, I just can't warm-up to the place.

They do have a decent tap selection, which includes a nice mix of local micros and tasty macros.  Not in the mood for a tap?  Check out the large selection of bottled brews.  Their beer menu is excellent because it lists the style, the origin (city/state/country), and ABV.  Pricing is a bit higher than you'll find at most of the locally-run pubs.

The food and service is where I have to take away a star or two... The food I've tried has been greasy - from the chicken tenders to the pizza rolls to the regular pizza - it's all been terribly greasy.  It tastes hyper-processed - I think another reviewer made note of this, and I couldn't agree more... And, it's overpriced - count on spending around $22-$24 for dinner, a drink, and a soda/tea.  

Service is (wait for it) spotty.  I've been to this location five or six times, and have only once had a really good server - we sat in the bar, and our server was excellent.  He never let a glass go beyond 2/3 empty.  Sitting in the dining area has resulted in less than favorable service, even when the place wasn't busy.

So... Old Chicago... I'm sorry, but I have to give you a "MEH" rating.

Food = 2 stars (greasy; seems sub-par)
Service = 2 stars (very spotty; sit in the bar for best service)
Value = 2 stars (pricey)
MISC = 3 stars (good beer selection)

With places like Roman Candle, Rosatti's, Glass Nickel, Buck's, and others very nearby, I can't justify hitting Old Chicago.  Sorry.Minimal bagel selection on a Sunday morning was disappointing.Not the greatest place ever. has a pretty massive indoor pool which is great. The beds aren't special, the TVs are old, and the breakfast is horrible. It's not expensive so whatever, that's what you get.I used to like to go to O'Grady's.  They used to make a pretty good burger.  But over the last 3 years or so they've really slipped.  I used to take my pops into here and we used to get burgers and have a few beers, but I wouldn't take him here anymore.  I've tried to eat here about 4 times in the last 3 years (I keep going back because I really used to like it.)  The last two times I got a burger they were overcooked and not well seasoned.  The service was also poor and slow. I also used to like the Mozzarella sticks with pretzels on the breading, but the last few times I ordered them they were overcooked as well.  

 I went in once and 3/4 of the beer taps were not working.  

At least they still have a decent bottled beer selections and some Irish beers on tap.  I'll go in for a beer late night or before a movie or something, but I don't think I'll be able to eat here again, which is sad.  I hope they turn it around.We weren't really impressed. The service was fine, but the pizza wasn't very good. We got the Margharita and the basil was all wilty and dry. We probably won't go back even though we live within walking distance as there are better pizza places in town.I just don't get it.  I read all these reviews and I was expecting some delicious dinner.  Instead what I got was what could be found in any kitchen in the county.  Under-seasoned and over-cooked meat and potatoes.  Obviously Quivey's Grove really DOES cater to the midwestern palate.Went here for our anniversary, which lands on St. Patty's Day, so to avoid the mayhem of Guinness chugging, we ate in the Stone House rather than the Stable Grill. 

Sadly, the best part of my meal was the warm muffins that they serve in lieu of rolls(that day it was Irish Oatmeal and Raisin). They were so moist and yummy...but then it just went down from there. I chose one of the three meals they offer for around $17 that comes with a cup of soup and a glass of wine--which I have to admit is a nice price. The soupwas good, but the salad I had him order so we could trade was SWIMMING in low-quality blue cheese dressing. My chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well. The biscuit was overdone, and the rest was an over salted gelatinous...thing. He liked his pretzel crusted fish(perch, I think), but we both agreed that the Parmesan potato(a wad of cheesy hash browns) was undercooked, and cool in the middle. Hm. We were both glad we didn't get any of the pricier entrees, in case the quality was on the same level. 

After our meal, we did go through the wine cave and tunnel to the Stable Grill and thought it would be a good place for drinks and apps. 

All in all, not a place I'm going to be dropping my money at, though.Had dinner last night at Quivey's Grove, and the food wasn't great. I had the Reuben, which had soggy rye bread, dry edges on the brisket slices and a spoonful of sauerkraut and cheese. My bf had the Stable Burger, which had almost stale tough to bite through buns and a patty in BBQ sauce and mayo? The only thing I enjoyed, probably because I was uber hungry at the time, was the Cheese Beer Sausage Soup.Eh! Taste fresh for take out, I guess. I ordered the Spicy Basil with Beef. The sauce was spicy, and the vegetables were fresh, well-prepared, and plentiful. A little too plentiful. I only had a small portion of beef in my meal so I won't be returning. :-(Monkeyshines is the way to end a night of bad decisions.Not what it used to be.  Looks like this place has met with tough times.  The gift shelves are poorly stocked where they once had a number of creative gift ideas, stocking stuffers, mugs and the like.   Now just a few scraps left there from last year.   Sure, the wine and cheese is good but the service has been moderate to poor my last few stops. 
I recently waited for quite some time along with some other people.  No one acknowledged any of us to at least say, "be right with you".  I finally just left without buying anything.   
Sadly, I have to lower my rating for this place by three stars.One of the worse Indian food I have ever tried. I ordered Lamb Josh and the lamb was not well cooked and lamb biryani was also a big failure. Who the hell puts water chestnut in lamb biryani. The taste was also terrible. Will never go back :(Poorly managed. Had the potential to be a great club, considering the size and abundance of equipment. Unfortunately the management only seems to care about signing people up to long term, iron clad contracts.

The men's locker room is pretty disgusting most of the time, smelling of mold or B.O. or both. Who puts carpeting in a locker room that has consistent foot traffic from the showers?? Hot tub and steam room are pretty gross most of the time and the showers are in constant need of repair with soap dispensers that are only full about 1/2 the time.

Don't buy into their story about being able to transfer to a similar club anywhere in the country if you happen to move within your term. I'm stuck with the only option of driving to their 3rd location in New Berlin which is close to an hour drive. Only other option they offer is to put my contract on hold until I move back, which isn't in the cards. Money down the drain. Wouldn't renew even if I was nearby.Tough to arrange a day-pass. Nice amenities but smaller on the inside than appears on the outside. Would not recommend to passers-through due to prohibitive day-pass cost.I visited Vera's with three of my bridesmaids, hoping to find the perfect dress. I had been dress shopping three times before and knew exactly what I wanted -- fabric, silhouette, etc. -- and I was ready to buy a dress. I had 10 Ben Franklins waiting in my purse (gotta hide the cost from the Mr.) I DID find the perfect dress at Vera's, but not because of my consultant or the service.

The appointment started out very dry and sanitary; I was half expecting the consultant to take a blood sample and check my blood pressure. No questions about how I wanted to feel in my dress, what I liked or didn't like, or about the general feel of the wedding. Instead, she asked a laundry list of impersonal questions. 

When I brought up that I had been dress shopping before and wanted a sweetheart neckline, mermaid or fit-and-flare silhouette, and rouching across the stomach, she dismissed my preferences and told me that my desire for a mermaid silhouette was "impractical" because many brides "think they can pull it off, but really can't" -- as if my 5'3", 125 lb figure wouldn't be able to handle such a vampy cut.

She brought me two dresses to begin with. One was taffeta and pink, with assorted Swarovski crystals tacked on in a way that appeared as if someone mixed the beads with super glue and put them in the dryer with the dress. The cut wasn't flattering at all, and it was far from what I indicated that I liked. Moreover, I had already said that I didn't like taffeta because it looks like a windbreaker, and I wasn't planning on having my bridesmaids wear matching tracksuits or giant clocks around their necks. 

I wasn't happy after trying on the first dresses and she made no other suggestions. I had to ask her to bring me more dresses.  She finally brought me a dress that was $2000, twice the price point that I told her I wanted to stay under. Then, she preceded to pressure me into buying the dress because she said I would regret my decision if I didn't.

She also made some offhanded comment about how the factory workers who assemble and bead the veils they have make close to 48 cents an hour, which, according to her, isn't bad and it's enough to support a family! Who knew.

My bridesmaids were all in a huff by this point, and I was also fairly annoyed. I called out a "Bridesmaids! Mush!"  and they took to the racks themselves. My sister pulled the perfect dress -- slight sweetheart, satin, mermaid, rouching, no beading -- and I knew it was the dress I would be married in the second I put it on. The the consultant's credit, she did suggest that I go to a room with natural light, as the wedding is outside, and then she was very meticulous in the ordering process. 

The consultant didn't bother to say goodbye or even give me her business card. My dress is gorgeous, and yes, short girls CAN pull of mermaid styles, and I look damn fantastic. 

I would not recommend Vera's to any bride or bridal party. I am hoping the service improves once my dress comes it. I don't know if I trust them to do my alterations.Ultimately, I ended up with what I wanted, but it was an ORDEAL.  And, had I not been paying attention, it could have been a disaster!  

Picking out the wedding dress was an overall good experience.  However, when I went there with my bridesmaids to find bridesmaids' dresses, our consultant was extremely rude to us the entire time.  They were also very condescending and mean to my bridesmaid who needed a plus size gown.  

I also moved during my engagement.  I gave them the new address, but I still had problems with them sending bills and fabric samples to my old address. Because of their clerical error, they tried to charge me late fees.  

Beware of a few things:  

1.  Tell them your price point immediately.  They will bring out the most expensive dresses if you don't.

2.  If your measurements don't seem right, ask them to remeasure.  My first measurements indicated that I was about 3 inches larger in the bust than I am (??).  If I had not known my measurements and questioned them, I would have ended up with hundreds more in alterations. 

3.  Ask what your measurements are compared to the sizes of your brand of dress.  I was lucky--the sample size was an 8 (and far too big), and she recommended that I buy an 8.  When I asked what my measurements were they lined up perfectly to a size 6... no bodice alternations needed!  They are ALWAYS trying to make a buck on alterations!  

4.  Double check your prices at checkout!!  I had a 10% off code, and they accidentally added 10% to my bill.  They corrected and apologized after I pointed out the error, but still... beware!!! 

5.  Remember that you will likely need your dress shortened.  I'm 5'10" and still needed it shortened.  That plus installing a french bustle equaled $290 in alterations.I work very nearby this particular Steep & Brew, and it is consistently hit-or-miss, as contradictory as that sounds. However, my most urgent complaint is that the majority of the baristas have no urgency whatsoever. I often try to build an extra 10 minutes into my morning commute to grab a cup of coffee and a pastry, and I'm forced to wait for a full 7 minutes while the one barista available slowlyyyyy makes pour-over coffee and precisely steamed lattes. 

I know it's a small shop, but the priorities and sense of urgency here are non-existent. Why don't they have carafes of coffee to the side, so those who are there to just get a cup can fill up, pay at the counter and get out? 

I wouldn't be complaining about this if it weren't a frequent and extremely irritating occurrence. Whenever I go there, I'm there at least 10 minutes before I need to be at work less than a block away and end up at work late, ALWAYS, due to a cup of coffee taking at least 7 minutes to obtain. 

Ridiculous. 

That said, the cherry danishes ARE delicious.As much as I wanted to give this place more I was really disapointed. It wasnt the staff, they were great but the food was mediocre and the place is just falling apart! The seats are ducttaped together and the carpet is disqusting! The place would do so much better with a little remodeling! 
The fish I had was very fishy and the sides were over salted. I dont think it was the chefs fault as much as the prep cook who got it ready. I was really disappointed in the food qualty and have had  better meals at take out establishments. For the price I would pass until I see progress.Hired Merry Maids Madison to do a total move-in/move-out cleaning of our one bedroom, 800sq. ft. apartment after we had moved out. Also had them clean one room of carpet (master bedroom, rest of the apartment was hardwood). Charged almost $400. When quoted, my attitude was "You get what you pay for."  

Returned after cleaning to do walk-though with management. Place was not clean. They hadn't even opened the door of the coat closet next to the front door to clean the floor inside of it! 

Walls were not cleaned at all, floors were not very well cleaned. 

On the plus side  carpet was fairly clean as were the appliances.

Definitely would not recommend. I'd have to say total rip-off at the prices they charge. Probably would have been better to hire the person from Criagslist who would have done it all for $150.00Not a fan. As far as pizza goes there are a bunch of options in Verona, especially south side, and the pizza hut is mediocre and overpriced. It's not horrible, but I only order from here when I'm too drunk to care about quality.

Everything you eat from here leaves a greasy film in your mouth. Like I said, when I do order from here it's because I don't care about the quality, I just want to eat.Call me a princess, but i liked to be pampered during my haircuts (why yes, that includes the $20 trims). 

That said, I wasn't completely satisfied by my experience at Cost Cutters. My haircut lasted a total of 10 minutes. The stylist didn't wet my hair before she cut it. HUH? She didn't try to style it after she finished cutting it. DERP. I walked out of the salon looking more disheveled than I did when I had walked in. WHAT IN THE WORLD. All I wanted was a blowdry&styling so I could see what the hairstyle actually looked like before I walked out the door. Sadface.

I'm debating whether or not I am willing to give another Cost Cutters stylist a try...or maybe I'll just wait until I go home for Christmas break to get a real haircut...Maybe Jet Blue has spoiled me.  I fly Jet Blue to Oakland a couple times a year and my flight has never left late.  Last time I flew to Vegas it was Jet Blue and once again on time.

So last week I go to Vegas for a convention and have to go with my co-workers and they all wanted to fly out of John Wayne/Orange County and not my beloved Long Beach Airport.  So we had to deal with US Airways.  At our flight departure time of 11:15 am our plane wasn't even at the gate yet.  By the time we boarded and got in the air it was already past our arrival time.  I had exactly 3 minutes and 45 seconds to drink my soda before being told they had to pick it up because the plane was preparing to land.  Our arrival was 1 hour and 15 minutes late with no offers of apologies and no explanations.

One star for not crashing and one for a cheap ticket.  But next time I'll be flying Jet Blue.the great thing about us airways is there is always something to talk about. the talk coming from my mouth is rarely good. i've flown with "us" waaay too often. i can count more times that my flight was delayed and/or canceled, my luggage has been lost (not delayed or mis-routed; straight up LOST) than times where the experience went even marginally smooth. the myriad of unacceptable situations i have encountered with "us" might boggle your mind. 

but, i keep coming back. 

maybe it is the free soda or the fact that i was recently sent a survey asking about what brands i might prefer with regard to the warm $7 beer on board? maybe it is because i get to pay them to check the bag they loose? maybe because the aircraft interiors are so awesomely outdated, inconvenient and uncomfortable? there are so many more options too!

to be very honest, i think "us" deserves 0 stars, but in generous recognition of the fact that i keep coming back i'll begrudgingly award 2 stars. after all, they haven't killed me and i've never been injured on a flight ... wait, actually i did suffer a minor injury once. but still, no death, near death or dismemberment experiences does rank pretty high when it comes to my air travel expectations. 

so there you have it: 2 stars.I am not impressed at all.  But I have no choice cuz I have to fly to Phoenix.  If I had another choice, I would not fly with US Air.  

I had to pay to check in my lugguage.  Service is bad.  Nothing is good.  Don't know how they remain in business.Sitting on the runway way waiting for a gate to open. The gate should have been ready. We were on time for arrival.  Instead....I now have JUST ten minutes to make my next plane (originally had 50 minutes). 

I was lucky and my gate was just a couple over and they hadn't closed the door yet. 

There were others on my plane that were not going to be so lucky. They had to go to different terminals and they would be running. 

Thanks again US Air for making the trip more stressful.On the way to cabo I decided to surprise my friend with an first class upgrade for her birthday. $150 each for the upgrade for a 2 hour flight was a disappointment.  To be honest virgin America main cabin is nicer.  Our flight attendant was too busy eating to realize everyone from coach was using the first class cabin bathroom. Another disappointment was the snacks... Or lack there of... Wow a bag of pretzels! Felt like Southwest Airlines to me. No movies and our feet didn't even recline.  Again virgin America regular seats so much better than first class us airways.  Price not worth it.You get what you pay for..... this should be 1 star but they get another one for having some decent prices when you need a flight last minute.  Having flown with them 3-4 times over the years I just can't picture myself flying with them again unless they make some major changes. From customer service, the morale of your attendants, baggage fees, and multiple delays, why choose US Airways when you have better alternatives? Pay a little more and avoid the headachePretty fun breakfast with my fav's. Alas I could only give it 2 stars because it didn't knock my socks off. Our server seemed nice enough, but definatly not going for any server of the month awards. If it's your cheat day, def try the cinnamon roll. You WILL LOVE IT..You're waistline, not so much (but that's why we have cheat days :D

Overall it was good, nothing special, kind of your standard breakfast joint.

Will I be back? Sure, if I there isn't a new and fun place to discover :)So there were some very good things about this hotel, but all of the negatives outweigh the good and ultimately make this a hotel I wouldn't stay at again.
First, a disclaimer- I am a Hilton Diamond VIP.  I spend a huge portion of my life in hotels, and Hilton is my chain.  So I get hooked up.  And so it's weird when I go to another chain and don't get any perks or a choice room.  However, I be that most people who are going to stay here AREN'T high on their loyalty program, so their experience may be a lot like mine.
I stayed here for a business convention for 3 nights.  I was put on the 6th floor in the "atrium."  Yes, atrium is hotel for "noisy."  Because it was.  Very, very loud.  The whole floor is open to the meeting area below, and night time events are hosted here until well after 10 p.m.  One night I woke up at about 2 a.m. because drunk women were shouting and having too much fun.  Too loud to fall asleep/stay asleep?  Deal breaker.
Problem #2- my shower drain was completely clogged and the tub filled up and random hair was floating in it.  Gross.  So here's the thing.  If housekeeping cleans the shower at all, they have to run water.  If they run water, they have GOT to see that the tub isn't draining.  So they should call maintenance to fix it.  So this means that either the housekeeping staff didn't bother to clean the shower OR they didn't bother to have the drain fixed, either of which is lazy and totally unacceptable.  I had to shower in the gross water-filled tub on day #1.  To their credit, it was fixed after I called, but the point is that I should never have had to call.
The wifi was extremely slow, to the point where I started turning the wifi off and connecting with the 3G. (It really was that bad.)
The bed was decently comfortable, but the sheets were worn to the point of having small holes and should have probably been replaced 30 washes prior.
The attention to detail just wasn't there.
Last, the check in process is just bizarre.  They have self-serve kiosks, but someone from the front desk checks you in using the self-serve kiosk.  Why have them?  Checking into a hotel is actually one of the only times I prefer checking in with a human, so just eliminate the kiosks.  
The staff was exceptionally friendly, which was great, and the wait for the elevators was never too bad.  Valet is expensive, but they're generally pretty quick about bringing your car around.
The hotel is kind of in the middle of nowhere right downtown...however, there are a few places nearby to grab a quick lunch, and there's a Starbucks right across the street.  (Score!)
So although there were some great things about the Hyatt,  over all this is a hotel I wouldn't come back to.Very nice staff at this hotel. That's the nicest thing I can say. This is the shabbiest Hyatt ever. You're paying Hyatt prices, but you're really getting a crappy motel inside the walls.

Kids, there are no towel bars or racks in the bathroom. ANYWHERE. You can't hang a towel up even if you want to. There are no safes in the room. No mini-fridges in the room. No information on the business center or amenities or hours in the room. 

The carpet in my room was stained all around the bed (I don't want to know, really). The tub was equally stained (yuck) and standing under the shower was like being peed on thanks to abysmal shower heads and very low water pressure. 

Bet this manager is glad he's across the street from the Convention Center, or he'd lose his flag and his AAA diamonds. Ick, is all I can say. Where's that Hotel Impossible guy when you need him?Coworker and I went for lunch.  Absolutely packed and the food was just ok.  My hotdog was like something you would get at him.  Regular bun and dry with a cheap weiner in it.    My buddy got the gyro.  Again nothing to write home about.  I got a great dog off the cart off the street that was cheaper that this place.Just ordered here for lunch with some coworkers. Meh. I thought the price was kind of crazy for what I got. I ordered a Chicken Picado Pita (or something of that nature), and it was just ordinary. Literally something I could have whipped up on my grill at home. Caramelized onions, tomatoes, peppers, and chicken. It was really lacking in tomatoes and the pieces of chicken were very few for the price. Food tasted a bit greasy too and there wasn't really any seasoning to differentiate this food from something, like I said, that I could have just made at home. The price was $7.45 I think. But with tax and delivery, it was probably more like $8.50. I could go to a more authentic med place and pay less than that for a pita, and it would be packed with stuff. Which I'll probably just do next time! :)

Won't order here again.Ordered the mushroom burger, they put canned mushrooms on the burger. Gross! The patty melt was good. But it's really hard to mess up a patty melt. My salad had a bug in it.

Service was nice. And they do have a yummy cider beer.Slow and unfriendly service.  Food is so so. Took 20 minutes just to get drinks.2/5 standard chinese.

i'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish.I remember when I used to sit with proprietor David L. at Biltmore C.P. (not CPK, you freak) and listen to him get passionate about this modular bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively. Willo Bread was born.

I also remember when I was little going to My Florist for FLOWERS. Over the years, the strip mall saw many tenants come and go and seemingly at just the right moment, David picked up one of the suites and began his bakery project. After its extreme success with local AJ's and "fine" restaurants around town, he expanded to the old flower shop (converting it to a restaurant), its loft overhead and the adjoining suite for the grocery.

Perhaps it was my third visit that was the one I shan't forget. I am a pianist and have played professionally here and there over the years. After hearing just one selection by SAVANT [Nicole?] I was so discouraged I resolved never to play again. I hate her (not really) for being so good. Try going up to talk to her and you'll see what I mean. She's clearly multi-tasking on 7 or 8 different threads, one of which is to talk with you. I've seen her on the phone while playing with one hand, reaching out to the nearby table while playing with one hand, totally looking the opposite direction for minutes at a time, and more. Total Savant.

She easily has the entire repertory of all music in her head, but for her it is not the music itself, but the concepts of the music from which she plays. She can play the entire soundtrack from Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. It's uncanny. Ask her to play a classical piece, and only because you know the exact note order, phrases and timings do you realize that she's pretty close, but not exact. Who cares? She could play against Mozart in dueling pianos and he'd end up on the floor gasping in and out of a paper bag.

At some point David bought her a concert Steinway, well deserved.

Other than the place where [name?] played during her lifetime, My Florist will have no other mark on the history of Phoenix. To those of us still alive wishing we could add our own marks on history, our screaming and YELLING about the poor service, useless bartenders and ridiculous menu will be but whispers against her virtuosity. But let me make my attempt.

Seeing my favorite bottle of gin on the shelf, I ordered my martini: "Sapphire martini, straight up, stirred (!!!) with a twist". What came back was a brown thing that looked like chocolate milk. "Oh, I thought you ordered an espresso martini." Tell me, does Sapphire sound like "espresso" to you? My answer is... only to someone who has NO CLUE about what a real martini is. Do me a favor and don't insult the reputation of Bombay Sapphire: please instead display and serve Gordon's.

After a recent performance of the Arizona Broadway Theater, we joined the cast as they gathered for a late dinner and drinks. After the 25 of us ate and drank, we spent the next 55 minutes (no joke) figuring out the bill because they couldn't split the check, not even in half. forGET it! (don't you forget CASH -- in small denominations -- if you're going with a group).

If from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen, mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu, it's because you can: the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate, the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish, and the same bread (yes, it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning), is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is.

Not to say that the bread isn't good. Just know that when bread is made this way (without all the nasty chemicals and preservatives), and then is exposed to AIR, it gets hard. Eat it within a few hours of being baked. My advice is to go to the grocery first thing when it opens and try to get one of the 4 willowich sandwiches available daily (scrumptious ham, cheese, basil and add vinaigrette) before they go. You'll have to beat me, so get up early.The place is beautifully sunlit and airy, filled with fine modern clean lines and just enough easy color and art to add visual interest, not too crowded, and not uncomfortably trendy. They were well suited for my large group of friends and I, so we were excited when we decided to have dinner there. 

The menu selection was decent--standard cafe fair, with sandwiches, wraps, and salads. They had a nice wine selection, although I thought their per-glass charge seemed a little pricey. Service was fine and quick enough, so I have nothing bad to say there. The highlight: The Tuna Almondine I ordered was delicious! It was not overdressed or strangely sweet like a lot of tuna fish sandwiches out there, and the almonds added a nice toasted nutty flavor without it or their hard, slightly crunchy texture getting in the tuna's way. But it's hard to mess up tuna, and I was easily able to recreate the dish at home for a lot less than 11 bucks. Okay, I can understand--it's café food. There's ambiance to pay for, and it is nice there. And someone back in the kitchen works hard to make that sandwich. Fine. But the deal breaker was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich. 

Just about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches. My salad was limp, fainted dead away. And it smelled like freshly mown grass, which is totally fine if we're discussing freshly mown grass, and not something I'm expected to shove into my maw. To be fair, my dining companions could only kind of smell what I could in their own salads, so it wasn't as big as an affront to them. Maybe I just got the bottom of the bag, since it did seem to just be a bagged mix. Plus, my taste buds and especially my sense of smell are sensitive--not saying they're great or even good, but they seem pick things up that a lot of folks don't. Everyone thought their food ranged from "good" to "pretty good." Overall, it's a decent option if you're in the area and want a nice café experience. (Read: Don't want to hit the nearest sandwich shack or deli, like my preference, Miracle Mile Deli up on Central and Thomas, or want a sit-down as opposed to a grab-and-go, like Willo Baking Co. right next door--holy yum, with beautiful desserts, and last I checked, they supplied My Florist's bread, anyway). So try My Florist for yourself, but for the price, do not hesitate to bring a discerning palate or be embarrassed to send a dish back if it's not up to par.Ugh... this place is pretentious, it's not even funny.  I used to think sandwiches at Paradise Bakery were kinda pricey.  That was before I came to My Florist.

I  have only ever ordered the chicken salad sandwich the couple times I've been here because I am picky.  I could probably go for the PB & J, but I would have to be out of my mind to pay the price they are asking.  The chicken salad is decent, but I have had so much better.  The bread they use is artisan style bread, so of course that means ridiculously chewy crust.  This isn't a bad thing when you eat the bread by itself, but when you are trying to bite off a piece of your sandwich and the crust refuses to give, even a little bit, then you will be flinging chicken salad all over the place.  Not a good thing.

The service here is downright terrible.  I've never seen servers so smug in my life.  Sometimes I wonder if it is a joke that I'm not in on, and the other times I just wonder if they really do feel so superior as they are serving me my food.  Whatever, I don't really care.  Everything here is super slow.  My soda takes forever to come out because the bartender always thinks that his social life is more important than my soda at the time.  

In any event, I avoid this place.  The crowd is always too uppity for my taste and they are mostly old.  You should have seen the look of some of the people in there when I went in wearing pajama pants one night (I was ready for bed when the husband and his friend wanted to go out to eat.)  Hilarious.  On the positive side, the pianist here is fantastic.The last two times I've ate here it was NOT good. It took 45 minutes for my friend and I to get salads (and no, they were not busy). The most recent time the service was poor. Took awhile to get refills. Maybe our waiter was new... Either way I don't recommend this place. After talking with friends, they all had similar stories. I like Zoe's way better (it's across the street).Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.Eh -- no. 

I stopped here for quick take-out one day while at work. They had no sushi at all (even though it's on the menu), and the menu itself isn't laid out very well for understanding what they have/what's included.  I wasn't there to eat onsite, but good thing -- very little inside seating.  The food wasn't all that good, and if the customer says "to go", then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me. The place didn't seem very clean either. 

Just not a good experience. Go somewhere else.Can you give the production 4 1/2 stars and give the play 0? I thought the production was terrific, but I hated the play. And unfortunately, the experience requires both to be good.

When you walked in the stage set was spare, but well utilized and intriguing. 

Lighting and sound were spot on. Being in the back row, I could hear every cue given by what I assume was the stage manager in the booth behind the audience, but if the play had kept my attention, I might not have noticed.   

The performances were strong. I especially enjoyed the woman who was playing several male characters.

But the material was torturous. This was a mean and confusing interpretation of the story, which the author bragged about in the program. Transitions from character to character and actor to actor were muddy. And I must admit I was so not enjoying the play that I left at intermission, so perhaps it got better at the end. The couple sitting next to us said they didn't blame us when we said goodnight, the woman looked a little wistful. 

The production was terrific, but it could not rise above the play. I actually hope that this production is NOT seen by people who have not been to an Arizona Theatre Company performance before, I would hate to see them lose audience for their productions on the basis of poor material.Facebook for tv is what the morning show is.   Terrible grammar. Reporters who literally say "omg" when starting a sentence. It is like the producers of this show are Jr high students. Stories of how cells and tablets make kids lazy while morning show hosts desperately cling to their cell phone AND tablet throughout the show. Very juvenile and out of touch broadcasting with reporters/anchors who LOVE to talk about themselvesI worked out at this gym for a little under a year between April 2012 to March 2013. I had recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago-area and had been a member at my local Y in Illinois for 5+ years. 

I'm not sure if my Illinois-based YMCA is just super nice and I had become spoiled, or what the deal is, but I found this Y disappointing.

I went in for a tour and membership info when I first arrived in Phoenix. The membership fee was around $50/month, which I found outrageous for the shape this place is in. It's older (though apparently recently renovated?), small exercise rooms, and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs.

I knew after touring the place I couldn't justify the price. I later found out that the Ys in the Valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance, which is $25/month -- that is the ONLY reason I decided to join. I signed up for my insurance fitness program, and presented the information to the Y. That, in and of itself, was a nightmare. I won't go into that in this review, though, since I joined at the Christown YMCA, and it wouldn't be fair to blame the downtown location for their issues.

Back to my review of the downtown location. When I first started coming regularly, their water machine was broken. Two weeks later, it was still out of order, and I have no idea how long it was not functioning before I joined. 

I generally take group exercise classes at the gym, and this location offers a decent variety. Which brings me to my next issue -- the instructors. The ones I've had are generally OK, though I don't think the kickboxing class is nearly the great workout that everyone seems to think.

However, I will say that on one memorable occasion when I arrived to take a Spin class, I asked the instructor (politely) if we could please turn on the fans in the cycle room since it is tiny, has no air flow, and gets HOT as Hades. He replied, "I don't use fans in my class." Wow. I have never experienced such rudeness/arrogance from a class instructor anywhere previously or since.

I really love supporting YMCAs and helping the community, but I don't think I could justify the cost of this one in exchange for the facilities & service.The Paper Heart is certainly not the worst place in Phoenix, but I've never been able to get a good vibe here.  Great criticism, right?  Let me expand: 

By all accounts the Paper Heart SHOULD be really cool - live music, cheap drinks, a cool crowd and some arty crap on the walls, but it has always come across as iffy at best to me.  It's a large concrete space, so it seems too big to be comfortable, with chairs scraping loudly across the floor.  It has a weird couch setup near the stage that somehow becomes a central focus of the room.  It's got a couple of tables with chairs, but they're scattered around the room in strange places.  

It's echo-y and loud and I'd have to strain to hear conversation across the table.  The performances have always been way less than spectacular and though the beer is cheap, it's just lacking some soul.A visiting friend and I gave breakfast here a try before heading to Sedona back in April '08.  The salsa was very good.  My friend said that the chips were awesome.  I had a breakfast burrito (eggs and ground beef) that wasn't very memorable, while she had something similar with chorizo wrapped in a soft corn tortilla and smothered with a sweet red sauce.  She didn't like it very much.
 
I liked the wooden furniture that reminded me of the furniture found in every home back in the Philippines- dark, heavy, and many are engraved.  I thought the Native American theme was a little-off, but she found it charming.  

Service was very slow- we sat waiting for more than ten minutes before someone came out of the kitchen to greet us.  Lunch menu items are rather inexpensive, so I may visit again sometime in the next few years...OK... While I do agree with some previous posters that Calabria is WAY better than any fast food options (and yes, Subway is fast food, people), I find a lot to be lacking at Calabria.

Located in the awesome Historic Gold Spot, I really wanted Calabria to have the charm of an Italian deli one would find in Northern New Jersey.  But, alas... It has all the charm of yet another strip mall store you find everywhere in Phoenix. 

Yes, they do have what seem to be fresh meats and cheeses, but the sandwiches are in my opinion lackluster. I once tried one of their arancini and found it to be very similar to hush puppies like I grew up with. Fried within an inch of its life and not very tasty. 

Having said that, their lasagna is tolerable. 

To me, the problem with Calabria is the value for what you're paying. It's like a $10 lunch that's more of a $5 value. 

Plus, I hate the way they've taped over their menu sign with little strips of white paper the items they no longer carry. 

Tacky.I drove two hours to try what other reviewers called "the best chicken in the US." Really?? Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had, and the customer service was ridiculous. Stank attitude all around from our waitress (for no dang reason).

Ruined my meal to tell you the truth, so I asked for their infamous red velvet cake to go. She put it in a paper bag and nearly slammed it on the table before walking off. I can't even tell you if I liked the cake. I was so mad by then, I just wanted to leave. 

Not really what I call one of my better experiences.Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. 

First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. "Oh it is the best soul food", "They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere.." are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are "cool" or trendy. 

Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.TOO MUCH HYPE!

I came here for my supervisors going away party and wasn't satisfied. I guess we should've made reservations because this place was packed. We had about a group of 12 and the wait time was around 15 minutes. Not too bad, it gave everyone time to look through the menu. 

Lolos appeared to have a decent variety of foods, including desserts. The prices range from $7 and up.

I ordered the Lolos which came with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of southern style chicken. The waffles were surprisingly thin about an inch and the chicken,  surprisingly large. I was told the chicken was really small, but you can share the portions for the most part. The chicken wasn't flavorful,  in my opinion it lacked salt just a tad would've helped. The chicken tasted pretty low quality. The waffles were very flavorful though,  I could clearly taste the cinnamon they'd used. The thing about the waffles I didn't like was the soggy texture. The texture could be due to the thiness of the waffle. I didn't try any of their famous Kool Aid so...but they get a star for their service...everyone seemed alright and helpful. 

Overall,  I think I'd expected something grander than overpriced bland chicken, and limp waffles. I'd rather get my chicken and waffles from IHOP...blasphemy,  I know, but it actually taste better to me.Was excited to be going to the Comerica Theater, went and saw Kevin Hart on the 3rd,  the show was funny, enjoyed seeing Kevin, but the review is about the venue and not the act. And I really wanted to like Comerica Theater.
It was my 1st time at the Comerica Theater, and I have to say its kinda left me with a eh impression, guess it's going to have to be a big act to make me think about coming back. It was very warm in the place and yea I was up on the balcony level, and the staff just kept saying yea the heat rises and even stated if I was at the theater in July or August it would have been well past 100 degrees up there.  Really?? We are 2012, can't we figure out how to provide AC for the entire venue, I have been to events in the summer that's in enclosed tents that have more AC going on,,,and it's a TENT..I'm sure something can be done, I don't like being hot when watching a show because all I am thinking about is getting out of this hot joint.  Ok enough about that.
And like others have stated the seats are crazy small, and not just for width of a person, also for length, I am 6 ft tall, add some heels to that and yea I got legs for days, felt sorry for the person in front of me who had knees in his head all night all.  SMH not everyone is 5ft 9 or smaller. Started feeling uncomfortable.  Again thinking man when is this show going to be over so I can get up out of this joint, hot and & cramped!! And what a waste of thinking that way, I was there is see Kevin Hart!!! Enjoy some laughter and shouldn't have been thinking man this better end soon.  (But I did enjoy Kevin Hart and his show!)

Yea it will have to be a die for act for me to come back to Comerica.Rant time.
Okay, not everyone likes sports. So why the hell would every single tv have either espn, baseball, college or pro football on? The dodgers? Ew. And the Oakland A's? I don't care how far they are in the league... I don't want to watch it. Then UCLA or the Cubs game? 
Dear 24, leave at least one tv on the news. I like being entertain with information when working out... And no, the kardashian update on E! News does not count.
Also, why do they call them 24 hour fitness when you can't access it 24 hours a day? More like 18 hour fitness. 
Honestly, planet fitness is down the street and it's half the cost for a month to month membership. I'm switching. Which this gym was like the Cali ones I'm used to. *sigh*
The equipment is mediocre, but I like that the water fountain water is cold. 
And I like.....
Nope, that about covers it.My hubby and I came here on a Saturday night because we were both starving and every other place nearby had a long wait.  That should have been a big red flag.  The food and the service were both sub-par.  Our server disappeared for long periods of time without checking on us and seemed annoyed that we were inconveniencing him by being there.  The busser kept my hubby's ice tea full but then failed to take my plate once I was done eating.  It literally sat there for the entire 20 minutes we waited for our server to bring us the check and then was still there when we left.

We started with the calamari which had a great flavor, light breading, and came with two tasty dipping sauces.  However, the calamari itself was really overcooked and rubbery.  The hubby had a pasta dish which he thought was pretty good.  But it's hard to screw up a basic rigatoni and red sauce. I ordered the eggplant napoleon.  The description sounded fantastic: eggplant, portabello mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, balsamic vinegar; all my favorites.  It arrived with a beautiful presentation (see pic) so I was really excited to try this dish. The actual flavors really fell short.  Vegetables were overcooked, cheese filling was bland, and the sauce was oily.  The dish just didn't pop.

Overall, I liked the cool, modern vibe of the place.  Though the electronic music got really old.  It ranged from some songs that were kind of techno jazz background music to some songs that were sort of like acid house music.  It was weird.  Other than that its a comfortable, cool place and I would consider giving them another chance if there weren't so many other better options in the area.In the worst economy I've seen in Arizona in 30 years, Biltmore Fashion Park has just decided to institute PAID parking at its shopping center. This is insulting to the locals who consider BFP their neighborhood mall and shop here frequently. And it favors the ultra wealthy...a valet actually told me it's his job to "protect the patron's luxury vehicles." When I asked him if my $35,000 car met his definition of luxury, he gave me a blank look. Ridiculous. The ever-widening gap between the classes isn't being helped by policies like this. Hey, BFP management...remember the French Revolution?The Denny's at this location has outstanding cooks. Everything is always nicely cooked and hot, I love the skillets. The problem is with the service, the only consistancy is that it is terrible. My observation is not on one experience or two, it is the last four out of the last five times we have been there, no coffee refills, no to go boxes, we waited and waited for ANY service to the point the server in the next section finally helped us. Management needs step up the service.Ugh... This was a pretty disappointing place.

I had a little problem with the Night Splash deal, which is basically admission for nighttime hours at a discounted price. The website says that the Night Splash tickets go on sale at the gate at 6:00PM, so I buy the tickets online earlier in the day, show up to the park at about 6 with my girlfriend and her 8 year-old kid, and they make us stand outside the gate for an hour in the 100+ heat because the Night Splash apparently doesn't start until 7:00PM. I think this place could use an adult presence. None of the employees had any customer skills and when they had 20 different pissed off parties of people who bought tickets online and apparently showed up too early, they still didn't seem to want to admit any problem. But that's what happens when even the senior employees aren't old enough to buy a beer.

Aside from that, the lines for the slides were pretty long and they don't really move people through with any efficiency. They seem to not just wait for the previous person to get out of the pool below the slide, but then clear some painted red line on the concrete before they send the next person down. What the crap? I've been to other waterparks where they just count to 5 or 10 and it seems to work fine. I don't think I could tolerate this place during daytime summer hours.

The whole facility is actually fairly nice and this place would be pretty cool if it was managed better, but for my money, I'll go to the Hilton resort by Squaw Peak. Not only is the staff more service oriented there, but you can also sip on a cocktail while you float around their lazy river tube ride.I went to the Sub Shop today for lunch. I split the chicken salad sandwich with my friend.  The bread was hard and tasted not fresh and didn't have very much chicken.  We told the owner she said that's how they received the bread when they received the order, but besides that the sandwich was perfect. So she was aware of the bread being hard, but was still selling it??? She offered to give us a discount on our next order, ok so why not give us the discount immediately.  My friend and I definitely were not satisfied with the service or sandwich.Barely mediocre food and wildly unfriendly service earn this place two stars.  They have a captive audience in state government workers given the lack of restaurant choices in the Capitol area and perhaps that explains it.  The food is generally fresh but offers little in the way of taste.  The red sauce they use has a distinctly "off" flavor.  Everything is very greasy even by the standards of Mexican food.  This place is a cut below the Isbertos, Rolibertos etc. that are everywhere in the Valley.  The staff  seem to resent your presence.  To call them unfriendly wouldn't do it justice.  I've waited forever for the food to come and then had the barely warm food almost thrown at me.  Give this place a miss.--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?
--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.
--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.

--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.
--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!
--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!
--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.
--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.
--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend.I used to come here every other week for the past few years ... After tonight... Never again...Last night was my first time at Original Hamburger Works and was most likely the last.  The employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed clueless.  When ordering and asking the order-taker basic questions about the menu, she would only quickly answer "I don't know" with a blank stare on her face.  When picking up my order at the counter, the young man just looked at me when I said thank you.  Not a good way to win over customers.  You must go over into the bar area to purchase alcoholic drinks and for some odd reason, they don't take debit cards after 7 pm.  Strange.

The food was just okay.  Being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus.  I got the Big One while my wife got the Border Burger.  The burgers were well cooked and had a good taste, but weren't outstanding.  We also ordered the half onion rings and fries basket, which was just basic fare.  

The deal-breaker came when I went to the men's room after dining.  Upon entering the hall leading to the restrooms, I noticed a foul, sewer-like smell.  After entering the restroom, I was quickly overtaken with the stench.  I've been in port-a-potties that had more pleasant smells than this.  

While the concept of this restaurant has merit, it's poorly executed, unfortunately.  It has potential, but obviously lacks good management.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at this time.The food was good ...the price is okay to me because back i would have got this for a lot less but for where am at it's good and much better than the state fair food.....and there open late that's a super plus ...just think there a bit rude that's allI guess im not scene enough for this place.  Guys in girl pants, here is your venue. Its really small, tries to combine to many different facets, and the bands they book are typically emo / pop rock bands.  On occasion theyve had a random local punk show, but for the most part this place is for the journal writing, scarf wearing, horn rimmed glasses crowd.  Some of the art is decent,  it has a kind of co-op/ food not bombs feel, and the staff is nice enough,  just not my crowd i guess.The trunk space is a semi-good place to see live shows. I have noticed that they seem to follow a strict genre of music. Keeping more to popular-punk but still underground-emo for mostly high school kids, but also like bands that cross this genre with experimental types as well. One thing about the Trunk Space, NO AC!! Damn that place is hotter than a steam room. If you like to be crowded in a small room with emo kids, welcome to the Trunk Space.AC on, Check, Beds clean, Check, Bathroom toilet area, EEWEE! Dirty Floor, pubic hairs, not cleaned, shower and faucets spotty and obviously not cleaned.  GROSS! What do they pay the room cleaners for, if they don't clean anything! It takes 5 minutes to wipe this stuff down. I would know , I am a mom that cleans her house! DUH. NO BRAINER!I wandered in here because it's across the street from the Tufesa bus station, and I had a bunch of time to kill. This place looks like it was probably a fast food chain 30 years ago, and there were a couple of positive reviews from 15 years ago up on the wall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sometimes you can find a great dive if you're adventurous. This wasn't one of those times.

I was there at breakfast time, and ordered huevos rancheros. It got corn tortillas with fried eggs on top, and some stewed vegetables on top of that. The other side of the plate was beans. The eggs were cooked well, but there must have been half a cup of vegetable liquid all over my plate. It ruined everything. I should have complained but I was too tired to bother.I was so disappointed in Pete's.

Went with a friend to get a variety & share. We had a hard time distinguishing between a few of the items we got until we bit in, & even then we weren't 100% sure which was which.

Fish 2 pc $3.70 - Thin with too much batter but a decent flavor. Wouldn't get again.
Shrimp 4 pc $3.65 - Was there even a taste to these? Wouldn't get again.
Oysters 4 pc $3.65 - Very fishy. There were actually good. I'd get these again. I liked them.
Crabettes 4 pc $3.65 - I barely remember these, that's how unimpressed I was. Was this even crab?! Wouldn't get again.
Scallops 5 pc $3.85 - Good. Might get these again if I ever went back. My friend liked these.
Chips - What word comes to mind? I think gross might describe these.
Sauce - It was ketchup! I HATE ketchup. I wanted tarter sauce. This was the biggest disappointment. I was so bummed out.

FYI it's cash only.
Also, be prepared to be approached by people asking for money or a meal if you go here, even if you're in the drive-through.It was a battle between 2 or 3 stars. 

I'll start with the good:

The price for a membership for this gym is reasonable compared to other boxing gyms that I looked at.  It is two levels, the upper level is a boxing and MMA training area with heavy bags, speed bags and a ring. The bottom level is a weight room.  

Now the not so good:

When comparing costs, although a membership at this gym is less than its competition, most other gyms include training sessions with their fees, this place did not. I was basically on my own to train myself. They do offer training sessions as a separate fee, however after paying the fees to work with a trainer it is more expensive than most other gyms that include training in their upfront fees. 

The weight room equipment is very old and limited. Both the upper and lower levels are small in size and at most times in the evenings very crowded. Most of everyone there were very young and seemed to be training on a competitive level. I being just an average guy there to train for fun and fitness didn't fit in. 

This place has some potential, however I think where it falls short is the lack of interaction I had with trainers. If I wanted to go work out on my own I would join LA Fitness for $25 per month. This place is run by the owner who is also the head trainer and I just think his time is spread pretty thin. Like many masters of their trade, they are great at what they do, but may lack other skills that it takes to run a business.
 
If you are just a regular person who is not looking to train for a professional fight, but would like to use boxing to improve your fitness, you may want to look elsewhere.this is a place by my work that I eat at from time to time (over the past 12 years), mainly cause it's convenient!  the food is decent, but not great.  the menu is really odd, instead of a build your own sandwich menu they have 60+ (yes, 60) pre-made ones, and the difference between some is only something simple like mayo... 

if you want a sub and are in the area, it's worth a stop, but i wouldn't go out of your way for itWe brought my husband's brand new BMW 335i in just last month after he was rear-ended on the freeway. They told us it would be two weeks, two and a half max. Over a month later we finally have the car back but the interior, which used to have a nice new car smell, now reeks of BO from the workers. Gross. Also, when we dropped the car off, they had a deal on their website boasting 50% off your deductible up to $500, yet when my husband went to pick up his car yesterday no such deal was offered. They should have honored the deal that was advertised when we dropped the car off at least - then take into account it took twice as long as they predicted and we were paying for a rental car that entire time! 

 I've also taken my BMW X3 to them when I was hit from the side and it took twice as long with my vehicle as well. Their communication during the process leaves much to be desired and my car still has a rattle ever since the accident. Definitely not ideal - but if you have a ton of time on your hands to wait around for your car, dont care if you get screwed out of promotions, or your car is returned with a digusting odor or rattle then feel free to take your car here.My hair cut - no - TRIM at this salon took two and a half hours.  Granted, I did get some special deep conditioning treatment that had to sit on my head for  30 minutes - but that still left me with a two hour long hair cut.  Geez lousie.

The stylist was obviously very new and maybe trying to impress her boss who was near by.  She was explaining to me every.single.thing. she was doing and why, and then explained every single product she was using.  She was a nice, sweet gal - she just took forever.  

I had to postpone plans I had that evening because this easy hair cut took well over the 90 minutes I had budgeted.Kebab lunch plates for $18! Get real! Even the $12 lamb gyro was not worth the price. The food is average in my opinion, the service slow & rude. I can't imagine why people would rave about this place. Have you people never eaten anywhere better?

Prices are not listed on their website menu, so make sure you ask before you order! A coworker of mine ordered 2 menu items totaling about $25 and was VERY disappointed with the quality of the food. Mine wasn't much better. Yeah, there's some nice Persian rugs hanging on the wall, but the place is tiny and has no ambiance.

UPDATE: I've eaten at this place a few times now and basically stick to the $5 lunch menu. For $5 the lamb gyro and the falofal are pretty good.This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.  A bit heavier on the salt and sauces than I would like though.  I tend to go to my old standbys Great Wall or my newer loves Nee House or South China knowadays.FRIENDLY, FAST SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD. NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITE. 

--eggs overcooked
--oj watery but tasty
--food not greasy or oily
--everything just a little bit healthier than you'll find elsewhere.A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it. 

The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a "Good Day Sunshine" breakfast vibe.

We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has "The Healthier Side" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch. 

The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal. 

The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out. 

Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better. 

If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger.First off the front door was locked, we were somehow "supposed" to know not to use it and to go around the back.  Then no one actually wanted to help us at the counter.  When someone finally did ask us what we wanted, it took FOREVER.  And all we got was boring old ice cream.  The place seemed cool on the inside but we didn't feel at all welcomed and won't be going back.On a hot night a couple weeks ago the hubs and I decided that ice cream sounded like a great way to cool off and so we decided to give Mary Coyle's a try.  

The service was good - our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  The ice cream however, left a lot to be desired. Now, I don't need crazy organic, natural, churned by hand, hipster ice cream that comes in all sorts of artsy flavors.  I'm perfectly happy with regular old ice cream (we got chocolate and mint chocolate chip).  But I'm not into super sugary, artificially colored and flavored, modified dairy product.  And I like my waffle cones crisp and crunchy not soft and chewy.  

While I was hoping this place might remind me a bit of Aglamesis (my favorite old school ice cream parlor in Cincinnati), sadly it did not.  They do certainly try and they provide service with a simile but they need to work on the quality of their product.I had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road. The ice cream wasn't great; the flavors seemed off, and the texture was grainy. The cone was flavorless and fell apart before I finished the first scoop. For the price, it didn't really seem worth it.Well I wouldn't really call this place a "cocktail lounge" like sayyyy Side Bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. Even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. I am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! I'm not sure but this place KIND of reminds me of River City Pockets with less pool tables?? If this was like the only option available I'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice. I'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep.I used to come here often when I was married and lived in the area, my husband and I loved to play pool here with friends.  I don't know if I was looking at life through rose colored glasses back then but the Hidden House seemed so much more pleasing than it does today.  

I live in the east valley and my friend lives in the west valley so when he wanted to meet up to shoot some pool I recommended the Hidden House.  When I opened the door I thought "oh shit, this was a mistake."  The place just looks sad inside, like where people go when they need to cry in their beer or contemplate suicide.Prime was not.

It was not yummy. It was not inexpensive. It did not refill soda drinks. It had no other customers.  The lady who met us at the front was expecting us to get take out. Why? There were plenty of tables and it was clean. 

We stayed, we ordered Hot Thai Soup, House chicken, House seafood, lemonade, soda and Thai tea with cream. The rice was a very small portion, the seafood was inedible, because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off, not worth $16 for sure!  The chicken was like it had sat on a buffet for hours and I'm not sure what they made the sauce out of, it wasn't to our liking. The soup tasted of mustard not lemongrass and chili or coconut or what you might expect from a Thai hot soup. Thai Rama, Malee's...others have better soup.

I expected a lot better from the reviews. I understand why it's empty now and I'm surprised it's been here so long. It's only because they handled the order fine, service was fine and the place is clean that they got 2 stars. 

I would not try them again for food, unless i got really desperate and too lazy to drive farther than their location which is really close to home. I'll probably try the China Buffett down the street before I return to Prime. Very disappointing.First, the food: it was pretty good. Not spectacular. We had the shrimp with lemongrass, the Mongolian beef, fried rice and orange chicken. All was OK nothing amazing or nothing that you could not find at any nicer Chinese food joint. 
The service: however, was flipping horrible. There was literally one person working the dining room in all functions, busboy (girl) hostess and waiter/server everything. The food was slow coming and no one other than my party and all the other parties in the restaurant who were also waiting to be served noticed or cared. I will not be returning to this barely adequate Chinese food place at all, particularly when there are so many better alternatives right down the street.I have to say I went to this location because of their hours and for the Yelp reviews I read.  I had set an appointment and when I got there only one other person was out in the waiting area. I walked right to the counter and was asked to fill out some papers which was expected since it was my first time.

I finished the papers in less than 5 minutes and then I sat in the lobby for 30-35 minutes. Another woman walked in and told the lady at the counter she wanted to bring her dog in because he was acting strange. Her words "He was going up to a friend and wanting to be pet by him, he must be sick because he is shy" and then she got brought back with her pet!  I was already sitting there a good 15 minutes, REALLY?

 I was getting a bit upset because, well, I don't have all the time in the world and just wanted to get my 2 dogs looked at.
After 30 minutes I finally walked up to the counter and said "You do know I had an appointment at 11, right?" 

Finally they brought me back to the examination room...I sat there for another 30 minutes! I couldn't believe it. My blood was boiling and I was to the point where I started to put my dogs back in the kennel to leave.  As I was packing them up  a tech came in to start off the temp and weight. She was very friendly and the reason why I gave more than one star.
The tech did her thing and left...and there I was sitting waiting for the vet for another 10 minutes!

Here I am 70 minutes after my appointment and still have NOT seen the vet, I missed another appointment I had because of how long it took.

When setting up the appointment for the next visit I wasn't given an card or anything to remind me of when it is. I have no idea when the next appointment is, I may have missed it but that doesn't matter, I don't plan on returning.

I did get a call the next day about the stool but they weren't sure if the samples had been mixed up because the adult dog had parasites that a puppy would have and the puppy had some that the dog should have so they just generally treated them both.

When I went to pick up the medicine the person at the counter couldn't tell me what I needed to do to give 1 mil of the medicine to the puppy. Another tech happily assisted me and gave me a syringe, thankfully she was there. 

When I asked the guy at the counter what kind of parasites I was battling the guy said "I don't know"... I asked if it was in their records and he said "No"...wait...what???? So I stood there thinking he was finding out for me...no, he was doing something else...I took the medicine and they didn't even say "Make sure when you're done you bring a sample back in to find out if they are better" It has been a week since the 7 day medicine ran out and I haven't got a call asking if all was OK and if I'm going to bring in the stool samples.

I really don't feel comfortable with this place, and I'm upset that it didn't work out....I had better hopes to find a vet in the neighborhood since I'm new to it.

Time to find a new one. If anyone has found something in the area that's you went to, please let me know by message.Cheap food and Cheaper Margaritas do not a good restaurant make. At $1.75 you can drink a lot of Margaritas and pretend the food is good. Soon the buzz will wear off and you'll have a headache and think you ate Mexican buffet at Panchos. Friendly service thoughYes, the place is inexpensive, and let's just say, you get what you pay for.  The last couple of times that I was there, I was assigned to the same stylist.  She never paid much attention to what she was doing.  She was too busy checking into everyone's conversations and looking at the door for customers entering.  Needless to say, I had very uneven haircuts after both visits.  Another stylist that I had at one time, overcharged me $5 extra for a product that I purchased.  Unfortunately, I didn't learn this until I returned home later on in the day.  I know of other people from my area who have experienced similar problems with this neighborhood salon.  Inexpensive, coupon, or not, I don't plan to return to this place.For real.. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh.. Cheese... Lettuce. Sour cream. Overall plain as fugg.. 

I decided to give them another try, cuz I was craving some damn menudo, and no place has menudo during the week. Me and my coworker Fernando hit up the FBH at 11am. I ordered menudo.. Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, "skuse me..deyyzz supposed ta be sep-rit oah-duz."

the clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!"

The shit was disrespectful as hell.

Whatever.. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle.. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre-made soup.. pour it into a styrofoam container.. put a lid on it.. put it in a brown bag.. toss a pre-made baggie of onion and cilantro in.. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread.. toss that shit in the bag.. and shout out a nigga name.

Nah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes!!! Then I took that shit out of the bag! "WTF is this???" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH.. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here-We visited this cinema while in Phoenix, I was a bit iffy on the area, and all the kids hanging around outside b4 and after the film.  Then while in the film there were young kids in the theatre running around, etc.  This is a place if I were to go to a film while in Phoenix again, i most likely would go somewhere else from this place.So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies...

OK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then....

I. Entered. The. Theatre.

Gulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty. 

Just seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street. 

I may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!OK...the Yelp reviews drew me in for a try...like a mouse to cheese.

So it was no surprise when I arrived to find this place in a pretty poor facility...I can deal with this. No problem. I love dives, mom and pop shops, local back alley eateries, tacos stands in Mexico.....mystery meat and all...I live for this stuff. 

However, I was surprised with a few things:
To start...GET  A DUMPSTER WITH A LID.  The entire parking lot smells of  rotten garbage.  Unappetizing, unsanitary, and disgusting.

2nd...put some fresh paint in this place and clean the bathrooms already.  The walls and ceilings looked to be painted sometime during the Ming Dynasty.  The sink and soap dispenser were caked with what looked liked decades of residue.  I felt that washing my hands might actually make them dirtier.

Ok...now for the good stuff.  
1) The staff was incredible.  I have NO experience with Vietnamese food which a majority of the menu consists of.  The waitress (and I am assuming owner) stopped and spent significant time with Ash and I.  She recommend a variety of dishes based upon our tastes.  
2) The value was excellent.  The price point is under the $10 mark and the portions were large.
3) The quality of the food was excellent.  The egg rolls, spring rolls, noodle dishes, and meats were tasty.

In the end...I don't think I will be back.  While the food was great and the staff was wonderful...the facility was too much for me.My friend and I came to this place cause it seemed as though this was the only other decent Vietnamese place to eat at other than Pho Thanh. The reason we came here is we happened to be craving these foods on a tuesday and apparantly.. Pho Thanh is closed on Tuesdays. Who knew! The service was good, a lot of seating, the menu was decent as well, but both of our dishes we got were just okay.. We've been to many vietnamese places.. so we knew we weren't getting the best unfortunately. I had gotten Pho Tai Nam, everything just seemed mediocre.. the broth, meat.. Eh.
My friend got Com Thit Nuong. The meat was cut very thin, and into rectangles.. and it wasnt as tasty as it could have been. Again.. just okay. 
Prices weren't bad either but I wouldn't come back here for a second time.I really wanted to like this place and maybe it was because I didn't get the pho, but the quality of the food was just bad.  I ordered the bahn mih and one of the vermecelli plates with grilled meat and egg rolls... and it was just alright.  The price was about right for comparable food but I was definitely expecting A LOT more of the bahn mih (it sucked compared to Lee's Sandwiches; the bread was too bready and NOT a baguette but instead that used for a sub sandwich).  The neighborhood was also sketch.  I came here on a weekday around 3pm and there were some strange characters hanging out in front.OVerall the food was good, however the service was crappy!  We waited forever to get someone to not only bring us water, but to take our order.  WHen I got up to look for someone  they were sitting at a table just relaxing.  Our food was literally tossed to us without any regard to whom it was going to.  My friend asked for two seperate items on the menu and was told "they were out".  for two items, one after the other?  I have had PHO at many places.  I WILL NOT be returning, my recommendation would be to go to MAXIM  up the street on 19th ave and Osborn.  This place was the pits!Went based on the Yelp rating, and if I were to somehow go back, it would be an "order-out". Even just looking for it, it was hard to believe that a place rated so high on Yelp would be in such a crappy area and mall! The inside just seems dirty, the windows are hard to see out of, it looks like nothing has been moved around in years. If the food knocks you out, you get over that grime and dust, but the food here was just medocre.  Nothing great, nothing bad, just ok. We had pho, bbq pork, spring rolls, egg rolls and noodles.  Charge me more, clean the place, and maybe I'd come back and give it another shot!Went in around 2pm, had the #1 combo, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl.  Was way too expensive for what I got, and the Egg Roll was microwaved, not fresh or crunchy.  I would not recommend this place.  There are a few other asian restaurants that are marginally better in the area.  The only plus here is that its the only rice bowl place at this intersection.This mall is hit or miss. It isnt as big as Metrocenter or others, which depending on who you are, can be both a good and bad thing. It had Walmart, Costco, and Target-the three major retailers in this country. The Harkins is still new and a decent place to catch a film if you are willing to fork ridiculous prices on food. Big 5, Game Stop,Radio Shack, Walgreens, Payless, and Foot Locker resider here too.

Good selection on fast food; Mickey D's in Walmart, Carls Jr(no green burrito), KFC, Taco Bell, South China Express( knockoff of Panda), Starbucks in Target, and a good buffet in Mandarin.

Overall, decent selection of big chainy stores, but problem is the people who hang around here and the guards who harrass you and spend time joking around then making it a safe place. Also, it is in need of a renovation as it is very bland inside. While light rail gave it the shot of adreniline it needed, it needs more.I use Yelp to not only vent about bad places but also find new places to experience. After living down the street (northern/19th ave) from this place for 2 years I thought Ill give it a shot..like so many other Yelpers on here..it seems this is the kind of place that sorta gets lost..until you pass it enough times to notice it and then you just want to try it.

I went in and it's literally your neighborhood bar with food. That's not always a bad thing because some bars have awesome if slightly unhealthy food. 3 TV's all doing football, many many beers on tap and overall a nice ambiance feel. DEFINITELY a neighborhood sports bar.

I waited about 5 minutes for the only waitress to give me a menu and when I explained it was my first time she grunted and walked off. So I went to the bar and just ordered. Do you know when you go to someplace the first time and you think you want to eat there but that vibe just says "go home and eat it"..well that's what I got..It wasnt a bad place and I already ordered the food..but it wasn't friendly either. I am sure the regulars have a grand old time but I just wanted all that impressed with the service or hospitality. Maybe Ill go back for karaoke if the food is good.

My major major pet peeve: .50 for take out on the bill. I know they want me to consume as much beer as possible..they already charged me $2 for a pepsi. But a take out fee...on a sunday afternoon...with the bar empty after the football game is over...ridiculous. I skimped on the tip because of it and she let me know how unwelcome I really was at that point.

gonna go eat the food now..had to write this first.

2/3lb cheesburger, 1 mozz beer sticks, 1 pepsi plus $1 tip, $.50 takeout was 18 bucks.

AFTER EATING:
I had the cheese sticks and they were really really good..I think they are called beer cheese pints..Excellent 100%

The burger was a good burger..it wasnt the best ever, it wasnt the worst ever..It was good. It was totally greasy as you would expect but it did stay on the bun the whole time. The cheese was interesting..it didnt feel like fake cheese but tasted kinda like it..so I dont know.

I might go back but overall first impressions were just 2 stars, I say this. if you want a neighborhood bar with solid good and excellent beers this is your place. If you want a family outing stick to McDonaldsIt's ok they have a great selection of things for you aquarium but the fish selection is so so and prices on pumps filter etc are out of control.The review by Jessica S. is correct -- the dressing for the salads is delicious and they put it on the side...so that is two positive things for the two stars I gave them.  However - if I pay over $10.00 for a salad...I want something OTHER than iceburg lettuce (even if it's just a little romaine and/or spinach) and pitted olives.  I asked for no grilled onions and light on the pepper -- when I received my plate, their were onions and peppers all over the place.  If you're going to offer "salads" as a main course...they should be worth it.  That was the worst $11.00 salad I've ever had.I had a coupon for $17.99 so decided it was worth a try!  I was told there was 1 car in front of me.  I said that i was on lunch for an hour and he said no problem   So I sat and waited.  And waited.  40 min later they still hadnt taken my car in.  The man behind the desk was on the phone for the last 20 min do I couldn't ask.  Finally someone else walks behind the desk and he hangs up the phone.  And then e gets up and gives my keys to a serviceman. So I ha r been sitting here for 40 min and you didnt even give my keys in?  It's now been over an hour and my car is still up on the lift. I can see them actually working on it now.  Took a little over an hour.  I paid by money and walked outside to get the car.  I had to ask if everything was ok with the car - usually they come and tell you that you need x & y done to you car.  The guy mumbled its fine and walked away. 

Wouldn't recommend this place if you want a quick oil change!The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2.I just moved into this area in December 2012 and met "Nita Margarita" out shopping.  She encouraged me to at least try La Pinata because I was looking for that ultimate in Mexican food.  As I drove into the parking lot I was a little skeptical but, once inside, it was quaint, albeit a little too dark.  Using my flashlight app (yes it was that dark), I spotted the guacamole which is my absolute fav.  Our waitress came and took our drink orders and left.  After some time she returned with our drinks and started to take our order.  I asked for a side of guacamole to go with the chips as I cannot eat salsa.  We both ordered and waited...and waited......and waited.  No guacamole, nothing.  The place was not crowded or I would have taken that into consideration.  After about 20 minutes our food arrived so I again requested the guacamole.  About half way through my tostada, the guacamole came but by then we were out of chips.  The tostada was absolutely delicious and, once I did get my guacamole and chips, I enjoyed those as well.  Even though the food was really good, I have been to other good authentic Mexican restaurants that had much better service.  I am generally very postive but this hour long meal just did not set well.this place is falling apart...outdatedUpdate: 05/01 For some reason it didn't give me an update button; only edit...so I am adding the new one above: 

Another day and I continue to be dumbfounded by this location. In March I used to order the 6" breakfast sandwich and drink at the $3 combo price. That promo was not there in April in lieu of the buy one get one free special that this location never seemed to get correct. 

Today is May and I ordered my standard 6" flatbread bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. As I progressed down the line I noticed the $3 combo sign was back up. In every other Subway location when checking out they ask if you want a combo, and if you say yes they push combo, and the register gives the combo price. After seeing the sign that says 6" sandwich and 21 oz drink $3, I removed a 21oz cup. The lady rang it up and said $5.50. I asked how do I get the combo? She said oh, you have to tell me that. Then frustrated she hit several buttons until it reflected the price. Shouldn't the combo be a standard item? All other times they ask if the customer wants a combo. If the combo is a sandwich and a medium drink and a customer orders and sandwich then takes a medium cup, shouldn't that be a clue? Either way, I think this location needs some additional training. 



04/30/12: There seems to be confusion on the April promo of buy one get one free. It says get a free 6" sandwich when you buy any 6" sandwich before 9. My first attempt I ordered the sandwich and nothing was mentioned. I came back for lunch and asked how it worked. The lady said the customer has to tell them in the morning, they enter a code, and it prints on the receipt. No free one that day. 

I went back again to the same location and upon ordering my breakfast sandwich I asked about the free one. She said I could get it now. I don't want it now. I want it at lunch. I don't want it sitting on my desk attracting germs nor do I want to re-heat it to kill said germs. After saying I didn't want it now, she said okay. It wasn't entered and actually I didn't even get a receipt :-/

The product line is the same as every Subway. The challenge is the shop is small with limited seating and fills up quickly at lunch.I decided to grab dim sum after I watched Bizarre on the food channel and Andrew was in China eating all these delicious Chinese dim sim. Typically, I go to Golden Buddha in the Chinese Cultural center, but I was recommended that Great Wall has better dim sum. 

Please keep in mind that I admit, I went during the end of the rush (1:00pm) on a Sunday so I had appropriate expectations. However, there was only 2 carts going around trying to sell their leftovers from the rush and was really disappointed. We ordered the chicken feet, pork bun, hak-kwah, bok choy and it was just okay. In fact, I would have to say it was quite bland and the sauce on some of the dishes were salty and tasteless. The chicken feet I usually get is cut into pieces and not battered but the way they served it at the Great Wall, compromised my gag reflex. I am not one to be shy of eating different parts of animals, in fact ox tail is one of my favorite meat but my stomach could not handle their chicken feet. 

I would assume we would have received better service and tastier food if we had gotten there a little earlier but I think I am going to stick with my usual place. Flagging the carts down continuously was a little more stressful than what I want when eating dim sum.This must be a dim sum hot spot because we had to wait 20 minutes or more for a table.  I was weary after stepping in to this dingy place but the crowds of Asians reassured me that it must be ok.
The carts were few and far between. I wasn't impressed. Maybe I was so hungry and crabby by the time we got seated.  Who knows? 
Nothing stood out as great or horrible.  So, take your chances and try their dim sums.We were traveling (from California) and my wife needed treatment for an ear infection that had started before the trip.  We found Advanced Urgent Care through the web and elected to go to one (they have 8 in the Phoenix area) closest to our hotel.  We even called ahead for an appointment and showed up on time.  I guess it's good we had the appointment - that kept the waiting time down to only about two hours (!!).  My wife was then seen by a physician's assistant who actually had a specialty in ear, nose and throat, and seemed to know what she was doing in diagnosing the problem, giving advice and providing a prescription that we could be filled nearby.  The ear infection eased up after treatment, so I'd say the treatment was OK.

On the other hand, there are some troubling things about this place, beyond the long wait even with an appointment.  Like the first thing you see walking in the door - a junk food vending machine selling chips, candy and the like.  Almost right next to the registration desk.  Now maybe Arizona is not as enthusiastic about healthy eating and preventive care as some parts of California - I can accept that because we Californians can be a bit obsessive at times.  But for a doctor's office to be pushing junk food as soon as the patient enters the building (and I'm sure the corporate owner of Advanced Urgent Care gets a cut of the vending machine sales) is just barely better than having a cigarette vending machine in the corner.  It's putting profits before public health and that's never a good thing.

The other thing I found troubling was the TV in the waiting room - set for a religious channel - not exactly welcoming to people with different religious beliefs.  Surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that.  But then, I suppose, they'd have to remove the junk food vending machine for lack of use, and that would be bad for the bottom line.

So, to conclude, the treatment for my wife's fairly straightforward problem was competent, but I'm not sure this chain of urgent care centers really has taken a mission of public health to heart.The food was decent, but prices were stupid expensive. The lunch portions were minimal for $8.50, the 1/2# fajitas were $20. Small sides of guacamole are $2.25. Given the early 90's cheese decor, your money would be well spent elsewhere.I see some great reviews here, but I have to say that I did not experience the friendliness here that others have.  I walked in with my son, with a couple bikes in the back of my truck to possibly sell.  I walked in and looked directly at the gentleman behind the counter and gave the obligatory nod, smile and hello.   the nod, the smile, and hello were NOT returned.  I inquired about possibly selling my bikes.  He didn't even look at them, and they were nicer than the used bikes i saw in the parking lot.  He immediately snapped back that HE WAS NOT BUYING BIKES RIGHT NOW.  okay buddy, relax,  i just asked.  There ARE USED BIKES IN FRONT, my bad dude!  I had a badly warped rim on my mountain bike.  I asked him about that, he said he could fix it.  I brought it in and he said it was shot.  I figured that and I purchased a rim from him.  Thought he was gonna replace it for me.  NO DICE.  He just handed me the rim and told me to have a nice day.  He OBVIOUSLY did not like me as a customer, so I guess I have no reason to go back.  Thanks alot buddy.  I'll buy my kid a brand new bike elsewhere, now that I've sold his gently used, but outgrown of Mongoose bicycle on craigslist.  I won't be buying the $240 Diamondback bicycle he saw in your shop, at your shop.  A little friendliness goes along way.  This seems pretty common in the bicycle shop world.Only because it was next door to my hotel, and never, never again!

Call me bloomin' Idiot!Outback Steakhouse is alright.  They have good salads.  That's about all I can say.

Their prices are decent if you just want the basic steak meal.

Overall, Meh.  I've experienced better.Not a good experience!  My takeout took too long and they got the order wrong!

I was hoping to pick up a quick takeout so ordered from the hostess and waited. The restaurant was practically empty so expected a short wait.  But after 20 minutes I asked about my order. She came back with it--said it had been bagged and ready to go, but the kitchen didn't know who it belonged to. Huh? How often do they have takeouts?

At home with my order I find that one salad has no topping at all--just lettuce. So I call and talk to the manager who answered the phone. He gave me various excuses, like the toppings are not plentiful so maybe that's why I'm not seeing them. Ridiculous!  One salad was obviously topped and one was not. It took awhile to get this thru to him. And why had my order been sitting awhile? No answer to that one.

No sorry for the inconvenience from him. Manager did offer me another salad though. Supposedly next time I visit Outback will give me a free salad. 

Not good customer service. Outback needs to wake up!I have stayed at my fair share of Sheratons, and other higher and lower caliber hotels.  From a Sheraton, I expect a great bed, decent cheeseburgers, room service, and a friendly staff.  I usually get great service, and it's a welcome respite from a challenging journey......

Then I cam to Phoenix.  The front desk staff when I checked in was snooty and not friendly and very unwilling to accommodate a minor request to keep the charge on the card i used to book the room, rather than putting it on a different card.  They refused to do it.  Here's the ironic thing.  If i had failed to show up, they would have had no problem charging the card for one night's stay, per their cancellation policy.  I am going to chalk up the bad service to one off night at an otherwise reliable chain.

Here's the other funky thing....The hotel keys were metal, but they don't have grooves like a regular key.  They're electronically coded.  Odd.  Very Odd.

The best part was I had a HUGE shared balcony off of my room.  Since I was there about 12 hours, I didn't really get to enjoy it, but that would be cool for a longer stay.This place is way overpriced, as far as the steakenburger part goes.  Bread's meh, the philly steak is meh, all in all - meh...  But very overpriced.  Think 8 bucks for a steakenburger (burger with philly meat as well) fries and drink.1) Recently took a piece Nick had framed to Aaron Bros because the glass broke. When the guy took the frame apart, we found out Nick had fixed the print to the matte with SCOTCH TAPE!!!!!! That is a huge no-no, I used to work in a frame shop long ago and I know that that is total amateur hour. It's the equivalent of your mechanic fixing a hose on your car with duct tape. Even if the glass had not broken, eventually the print would have come loose and the piece would have needed repair.

2) Lacks imagination. His favorite color is black and so he recommends black for EVERYTHING when it comes to frame and matte.

3) You know what, it's your right to listen to whatever  radio stations you want in your own business... and it's my right to go do business elsewhere when the whole time I'm trying to talk to you I have to listen to, and speak up to compete with, the extremist right-wing AM radio hosts peddling their hatred and anger in the work area in back at an unacceptable, blaring level of volume. If you only want business from dittoheads, mission accomplished.PetSmart kind of irritates me in general (high prices, questionable merchandise, the whole Banfield scam...) but this location goes beyond irritating. They never have what I want in stock.I had a yearning for a Carne Asada Burrito and didnt want to drive all the way down to Central Phoenix.  I found Caramba's on Yelp and tried it out.  The portions on the combo with rice and beans were small, and the taste was not very memorable.  I would not go back or recommend.Went to Caramba's for dinner.  This was our first time and we went on the recommendation of friends.

First impressions.  When we walked in, about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied.  The restaurant was VERY clean.  Lots of tables, no kitsch decor, and an order/pick up at the counter type set up.   

The lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems.  We asked about ordering chips (they are listed on the on-line menu), and the lady said they were included, and gave us a couple of bowls of chips along w/ our drink cups.

They have a salsa bar with several different salsas available.  Medium smooth (hot sauce), medium chunky, hot, fire roasted, and pico de gallo.

The fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good, but nothing special.  The chips however, were well past their prime (stale).

We ordered a #2 combo plate (2 hard beef tacos), #6 combo plate (red chile burrito), and a bean and cheese burrito.

The food came fast and hot.  That's about the only good things I can say.  The red chile burro had a lot of meat and grease, but no flavor.  The red chile it self was very thin and watery.  The rice was bland.  The beans had the flavor of being fresh out of a can.  The tacos were also packed w/ meat, once again without flavor.  The same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos.

My son ate about 1/2 of the bean and cheese burrito, and didn't want to take the rest home, and I didn't blame him.  He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a bean and cheese burritos, and he didn't like the beans either.

Maybe if we would have had one of their margaritas or cheap beer that many people rave about we would have liked it more.

I would rate almost any of "berto" places above Caramba when it comes the the flavor of the food.  I would rather have traveled down Bell Road to Mixteca.

My advice, if you want fresh, tasty, fast Mexican food.  Go to the nearest Carolinas.

I'm giving 2 stars, the restaurant was spotless, and the iced tea was fresh and very good.This location is not the best example of macayo's. My wife and boys love mexican food and I'm always game - usually macayo's puts on a good meal at decent prices and that's why this was a place we would visit once every month or two...not anymore. Service was okay - no problems there, however the food quality has fallen off a bit. Salsa was great - chips ehhh - dry and salty. Over the years I've had everything on this menu and it's hasn't changed - except for the smaller portions paired with a plate full of bland rice and beans...Chimi was small and I was amazed how little chicken was inside it...it was okay but, I was looking for more food and flavor.  The bill for two adults and two kids 50-60 bucks - too expensive for a marginal meal.

Not not impressed anymore with the food here, especially when prices are up and we want a bang for our buck in this economy...

Haven't been to the one in scottsdale in a while but, I was very happy there - much better than thunderbird...It had been a few years since I was last here and had enjoyed the food. So when my friend picked this place for her Birthday lunch I was excited to go. The place wasn't crowded which was nice. Our waitress was very friendly. I ordered a chile relleño and red chile cheese enchilada with refried beans. Although the portions were great they were very bland. No kick from either chile. Even adding salt didn't help. I was disappointed in the lunch. I will go back one more time to make sure it wasn't an off day. But if not I will never go again.Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!Why no matter if you eat there or get it togo the burgers are never warm? I am not a fan of the Sonic... :(Not impressed.  Small portions and I would say less than "authentic" tasting.  This is more like a fast-food Mexican place, and the people that work there act like they are working in a fast-food place.  Not friendly at all.  Counter ordering and get your own drinks.  I would not recommend -- there are so many better places.Let me start off by saying this... Any established marine, boat repair joint that has a lot, warehouse or shop, a multitude of employees, and parts on hand that requires inventory, has to make a certain amount of money to stay in business, pay their rent, and make payroll to their employees. That being said, I haven't found, nor heard of a reputable boat/marine repair joint that doesn't over charge. OK... That being said, I have taken my boat (s) here twice now for some extensive work, and both times the estimate came out to be over twice the amount I was quoted. Yeah- They seem to to do very good work. But, if a plumber came over and told me it was 200 bucks to put in a new sink, and then finished and said it was going to be 600 dollars, I'd be frickin' outraged! This is the way it is with these places, and this is how it's been BOTH times I have taken my watercraft to this establishment. Won't be returning.Bring cash only. Good for an after dinner drink.I have been to several different Romano's locations and I was very upset with my recent experience at this location. When we first walked in it smelled like sewer. It was disgusting. So we opted to sit outside as it was really nice out. Our sever was slow and kept forgetting things and then our food came out cold! That was not cool, especially considering they were very slow at that time. It was just a bad experience and I will avoid this location in the future.Had dinner tonight, started with a bowl of cold mushroom soup that tasted like the cook dropped the pepper mill into the soup. Then had a chicken Caesar salad.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side, not because they put alot on it, because I don't think they put any on it. 

Hope served us and she was the only reason I gave this nights experience 2 starsMeh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this locationthis is across the street from me.. 

UMMM it just looked scary and it looked like the food was out there forever and i was Not about to eat any of it. i walked in.. and walked out.. 

im a little bias though. ive lived in Korea and lived in Japan.. i know good "Oriental" food when i see it and ... this wasnt.The restaurant itself is a generic, sterile looking hole in the wall. 
Clean and the staff is friendly.

Full Belly "used to have" one of the best French Dips in the area... My how the mighty have fallen.

I am a sucker for a good French Dip and Full Belly "used to be" be 5 stars. Their French Dip used to consist of a fresh bun, a generous pile of real unprocessed sliced roast beef and a pretty good au jus.

They changed.
For the worse.
The French Dip may still be on a fresh bun. but the lighter softer cheaper flavorless roll. The kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor. They also switched to a tasteless, processed style of roast beef that makes the fast food chain that starts with "Ar" and ends with "by's" taste like prime rib at Morton's Steakhouse. The au jus may have been a generic beef broth poured out of a can with no seasoning.

To be fair, I have had other items and they were all good in the past, but I am fearful the other menu items have suffered the same fate and am not going to spend my money to find out when there are too many other options in the area...the place that starts with "Ar" and ends with "by's" is just down the street.Went for dinner ---- it was meh.  Lots of food but not great.  Crab puffs were greasy, hot and sour soup didn't have much to it, orange chicken was so/so, chicken chow mein was greasy tasting, and the egg rolls were horrible.  And to cap it all off, service  was terrible - nobody communicated with anyone, lots of mistakes on our small order for 4 people.  They weren't busy. 

There are lots of other restaurants in town - I won't be coming back to Bamboo Grill.It's Denny's! friendly service, food was Meh? Nothing to write home about, my Bfast potatoes we hot and Ice cold... wanted to B**CH but just passed on eating them and left...I have frequented this Chili's a couple of times. The very first time I visited I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter was genuine and so friendly. I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes. The food is always good however, and I will more than likely still return.I have had Cox high-speed Internet for more than 10 years. The service is reliable and the technical support, when I have needed it, is awesome, so this would be a 5-star review if it wasn't for problems with Cox's online customer service. 

Cox's website does not provide you with the ability to do basic account management tasks, like delete an expired credit card. Every other website I do business with allows you to view credit cards, and add and delete payment options. Because of this shortcoming, I had to call Cox's phone customer service (and you can only reach them during their business hours), step through the automated attendant, and ask a customer service rep to delete my expired credit card. 

I have had similar problems in the past that I should have been able to take care of online that I have had to call and ask a CSR to resolve. Frustrating for me, and expensive for Cox, so I would think they would address those kinds of issues.Salon was very warm. Might have been heat from the windows. Blah. And their selection of polishes of China Glaze and O P I were very limited and what was there was old, half empty and separating. My technician was friendly but did not wear gloves. During the soak, a part from the tub came loose and started rattling (which the technician promptly fixed. The salon was clean but did not have a welcoming feeling. Walls are painted white with a lot of mirrors. Chair message was ok. There are too many better shops to visit. This was ok for a quick pedicure.Ok, when I feel like having fast food and maybe include a fish taco or something, this is a place that comes to mind. I've made the drive here many times but honestly, their service is horrible lately. You can be the only one in line and they'll forget numerous items! It's gotten so bad that I've actually made an effort to contact corporate about it and have received no response. Seems like it's not a big deal but in the past 6-8 months I've given them many chances and have been disappointed 8 times out of 10. We'll see if they make any changes...as for now, it's true mexican food at one of the 'berto's for me...Haven't ever order from Sardello's before. The email confirm said the order was placed & paid for it at 6:30pm with 54  minutes delivery time. However the food never arrived. I just called back a 9:30 pm (3 hours later) to check on the pie order. The guy tells me they have a wrong address but a right phone number. They clamied to have called to confirm the address but my cell phone shows, no incoming calls from Sardella's. If didn't leave a message.  I discussed my disappointment with the lack of a followup and no pizza thr  or remedies for a first time customer, out four hours of time. I will ee hours later. They offered no remedies or apologies to appease the situation. They just asked if I still wanted to order the pizza. Not sure about these guys. Reserving an extra star because I haven't tasted the pie yet. I still ordered it but was put off by the lack of ownership of the situation. Bad first time experience.First visit here. I want to be able to say good things, so some of the positives....

~Our server was pleasant. She gave us good service and checked on us a few times.
~The menu has a nice selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
~Breakfast is served all day.

Having said that, this place is dated. The sign outside said they remodeled, but it looks like a place my mom worked in the seventies. 

The food is okay. Mostly homestyle, blue plate special kind of entrees. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. It was a nice size with sliced chicken, sliced tomatoes, hard boiled egg, and cheese on iceberg lettuce. Overall, it was fresh, but the chicken had absolutely no seasoning. My friend suggested they don't season things due to the number of elderly that eat here. The cheese was imitation cheese, which I don't like. We also ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with a side of peaches. It had quite a bit of meat on it, but the bun was soggy causing it to fall apart.

Prices seem high for the quality of food, however they do have breakfast specials and free ice cream from 11am-2pm.

I might consider coming back to try their breakfast, but doubt it.Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend.First (and only) Half of Review: 

I happened into this dive bar/grill recently since it's near my NoPho / Ghettro-Center 'hood. 

Stackers gets points for having a few different beers on tap (Bass, I can't remember the rest) along with the regular boring finds. That's all I was there for at the time. 

I did not eat, but they seemed to offer a lot in the way of typical bar food. Maybe they have super delicious food, maybe not. I'll never know. 

There would have been a second half to this review. There would have been a follow-up where I found the place interesting enough to go back when I could sample the food, too, because I did find the place interesting enough to warrant that second visit. That's what I was planning to do as I sipped my beer. 

But there isn't going to be a second half to this review. 

It all came down to watching a skinny dude in a cap come in from out front -- obviously smoking cigarettes -- and proceed to gather ingredients and utensils and then actually make what looked like a big jug of tartar sauce, or something, and then prepping other items, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.!! 
This is inexcusable. 
Skinny cap dude was not the cook at the time, a young lady was at the grill, but he was doing prep work in the back.  The trouble seemed like only him, so I resist my temptation to hard-nose and give only 1 star, and give them 2 instead.

I had so completely planned to go back and try out what seemed like it was going to be some good bar & grill grub, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if I were to run out of other places to check out I'll try it again, but not if skinny cap dude is anywhere in my sight. 

For me Stacker's has fallen before even getting a chance, like a barely played out game of Jenga ruined by a clumsy player.Bummer of a hotel.  Definitely not up to par with the Crowne Plaza name, and previous locations I've haunted.
This place is OLD.  It used to be a Holiday Inn Holidome in the 80's.  They've remodeled the "dome", turning it into a gathering area with an indoor pool in the middle.  
The first room I received faced the pool, and it was OK, but it smelled like a giant fart.  For some reason, I had no cell phone signal whatsoever.  The "high-speed" internet in this hotel is slower than dial-up, and disconnects regularly.  It's not wireless, so you have to use the 14" cord they bring to your room, limiting your computing area to the desk in the room.  
I asked to be moved to an outside-facing room, as I learned that when I walked out to the parking lot, my cell phone signal magically re-appeared.  My new room had two double beds, rather than the king I had, but it smelled fart-free, and my phone worked great.  I was much happier, save for the horrible internet.  It's complimentary, so I got what I paid for.
The business center had a broken laser printer, and I needed to print some documents in a hurry, so they logged me into the concierge / bell desk computer, which had an inkjet printer from 1986.  It printed 10 of the most horrible documents I've ever witnessed.  
The gentleman who checked me in helped me with the printer as well, and was very accommodating (no pun intended) during my stay.  
By the way, if you don't like the smell of chlorine, avoid this place, as the indoor pool in the middle of the hotel makes the entire place reek of it.
I had dinner and a couple of drinks in the bar one night, and it was quite good, too.  However, I don't think I could bring myself to stay here again.10pm on a Friday night.  Wanted a hassle free french dip sandwich.  Tried Subway substitute steak sandwich.  Horrible.  How can they call it meat let alone steak?Great food, terrible service - I recommend it only if your eating TO GO.You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .

As soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .

Next came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !

Soon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .

My husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce . 

Nobody checked on us .

When the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn'tI came across this place craving wings, as I walk in I see a cashier with a what do you want face. She did not greeted us. I look at the menu (on the wall)to see what can I have I ask cashier what she recommendes she carelessly with a smirk on her  face say I dont know....wtf... you work here and you dont know what is good what kind of service is that. I totally ignore her ok its 6 of  us at home just give me a  mini bucket of suicide wings.  The flavor on wings were ok, good flavor thats why I give a one  star cause if it to customer service ill give no star. They seriously need to get rid of her.The ONLY reason this awful place is getting two stars instead of one is because Dr. Oland is one of the most fantastic doctors I've ever had. However, the front office staff and the nurses are beyond horrible. I already had several negative visits due to their poor attitude and making me feel like I was an inconvenience to them by showing up for my appointment but the doc always made up for it. But now I've had their nurses try to inject me with the WRONG medication TWICE and both times I had to reschedule because my medication wasn't ordered ahead of time. No doctor is worth two mistakes with possible drastic consequences like that. The two instances were three months apart so it makes me wonder how many women were improperly injected in between without even knowing it. If Dr. Oland changes offices I'll be happy to give the new place a try. Go somewhere else ladies!All the 5 star reviews are very odd to me. 
Stopped in for lunch and got a lunch special.  Service was fast but poor.  Guy didn't even look at me when he took my order or put my drink down.  
More importantly, the food sucked. If this is "the best Chinese on the West Side" I am glad I live in Gilbert. The fried rice was terrible. Not really fried rice, just seasoned rice.  I got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg.  The egg roll was over sized, mealy and mostly cabbage.  I ordered the green onion beef and got the broccoli beef.  The beef was overcooked and chewy.  It came out fast so I bet it's on a warming table in back and seemed like it may have been there too long.  
They get 2 stars for the huge portions.  So if you are really hungry and have lost your sense of taste in an industrial accident try it out.Not bad, but not great.  Service was really friendly, and prompt.  Food was "meh", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.While I was initially pleased with the price and the cleanliness and the kitchenette, I simply have to give this place low rating simply because of the inconsiderateness of the company. All was well until 6:30 AM when the landscaping crew came through. Yes, leaf blowers and mowers came through at 6:30 AM. I called the front desk to complain and, while polite, they basically said that getting landscaping done before the heat of the day starts is more important than me sleeping. So, unless you want to be woken up by a landscaping crew at 6:30 AM, then stay somewhere else.Nothing to write home about, but I'll write it on Yelp.

I figured that I'd be able to get a better dinner at the mexican restaurant across the street from my hotel than at the hotel. Given that good mexican food is hard to come by in Washington state, I figured that I could get good mexican food anywhere in Arizona.

The service was friendly and the food wasn't very expensive.  But it wasn't all that good either. My carnitas were very dry, like they'd been prepared earlier in the day. I was hoping for something that was moister.

I don't think I'd eat dinner here again, but since my hotel has pretty poor breakfasts, I might give them a second try because I'm a sucker for chorizo.I took my order to go and was extremely dissatified with the quality. I ordered the chicken alfredo for my anniversary and when I got home to check it, the noodles were very dry and had a very minute amount of alfredo sauce. Also, the noodles were halfway over cooked. Next time I would definately check my food before leaving and ask for extra sauce. Brooklyn Boys' alfredo blows this place out of the water!Pizza is ok, sauce is kinda bland,  but these wings are not good.  Wings have the taste of old or burnt oilI just moved to the area and had high hopes for this place. I ordered carne adada tacos and cheese enchiladas. The tacos were ok, but there was nothing special about them, and definitely not worth the price. The enchiladas were the real disappointment. The cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought. It is sad to say that I have had better enchiladas from the frozen food aisle.Its 2:45 am, after having a few drinks with friends needed to get something in the stomach and decided to stop at Waffle House. This fills the void of limited eating options late night /early morning and most of the patrons here at this hour have the same need. Basic service, cookie cutter drab atmosphere with florescent lighting, and basic food but definitely fills a late night niche.The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.Okay, It's a Sears.  This location is about as exciting as the rest of Metro Center has become over the years.  Pretty sad, really.  About a small step up from the Desert Sky Mall location, this Sears is where I go to pick up my online purchases so I don't have to pay shipping. 

 Downside?  Um, I picked up an order today and I received 4 pair of pants WITH NO bag!!!!  Just handed me four pairs of jeans and buh bye.  It's really odd.  You walk in and have to either scan your receipt or slide the credit card through the slider that you placed the order with.  Then it tells you to have a seat and then a person brings your order out.  I'm kinda surprised at that point that your order doesn't just shoot out from a hole in the wall!

The entire store is like a mausoleum with hardly any employees around.  I like getting my daughter's jeans here but other than that?  What do I like?  Not so much.  I guess it's good for appliances.  Yeah.  appliances.Tweakers and crackheads rule this area. Anything within a 5 block radius of 27th Ave and Northern is pretty much a sanctuary area for criminal activity. The store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night. PD doesn't seem to care about the drugs, panhandling and prostitutes in this area. Zombies approach and panhandle for money. Bring your pepper spray as some get a little aggressive and will only back off with a good hosing.Let me start with, I love Souper Salad, being going to them for at least 16 yrs... the problem I have it's with this location by Metro Mall... seriously dirty, the floors, the tables...the booth, nasty.  I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I just can't do this place ever again.  Either the people there just don't care about cleaness because is still a good price, or they just as nasty.  This Souper Salad needs help bad --- remodeling, cleaning and nice people to work, cause the waitress we got was either not happy to be there or plainly just a b - i - t %&^^ you get my point.I'm surprised there are people on here, who think they're treated rudely and abruptly at the Golden Greek.  What makes you think you're so special?!  EVERYONE here is treated that way!

Food at the Golden Greek is something akin to what hospital patients in Athens would eat.  While some of the food is really good  (like the kebabs), some of it is unbelievably "alien" to what I'm used to:  gyro meat like leather straps; all the Italian dishes insulting to even the rattiest Italian homeless man; and everything  -- and I do mean 'everything' -- served with a side-vegetable dish of chickpeas, carrots and peas in tomato soup sauce  (to be fair, the lemon soup is good as are the baklava, when they have them).  Along with the chickpea-tomato soup veggies you'll get enough rice to send your blood sugar readings into the 500s after dinner.

The service ... well, what can we say about the service:  picture a Greek wedding where the bride and groom already hate each other before the ceremony's ended:  the wait "staff" consists of  a sister-brother-mother team.  The brother doesn't do a whole lot of anything except scowl and mumble and, thankfully, spends most of his time outside ignoring your desperate pleas for more water to drown out the starchy rice stuck in your throat.  The sister CAN be charming ... just like rattlesnakes don't HAVE to bite.  Don't be surprised if your dinner is cooking a second time under the heat lamps while she holds a chit chat with elderly guests, who just flew in from "I have nothing better to do with my life than talk endlessly" Land.  But the real workhorse in that place is Mom, a stocky, incredibly muscularly built woman with calves every man at the gym would die for, who cooks, cleans, and is the only one with a sense of humor ... she especially loves to laugh when you complain or drop something on the floor.  And speaking of dropping something on the floor, DO enjoy the many screams and crashing plates you'll hear in the back of the restaurant from the three of them while you're trying to enjoy the bland food:  think of it as ethnic entertainment straight from the Greek version of "Married With Children".

All in all reasonably decent food, but the yelling and attitude have more spice than the mousaka.Disappointing.  Ordered the crab boil.  Way over cooked.  Bland.  No flavor.  Blah.What happened to this place?  I know it's been years since I've been here, but last I remember Sizzler was pretty much on par with Black Angus or close to it.  I know Sizzlers in California that are pretty decent.  This place.. wow. 

My aunt and I had dinner here a few weeks ago.  When I first walked in, I was hit with that bathroom smell.  Mind you the bathrooms are right next to where you order.  Not a good placement. We opted for the salad bar and that's when I looked over at their "buffet" and it looked like nobody had cleaned it for half a day.  The food looked old, the lettuce wilted, it just looked gross.  After getting a few wings (plain because their buffalo sauce looked nasty), we sat down.   I had ordered a diet pepsi and a basket of bread.  The bread wasnt too bad. 

Oh another note on the smells.. when we were walking from our table to the salad bar, it smelled like someone just urinated right on the carpet.   I said out loud "why does it smell like piss in here?"  Yes, hoping someone would hear me.  Nobody cared.

The service was ok and that's why it has 2 stars instead of 1.  Honestly, Sizzler looks like it's nearing the end of its run in Arizona.  There are three left and I believe this is the worst of them. 

Some advice..  Fix this place up or do what Swensen's did and close the doors.Yeah.  I am pretty much appalled at this store.  The only reasons to shop here are the selection and prices.

The turn-offs include:
Jerky employees - hard to put my finger on why this store attracts a weird breed of techno-jerk.
Head scratching security annoyances such as needing to always get a supervisor to determine if your cash is authentic.
The stupid long lane of cashiers and having to wait to be told which counter to go to...

Clearly the prices rock - so if you know exactly what you need and are pretty sure you will never need to go back for support, then it is worth a stop.  Personally, I prefer buying things from amazon.com to avoid paying the local taxes.  

Shopping at Frys is like brain-damage.  I will pass if I can help it.I went here on Thursday May 1st, 2014. The two girls that were working on this day were sitting at a table with their friends when my sister and I walked in. One of them reluctantly stood up to help us while the other stayed seated. The employee acted like it was such a chore to help us. Instead of letting us browse she followed us every step of the way in an attempt to make us hurry up and order. In summary, the customer service was bad, the ice cream was great.Nothing to see here really.  Not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties.  The menu is huge, so much so that it's convoluted.  They're just trying to do too much.  The service usually blows, cause it's staffed by burned out looking skanks, and I'm being nice here.  On the weekend it packs full of douchebags who are engaged in mortal douchebaggery.  it's the kind of place you could get into a fight in when you're not looking for trouble.  Everyone seems to be posturing around here.  I remember when this place first opened up before it expanded 3 times.  It started as an old dudes sports joint now it's a drink special douche attractant.  

I wouldn't go here unless forced to.  Ohe yeah the drinks aren't cheap here either, unless there's a special.I went here for my friend's birthday last night and the only word I have to describe the experience is... Weird. I think there may have been only 10 girls in the place even though it was pretty busy in the pool table room, so definitely what my understanding of a "sausage fest" is. 

The beer prices were okay, 3.50 for a pretty large mug of either Miller, Bud, or Ultra. I didn't eat, we just drank beer and fought for time on one of the two pool tables. 

Overall, I think it was just not as cool as I was hoping for, and the crowd was a little shadier than I would have liked. The waitress was pretty surly, but I'm a server too and I think I would be just as off-putting if I dealt with that crowd on a daily basis.

I hear the pizza's pretty good so I may return during the day to try it, but I probably won't go again on a Saturday night.Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here.Not So Good.

I really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review.  Especially when the reviews are really good.  So lets start off on a positive note.  The staff New Asian Kitchen are friendly and very accommodating.   The service is fast and the prices are reasonable.

However, The food just wasn't that good. The pork and  chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless. The  vegetables were overcooked and soggy. The egg roll was cooked nicely, but just didn't have a good flavor.  The same could be said about the won tons and crab puffs.   

I cannot  give New Asian Kitchen a good recommendation but in a pinch, you could do worse.Tastes like just bread. Wasn't good at all.The New England Clam Chowder was quite good.  Very rich, small bowl for the money (I think it's priced at $3,95).  But it's the signature dish, I "get it".

The Ipswich Clam roll was mediocre.  What I really didn't care for was the $3 side of cole slaw that could not have been 2 ounces.

So, my meal was $21 without a tip.  Trust me when I tell you I ain't going back for a $21 meal of soft clams, good soup, expensive cole slaw.  I'm sure there are fans of this place, just not meSomebody on Facebook mentioned Taylor's as a good place for seafood on the West side, so I checked out the Yelp reviews.  I think I had realistic expectations going in, sort of a blue hair place, nothing fancy but good bang for the buck.
I ordered a cup of New England clam chowder (it's a chowder house, right?) and the grilled Mahi.  The chowder was okay, a good amount of clams, but it had an odd flavor to me...cheap sherry maybe?  It's basically just potato and clam and I personally like some bacon, celery, etc.
The Mahi was definitely strange, I expect a 'grilled' piece of fish to be simply cooked over some sort of open flame.  It arrived scored on top with no visible grill marks.  It also had a sort of teriyaki sauce on top that, frankly, ruined the fish-it was hideous.Have been to this rally's multiple times and it just gets worse each time. The food is always delicious but the service is terrible. Always takes way too long even if you're the only one there. The employees are always rude and could care less about your order. The condition of the building and parking lot is horrible. Be warned there is a giant pothole as you enter the drive thru!!i guess i'm the only person that didn't enjoy this museum but i guess my standards are a bit higher. if you came with kids, the gold panning would probably be fun but seeing as i truly enjoy natural history, i found 99% of the museum to be less than educational. "dinosuar mountain" seemed cheap, as did the animatronics that went with it. the jail and gold panning section seemed meh. i do think it would be great for kids and it's a decent price, but i'll skip it next time..I'm so disappointed in this place. The mechanics do good work, but the service writers are a mess. 

My last three visits have all taken 3-4 times longer than quoted because of parts order screw ups.  They even sent me home once after 4 hours because they couldn't finish an oil change, air and fuel filter swap in one visit. That's the easy stuff, guys. 

Today the service writers joked with me about always making me wait, while two mechanics hung around the lobby because they couldn't move forward on half-done jobs. When my car is filling a bay, that means the poor schlump scheduled for the next timeslot isn't getting out of there any time soon. 

I know this location was worried that the train construction was going to kill their business. They should be more worried about their reputation. A new VW mechanic opened up nearby, so don't expect me to be back to Network. Who has the time?


Note on the response from the business: Yeah, I know. That's why I always call a day or two in advance to ask you guys to have the filters. Your organizational issues aren't my fault, and I'm disappointed that I'd be blamed. Sorta makes my point.An hour and a half to serve four people mediocre food? I think not. The mole sauce was delicious, but just putting chicken wings to swim in it on your plate does not make it suitable. The chimis were less than good, with absolutely NO seasonings for the meat. It should have been delicious, but honestly it was a let down. The food was mediocre (if not lacking) and the service was awful. Service was slow to pick up after people left, never asked if we wanted refills (after an hour and a half! really?) and honestly needed work. Along with all of the food. Only a few chips and out of the bottle salsa for starters? No thanks. 

Next time, I'll just drive all the way to Phoenix for some Mi Patio! Honestly, the only thing worth the money is the menudo. I won't be going back here again.One of the dumpier Fry's stores in town. Goes a little further down hill as time gies by.I have been a loyal customer since 1999. Makes me sad to right a bad review but since high schools closed their campuses Steves place has deteriorated tremendously. I went in as usual for lunch ordered my sub and returned to work with the wrong sandwich. I ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items. I called spoke with a nice man who said come in I will write ur name down. I did and 4 people playing around in the back told me I need to speak with owner which I said no problem and their response was he is out of town. They all thought it was funny and I was so upset. If Steve's crazy sub ever goes out of business it will be because of the horrible customer service from his teenage and one grown man who seem to not care if customers ever comeback. Steve please read this and several others I have read that your staff needs to go. I hope someday I will be treated as a customer and maybe even get the sub I paid for.Rosa's--Just okay.

The opening chips and salsa was tasty and bottomless, but the salsa was definitely on the sweet side.  The food overall wasn't that bad, but nothing distinctive.  You get a fairly large plate of Mexifood in a pleasant atmosphere and pretty good service, but the taste is only average.  Frankly, there are a LOT of Taquerias, even Filiberto's at times, that have had better tasting grub than this, especially at the prices that they charge.  They don't charge an excessive amount, but dinner for three here cost over $60 with tip.  The taste of the food wasn't commensurate with the price--just to compare, another meal at the Filiberto's drive-thru in Tempe provided a similar amount of food with a better taste for $25.

Worth the 35 extra dollars to eat in?  No.
Recommended?  No.
Crappy?  No, but why not get food you really enjoy for less money elsewhere?I've visited several times for both breakfast and lunch.  They strive to have a homey feel, but the fake wood floors just make the place overly noisey.  The staff is very nice.  The food always reminds me of what I make myself when I'm in a hurry, rushing out the door.  Overall, I don't enjoy the place very much.Love the store they have very competitive prices on their organic products ( except for their apples!) They do need to try and expand their organic produce more(even though they've come a long way). I really think I would give them a 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for their employees! They have Some of the rudest people I've ever come across working at check out.$109 bill. I hate it when I feel like I could have had a better meal in my own kitchen. Why would you serve me brown sugar that is so lumpy and hard as a rock? 

It wasn't even sticky or the rich brown color nor did it smell like brown sugar should smell. It's obvious it was stale. Why would you even bring that out to me? 

The 6oz filet was so thin and had no texture to it at all. I eat filet mignon ALOT, and in the price point that Outback is selling it for, it is outrageous that it tasted like it did. I had to ask for A1!!! IF A CUSTOMER HAS TO USE A1 to choke down a $20 steak in your restaurant, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ARRESTED!!!  

The waiter was pleasant. The sweet potato was good, even without brown sugar.  But I can make a sweet potato at home for 1.00. 

I didn't like this visit at all, and for me to give it another shot, it would have to be FREE!  

I would rather go Mastro's and spend an extra $15 for an 8oz filet and feel like I died and went to heaven. People who eat here are selling their taste buds AND their self respect short.So we visited this establishment on a nice a lonely night during Christmas break. I did my research on my beloved yelp and should have erred on the side of caution and "followed my guts" instinct.  Upon entry I realized this was going to suck...The lounging around nonchalant hostesses slowly took us to a seat, but it wasn't like rocket science, as there was only one other customer and his lady friend chomping on some food. We ordered our soda drinks which came in some real thin cup type things loaded with ice. Did they not have a fountain machine on site??? Not sure. Moreover, it came time to order.....we ordered our dishes and an app. Let me say that the Kung Pao that I ordered was the worse tasting dish I have ever had at any Chinese food place. Cutting corners aren't ya....With about 3 sticks of chopped celery. And a bunch of peanuts....not even real brown sauce. The app we got sucked as well. I felt like walking out after it appeared as though something suspicious was going on when the hippy looking cook came out to chill with the girls....dude this is not an authentic Chinese food place.  I understand that I am in east Mesa...but for real, panda express serves it much better than this place. I WISH I could get refunded the absurd amount of close to 40 bucks I spent on a family of three......for such little food and such a bunk tasting meal. Heck....I can rock the wok much better. We will never return and I will not have a menu for delivery in my humble home. Anyways caveat emptor....yuck...............This is strictly a review of the food. The service was good but the food could have been much better. I won't compare it or say I should have gone to XYZ, but its nothing to write home about in my opinion. Better options out there.I wanted to like this place. The service was great, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was wonderfully kitschy. There was one problem: the food. It was bland and just gross. Don't mean to be a troll, just being honest. Still had fun. The accordion player was a nice touch, on the bright side.Why I even bothered to return to this mess hall for breakfast is beyond me.  First of all, I take back about what I said about their breakfast.  I ordered the country breakfast, two eggs, two sausages, 2 pieces of bacon and two pancakes.  The pancakes were horrid, they were so hard you can play baseball with them.  Needless to say, the help has turned into an I don't know what.  One of the waitresses apparently just gave birth, good, I am happy for her.  So the owner is waiting on tables.  Without warning, she approaches our table all giggly and laughing, "Sara just had her baby."  Then she goes from table to table, "Sara just had her baby, it's a girl, c-section."  Oh please.  First of all, I did not ask about a baby or someone's pregnancy or child birth.  I came to your diner to eat not to hear about some woman's labor and delivery experience.  Diner beware, the owner is nuts.  Most people do not want to hear about childbirth over a meal.I have used these guys for years and the wash jobs are usually pretty decent.  I have also gotten my car waxed there 3 time.  The first two times they did a pretty good job and charged me 59 bucks.  This time they charged me 79 bucks and the quality of the job was very poor, they did the job by hand, not polisher and even missed portions of the car.

I contacted them on their web site and either they do not pay attention to the website or they do not want to face their customers, because they never contacted me back.  Besides why should they care, they already got my money!

I will continue to get the car washed there, but will never again allow them to rip me off for the over priced wax job.Went here with the girlfriend's grandparents last week and I must say I expected better after all the hype I got. Of course some of the hype was actually incorrect (THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY SERVE ND POTATOES) so they get cut a little slack for that. The service is fast and friendly, the bakery has some tasty stuff in it, and if you ever want to buy a cow's heart this is the place to do it (don't know why you would though). 

As far as the food, that's where I was underwhelmed. The mashed potatoes were like water, the veggies were cold, and the steak was just alright. I asked for my steak rare and I got medium well. Not being an ass I decided not to send it back and the steak itself wasn't bad. Just not too memorable....

Combined with the facts that the parking sucks and it sounds like an airport terminal inside I don't think I will be back. Unless maybe if I ever find a need for a whole cow's heartI am a general contractor and have had dealings with many tile/flooring companies in San Diego and the metro Phx area.  I went to Imperial after hearing an ad on the radio.  I wanted tile for a bathroom I am remodeling in my own home.  After 2 visits I landed on a 12x24 silver vein cut travertine.  I was told it was in CA (no surprise all tile comes from the Long Beach ports).  I was told more than once thatthey get 2-3 trucks a week from CA and that I would have my tile in 2 maybe 3 days.  Well, I am on day 13 now.  Multiple calls from me, none from them.  I have heard some lame excuses so far and was told Weds it would be finally be here Fri, then Fri that they needed to log it in Sat and now Sat that it was not on the truck.  Well, just refund my 100% payment already and I will go somewhere else.  Thanks for a wasted 2 weeks.We had high hopes for this place as the hours are so abnormally awesome for Mesa. We are new to this area and we have found it odd that nearly everything closes at 8PM most nights.  We were happily surprised to read that this place was open most of the night.  So we planned a family outing and went to check it out.

We were looking forward to trying the Cronuts and maybe an iced coffee.  We stopped in and found only one young man working the counter.  Unfortunately we quickly saw he had an attitude as if we were disturbing whatever he was doing in the back.

We asked about Cronuts and were told "you see what we have, we are all out".  We asked about iced coffee drinks and if they have those and were told he doesn't have time to make that.

He couldn't even speak well enough to be understandable when we asked about ordering a dozen donuts.  I wasn't sure if they even sold them by the dozen after his response.

So while their service sucked, the donuts looked pretty good.  Aside from one completely stale and hard as a brick cake Donut we had, the others all were quite tasty.

It's a shame their service turned us off of this place as we live in Mesa and would love to make this a frequent place to stop for a late night sugar high.Good place to go when visiting your grandparents from the midwest.  grandma and grandpa will love it because the waitress knows exactly how grandpa likes his oatmeal!  You'll tolerate it because you see the waitress being nice to your grandparents.  Cinnamon rolls were pretty good!This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.

Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)

First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching "the kitchen window movie" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).  

The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. "You two ordered omeletes right?" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.

We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The "homemade" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.  

I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.

Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross.I Had The Linguini RWB Shrimp and Mushroom. The Shrimp and Mushroom where good the Linguini had No flavor at all there was no sauce at all I guess It was my fault for not reading the whole thing I just assumed that it would have some kind of sauce but It's ok this was the Second Time I been here first time I was disappointed too I had the "No Bones Buffalo Chicken Breast"  and to be honest if it didn't cost 10 bucks I wouldn't ate as much at I did and I still didn't eat it all. My friends said the pizza was good, I had a slice I wasn't impressed.. But to say something nice and the reason I gave it two stars not one was the service was not and the atmosphere was nice too.came here because the rv park owner told us it was THE BEST
Perhaps our problem was we came for lunch. Very disappointing in the quality and flavor of the food.The previous review had it right by not ordering anything. Both of my stars are for the scenery and the location - nothing for the food at all.

We were here for a Easter lunch today as we wanted to go someplace out of the way and peaceful on a beautiful Easter Sunday. The restaurant is on a beautiful location in the Saguaro Lake Marina, with a great view of the lake (and the aforementioned retaining wall). 

The location definitely deserves a better eatery. Our hostess was not very pleasant and seemed uninterested in our business or our reservation. The server was virtually nonexistent and also did not seem to care about the tables. We opted to sit on the patio so we could see the lake and it was a beautiful day.  A lot of the tables reminded me of a McDonald's table - molded plastic with fixed swivel chairs.

The menu SOUNDS a lot better than it actually is - and we found out why from a conversation overheard with a server and customer at another table: The food for the restaurant is all purchased at Costco. That's right, Costco. That explains the uninspired Gyro with precut strips of meat, "Greek" salad consisting of what appeared to be bagged salad with cubed feta, olives and thick italian dressing. Another selection that sounded good until the plate arrived is the Malibu Chicken sandwich: Your standard Tyson chicken breast on a roll with a slice of Oscar Mayer ham and some rubberish cheese.

Please let someone renovate this place - it could be a real gem with a good menu, solid food sourcing and a staff that cares more.The food is OK but not anything to get excited about. I've tried it a few times over the past several years hoping it would impress me, it never does. There are other places I'd rather go that have more creative dishes, and more flavor. I'll eat there if others want to go but I don't go there otherwise.Food wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here.They finally have replaced the lit up sign outside that fell down in about August 2007 which still hadn't been replaced when I was here in August 2008.  I stopped in to check out their garden department but the store was being seriously renovated and rearranged so it was hard to find anything.  After I walked about two miles looking at everything I paid for my purchases and left
(4/19/09)This Walmart is a hellhole, even for a Walmart (and I remember when it was nice and new and Walmart was a place you could buy things made in America!). 

They hilariously spared every expense in converting it to a SuperCenter, so you can walk around the store and tell where they just bolted more, new store onto the existing, run-down store. It's great.

And it still smells weird. Less like pee than it used to, but still not good.This store does not have a large selection of items. Many are decent in quality. Would not even make an offer on a 14k white gold ring with a half carat diamond and 2/3 ctw in natural untreated blue sapphires. At least they were willing to look and were not rude about it.My family really likes this place for breakfast and we came here while I was visiting for the holiday. Taking into consideration I eat out much more than they do, I am writing this review from my perspective as a passionate foodie. Overall I give Hoosiers 2 stars.

The main thing for me when I dine out is the food. I know a lot of people are into the ambiance and service is a factor in the equation. To me I could care less of the environment and will tolerate long line lines and rude employees if the food rocks. At Hoosiers, I found none of the above. 

I ordered Corned beef hash and eggs and my brother in law ordered Ham Steak and eggs. I usually choose eggs Benedict or corn beef hash as a means to judge a breakfast joint. I should have asked the waitress if they made their hash from scratch or from a can. When my food arrived, I quickly found out. The hash looked a lot like Alpo and tasted like what I would expect it to. Not much flavor and no texture or substance. It was mixed with a lot of home fried potato's, a trick a lot of restaurants use to make up for the tasteless flavor you would expect from something dumped from a can.

The eggs were cooked over easy and the potato's were cooked well and tasted pretty good. I think it's sad when the best aspect of a breakfast is the toast! My dining partner thought his food was good and the portions they give are fairly generous. The coffee was average and the refills were not given in a timely manner. 

Overall the service was just average. My family are regulars here and seemed to have a good rapport with the staff. Like I said earlier, refills on coffee were not that timely and no one came to followup once we got our food. When I went to pay the bill, the girl at the register had issues with the receipt printer running out of paper. She almost double charged me because she could print my receipt and told me "I don't think the charge went through" and asked for my ATM card again. I asked her to make sure before I haded it over. She got some assistance from the manager and I was right, the charge did go through the first time. While trying to straighten this out the line of diners waiting for tables got quite long. No one else offered to start seating customers even thought some guy who I assumed to be a manager (he was walking around while I was there, greeting customers like they do at Walmart, but not really helping anyone).

This place is located in a strip mall and has plenty of parking available. The inside has some Hoosiers paraphernalia, but seemed to be pretty average. Decent number of tables, but no outdoor seating. The cash register is located right next to the entrance, which creates a "traffic jam" for customers paying their bills and those who are waiting to be seated. There is no where inside for people to sit while waiting for a table. Customers have to leave their names and then go stand outside and wait to be called.

Chandler and Gilbert have several places for breakfast that rock all over this place. Taking this into consideration, I would not eat at this place again. The food was average at best (corned beef was awful) and the service left something to be desired. It was a holiday period, but I still expect decent service and this place was not that busy when I dined here. Don't waste you time and money with this place. I recommend the Farmhouse Restaurant and Liberty Market. To be honest, the breakfast I had at IHOP on Thanksgiving day was way better than this joint and they were packed and it was on a holiday!Here today to wash rugs.  9:30AM Sunday.  I have used this laundry for the last time.  In past, I have used the jumbo washers for my home throw rugs and for large bedding--comforters etc.  No one was staffed today, the machines to buy laundry detergent --none one of the 4 slots worked.  Chairs are grossly filthy (and I am not exaggerating--I am going to upload the pictures)--and broken.  They have never been cleaned--and they are supposed to be white.  This place is not clean and no one cares apparently.  Last time.  For pricing I'll share:  $5 for jumbo washers, the largest.  They do a good job, and today they seemed to be all working.  Bigger dryers, 25-cents for 5 min (75-cents for 15-min--which is not quite enough for rugs on medium heat)Gosh, where do I start.... went for breakfast yesterday and was excited to try Brunchies as I had been hearing about it for years. I love Serrano's so I figured that this place was going to be good as well. Not even close to being like Serrano's. First off, you can definitely tell that Brunchies takes a back seat to Serrano's in the owners eyes. My first impression was not a good one based on the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant and the service from the hostess. We came in the back entrance and walked to the front. The hostess was not very polite or friendly and seemed a bit slow. I know that sounds mean but she acted like she really was not excited to be there. I get it, a hostess job is not exactly exciting, however, she could have at least acted somewhat happy to seat us. In any event, the booth she sat us at was filthy. The table was clean but the seating had crap all over it and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in god knows how long. It especially grossed me out when I went to wipe the seat with my hand so I could scoot over and some of the gunk from the seat stuck to my hand. Eeeewwwwwweeeeeee. Not only that, the cups were dirty and old. In fact, I know for a fact that they are the old cups from Serrano's. How do I know? Because I have eaten at Serrano's for a long time and I actually commented on how Serrano's needed new cups on one of their comment cards. A week later, new cups at Serrano's which was great but now I know where the old ones went!
Anyways, on to the menu. It was your typical greasy spoon diner breakfasts. Sometimes I don't mind that but I have really been trying to watch what I eat lately so was hoping to get something with egg whites in it. It didn't appear that was even an option on the menu. In fact, there wasn't a whole lot of anything healthy on their menu. I opted for the veggie omelet on their special menu with home fries and wheat toast. The hubby had their special of the day which was chicken fried steak with gravy, eggs, and a biscuit. The portions were definitely large which also warranted the prices (the prices were good too). So this was a definite value for breakfast, however, the food was very mediocre. Both my husbands and my eggs were not seasoned whatsoever. On the plus side, the hubby said that the biscuit definitely tasted home made.
A few other notes, I was especially disgusted when I saw one of the waiters (not ours thank god) picking his nose as he walked into the kitchen. Yuck. Lastly, the big creepy statue of the old man with a tray of candy needs to go. Halloween is over and wont be happening for awhile. Needless to say, this place a big let down and I am not very thrilled to go back again. However, I most likely will have to go one more time because the hubby wants to try the hobo omelet.   :(We like our brunches, however this restaurant was maybe average at best. We arrived at 11 a.m.so it wasn't that busy and we were seated immediately. 

We were also waited on quickly, however I had to ask for water three times. Our potato orders were cold. Rest of food was mediocre. Waiters were running around quickly and appearing busy, but they didn't seem to know what to do. 

While our experience was OK, I don't think we will be eating here again.LT was awesome yet Dwayne his father in law who answers the phone could take of few classes in phone ettiquette.....really had bad impression from first contact just from how rude he was on phone....if my home warranty hadn't set up an arrangement I would of never used them, but the actual service with LT was the opposite experienceI've heard when better waitresses are there, service is better, but if you go on the night she isn't there, service sucks.How about some meat with your cilantro stem tacos? jaysus, the green herb is seriously inexpensive; just the leaves will do.

In a 5 tiered rating system, and with hundreds of Mexican food choices in the valley, the stars begin to get blurry. The trouble is, certain dishes at Elmer's are just okay compared to others.

Rice? Great. Beans? Like El Sol down the street, several whole beans strewn about the refried puree for posterity; no thank you.
Tacos al pastor? Pass. Gristly pork and cardboard corn tortillas.

See my list for Mexican food recommendations.Who knew you could get kicked out of this MCD by an non-employee! Better watch your step here or the guy who sits by the counter will get you! Hehe. Just better buy something! Can't even use my wifi here in peace! I like the Mcd on Val Vista and Guadalupe better at least the manager there is courteous and polite to everyone.
no privacy here either. Really, the management needs to let the employees do the table cleaning!They get off easy and hardly do anything! wow, what a shame!

Well, thats all I have to say! Oh wait one more thing, I won't be coming back here again so thet dude can irritate the snot out of me! Oh my goodness, how annoying!

I hope the management and owners read this!Lets start with the good........their wings are really good and  large in size.
Tv's everywhere ........

The bad...... This location has a few antiquated projection screen tv's that make what you're watching look like a 1975 tv. please upgrade !!
Wings are now 1.10 each.....man oh man....when did wings get so crazy expensive??
A dozen wings.... 13.00 ???  15 wings 16.00 ?
They have so many specials that the waiter couldn't even figure them out.....
Special Calendars, drink specials, happy hour only at the bar.......we were frazzled just trying to get past the rules.


Again , loved the asian wings, my jerk chicken sandwich was ok......Every time I've been here it seems they are always out of stock of whatever I need.. except chlorine tablets. This time it was a pool net... com'on - you can't keep your own brand of replacement pools nets in stock? I'm looking at switchin' out our nets now that they never have them in stock.The Summary:
- See my review of the neighboring "Napa AutoCare Center" for more of my horror story.
- Transmission leak diagnosed as needing the leaking transmission cooler replaced.
- A seperate transmission shop said that the issue could have been mistaken for a leaking cooler, but actually was leaking from the transmission vent above the cooler.
- Basically, a misdiagnosis. I never got the transmission fixed so I gave it two stars. They could have been right, but not likely.

The Story:
Brought my 2002 VW Jetta to the neighboring Napa AutoCare Center for engine issues. Was referred here to take a look at a small transmission leak. They diagnosed the leak as needing a new transmission cooler, which would have cost $800. We decided to think on it.

Eventually ended up taking it to "State to State Transmission" on Bell Road in northern Phoenix. They said the issue could have been mistaken for a transmission cooler leak, but was actually "blurping" from the transmission vent just above the cooler lines. The guy at "State to State" said they could have been trying to replace the cooler then hitting you with a transmission rebuild, which it actually ended up needing, or they were just incompetent.The place was at quarter capacity. I sat at a booth between other customers and waited while a guy cleaned and set a vacant table. I saw the waitress come out of the kitchen and visit a table. She came out one other time and visited same table. Was she also the cook? I don't know how else to explain her absence. It was probably a good five but it felt like every bit of ten minutes before I left, never to be acknowledged. None of the other four peopled tables were visited in this time, just the one that the waitress visited.We waited about 45 minutes for table, not including calling ahead 10 minutes before arriving.   After waiting so long I was really excited to eat, unfortunately the food was really nothing special. I would recommend staying away from the crab benedict which tasted fishy and obviously came from a can. The strawberry pancakes were good and overall the portions were very big. The service was ok but nothing great. Our waitress maybe smiled once which is cool, but don't act all put out when I remind you about that side of bacon you forgot. 

I'm completely baffled as to why anyone would wait for 45 minutes for The Breakfast Club. I don't think we'll be heading back.Very disappointing. Hardly any wait, and now I know why. We went a couple years ago when it first opened and had great food, but it has really gone downhill.

THE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.

The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.

Belgian waffle. Decent. It's kind of hard to screw up a waffle. 

SERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.

It is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.

We won't be back.I wanted to like it, i really did.. i even waiting 45 minutes in the cold hoping for a great experience.  What we have here is a typical Scottsdale joint, trendy and hip(ster).  The eggs benedict was ok, but eclipsed by even Village Inn's version, they did have decent coffee though, and once seated in our cramped booth, the service was great.Overrated. Very busy, always a wait to get in. Patio is loud. Food is meh. No soda. Kind of pricey too.Horrible service!!!! If you do not have your party there then they do not seat anyone!! The are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great. Food is fine if you can get past the service :/I just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago.  I miss the scones, cookies, & breads from the Great Harvest Company in Evanston, IL.....so, I search for a "similar" bakery in Scottsdale through Yelp.  Scone is so small (the size of my palm and it's quite "flat" and the icing is way too sweet.  My daughter's sugar cookies are also very sweet.  Honestly, not as good as we thought for the $6 we've spent.  O boy, it makes me miss the Great Harvest Company even more.Prior experience:

I've been here 3 times in the past year and a half.  The other 2 times were pleasant, there was a man working and we chatted for a few minutes, he seemed to be the/an owner.  An erudite East-Coaster, helpful, passionate about books and about suggesting and finding what I needed in the stacks.

Current experience:

So today I head over on my way home and I pulled in delighted to see that i have about 38 minutes before they close.  I spend a minute reading the notice on the door--they're moving and I'm disappointed as I live in South Scottsdale and vacant buildings are the new concept in architecture.  I digress.

I pull open the door, breathe in the trusty used bookstore scent that I love, delighted with my day as well as just about my whole damn world...  Then it begins, the screeching.  There's what appears to be a streetkid® (if we were in berkeley) slouched behind the register, I wince as she screams in my general direction, YOU HAVE THIRTY MINUTES!  

Okay, I've worked enough retail to know that late shoppers are a PAIN in the ass, they screw up your ability to close the registers early and getting out on time, etc.  Still.  what about a 'hey' or a 'hi' or a 'just to let you know'.  Seriously, I'm not asking for a HJ, just dish me out something polite *in addition*, if your particular brand of customer service is admonishing the would-be buyer. 

I then made the mistake of going directly to her for help with jogging my memory about a book of short stories that I was interested in....  I had a partial name and was certain she'd finish my sentence with indy bookstore girl smugness, which was cool, I braced myself.  Alas.  no!  She further leaned into the computer and came up with 'no, nothing'.  To be clear, she either meant that *they* didn't have it or that it didn't exist at all, Flannery O'Connor.  I persisted, 'no...?  nothing?'  She didn't  seem invested in searching further so I asked where the 'literature' section might be and she extended her long and pale arm scarred from self-abuse and pointed in some direction that was behind me but could have also been out the window and beyond the parking lot.  So far we have LOUD, rude and indifferent

As I'm perusing I see a youngish guy come in and go up to her and ask about an author, I listened to see if she offered better service, and she did... She actually peeled herself from behind the desk and personally walked him to where he would find the author.  Though I am pretty sure she told the guy that Bukowski is going to be coming out with something new later this year.  (ha!)  

The guy and her talk about how hard it is to find such an obscure writer at the library. (ha!)  In addition, 'customers who come in with lists of books' and expect her to search for them.  (what!  that sounds book-fun, to me!) I was going to interject on both counts but was feeling pretty 'f*ck it' by this point and I heard the door open and close and it was quiet again for a few moments.  

Then, girl-clerk screamed again, "YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES!"

To be clear, I'm standing not 10 feet from her...I consider picking up a copy of 'The Heart is a Lonely Hunter' but it's too new/doesn't have the old cover.

Then, "YOU HAVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES!"

I decide that I am not going to buy a thing even if I find the most perfect book, ever.  

Back in my car, the clock on my dash says that I still have 15 minutes.  I think about what a total assault this woman is on all of the senses and I consider calling the owner, and I still might.

Edit to add:  I will still shop here, I'll just be better prepared and not expect the same kind of help that I once received.food was nothing to complain about but does mexican food have to cost more than $5?  if you enjoy paying $10-15 per person for beans, rice and tortillas, then you've found the right place.  

we ate there at night and they seated us in a few adjacent booths where lights were burned out and we could hardly see who was sitting next to us.

we left a tip and some extra for the light bulbs.Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, "Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah"  When he should have said, "Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard."

I'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.

I can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's.Three words: Too Many Colors. 

I was taken aback by the fifties-diner-esque magenta, sky blue and black tiles and neon lights all over the walls. My eyes were entirely too dazzled to comprehend that this is supposed to be a Mexi joint. 
We ordered a taco/enchilada combo plate and the chicken fajitas with a couple of margaritas. The food was nothing to write home about. American-style mexican food, slightly less flavorful than El Torito. The margaritas (well tequila of course, with extra ice), were not too watered down and had decent flavor and gave me enough of a buzz to run across the street on the way home into oncoming traffic to get "something sweeeet!!" at CVS.I really despise the new BR concept store here.

I used to go to the Fashion Square BR all the time when I lived in Phoenix and I generally liked it.  I've been to this new store 4 times now when I've been back in town, and I just can't figure out how this was supposed to be an improvement.  The store layout is horrible -- with everything in tiny rooms I tend to just glance into a room, not see anything I like, and move on to the next room.  If I do see something I like, I then have to dig in 12 different places to find my size because they scatter the same product in numerous areas in the same tiny room.  

The employees seem especially foul here -- they brush right past you on their way through the store without even looking at you.  The "mandatory greeter" they make stand at the front of the store serves no purpose other than (1) to make me feel awkward when I want to look at the product in the front and (2) serve as the social gathering spot for other employees while they ignore me digging through stacks of pants looking for my size.

Given that this is a new wing of the mall and they likely had some say in what kind of space they ended up in, I just can't fathom why they chose this awkward layout.Orange Table has a great ambiance and location. The menu is interesting and well thought out.

That being said, I have no plans on coming back. 

I've been coming here off and on for a couple years. Each time gets more and more disappointing. This particular time we arrived at 9:30 or so on a Saturday, just before the big breakfast rush. A good chunk of the tables were occupied, however there were a few available, probably about half full. The two of us gave our name and were seated in the waiting area.  As we sat, we noticed a gentleman, chilling out behind the counter, texting in plain view, generally looking lazy and slow. 

About 10 minutes later, we were seated. Turns out Lazy McTexter was our server. He seats us, doesn't ask us what we would like to drink (we'd been waiting, we knew), and disappears for another 10 minutes. He comes back, I decide against coffee (theirs is delicious usually) and went with OJ. Big mistake. I understand fresh squeezed OJ has pulp, but this was ridiculous. I literally had to chew it. We ordered the food then too, no telling how long before he'd be back.

Food came about 15 minutes after ordering. Not forever, but a little long for a breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs benedict, and my friend ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I know they're famous for the hash, but we've had it before.

Here's the worst part about the whole situation, the food was good! The eggs benedict were some of the best I've had in the valley! The hollandaise was creamy with just a hint of citrus tart. Eggs were poached well, ham was good. 

The pancakes were a little dry however. Not to worry, when you have dry pancakes and don't give a damn about calories, you just put a little extra syrup on it, right? We wave down our server (literally waved my hand in the air to get him), ask for the extra syrup, and he mutters that it will be extra. A little ridiculous to charge extra for a cup of syrup, if you ask me, but whatever, it can't be more than 50 cents right?

Wrongo, pal. $2.00! Two George Washingtons for a shot of maple syrup. Seriously?! I don't care how good it is, syrup ain't $2.00. 

That was the kicker. To have service that terrible (note the other reviews) and then nickel-and-dime the customer like that is unacceptable. I worked in restaurants for the majority of my teens and 20's (everything from prep cook to bartender), and I think I have reasonable expectations when it comes to quality of service. Orange Table doesn't cut it. Adios.Disappointed. New owners and new menu. Food is still good, but the service and ambiance went down hill. We couldn't figure out why there wasn't an hour wait on a Sunday to begin with, then our food was different, and the service was very slow and a little unpleasant. Then my fiancé asked if the place was bought out and they said yes, about three weeks ago. Again, the food was good but you get a lot less of it for the price. :(.OMG!  Can someone show these people how to make stuffed grape leaves?  If I wanted the leaves with a couple pieces of rice in them I'd make them myself.
Small, small appetizers for $8 each.  Not worth the money cause you can get a better deal somewhere else.
Oh, it's Scottsdale you say?  Well, whoop-tie doo, but I still don't get off getting ripped off with small portions with normal prices.
And we sat outside on a very chilly day.  I mean, this place is truly hole in the wall charging Ocean Club prices.  Get real, folks.
The hummus was good, the sandwiches--sans much chicken--was okay, the tabbouleh tasted good for the little bit we got.
Yeah, another Scottsdale place that charges high prices while giving you little in return.
If this is your thing, then go for it.  It just isn't mine.Great atmosphere and food but super slow service, pricey drinks, and sometimes you never receive your hookah. Idk if the new ownership knows how to run a smooth service. I miss the old staff and prompt happy service.

The good things... belly dancers are entertaining; when you do receive a hookah, it's great, the food is very good and fast once you get to order.  It's too bad they can't get the service to be a little better! Could be an amazing spot!Why do people like this place? Why is it always packed?

I came here over the weekend to grab a drink in between rounds of afternoon shopping.
 My friend and I wanted a quick glass of wine (yes, I know, this isn't the place to go for great wine. But I thought we could quickly grab something decent). Let me start off by saying I tried to totally different wines that tasted exactly the same -- sour and rotten. Then we wanted an appetizer. SO I got California Rolls.
Now, I know that's kind of lame, for people who are into sushi. I'm not into sushi. Our waitress actually ROLLED HER EYES when I ordered it. Kona Grill, come off it! You're like the Olive Garden of Sushi, and you're judging ME for ordering California rolls???
Then they weren't even very good. And my stomach was upset for about four hours after I ate it.
And our waitress took about 30 minutes to bring us our check.
And our table was sticky and smelled of beer.
Ick. 
Never coming back.Settled in pretty late at the hotel and this was the only close place opened that was low carbs (somewhat); happens that it was happy hour. I had about 20 minutes left and ordered as much as I can.

The lemon drop, which was recommended by the waitress was horrible. Tasted like 7up.

Potstickers: pan seared chicken, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it

Avocado egg rolls: i love avocado, so can't go wrong with this dish. However, I still think Cheesecake factory is better.

All their sushi rolls were below average, too much rice and not enough stuffing. Keep in mind, the rolls are pretty small. The combination sashimi was okay, the fishes weren't too fresh. 

The California roll: very typical

Crab Crunch and Special roll. Both tasted the same. All I tasted was the artificial crab...

Spicy Tuna Roll: I can see the grading on the tuna was poor.Used to love this place. Over the  years it has declined. Ordered the sea bass  not sure if it was real sea bass and the side was awful, buried in butter.  Too expensive for what you get. . Always have good service though.   Management need to take a gander at the reviews and do something3 stars for the food, 2 for the service. Waitress was in attentive and so absent that we enlisted the busboy to get soy sauce, chopsticks and wine for us! When he brought the entrees out He even fixed our wobbly table - something our waitress again failed to do. Great busboy btw

Miso soup was not what we remembered but sushi and pad Thai were good.Not impressed. My wife and I have been here a few times for happy hour. Today my mini burgers were not seasoned at all. The fry portion was for a child. My wife bit into her pad thai and spit it out immediately. Went to alert management that they were serving inferior product. He could not be bothered. We asked for our money back and will not be visiting again.The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because the beds were very cozy and the food was yummy.  They also kept it clean, but that's kind of a mandatory basic.

The service is really what brings the rating down.  They gave away my suite even though I pre-checked in and they said it would be ready soon.  Not to mention, I had my reservation in place for a good 5 months in advanced.  It wouldn't have been so bad at that point.  Hey, mistakes happen.  I get it.  However, they did a poor job at rectifying the mistake.

The front desk had horrible communication problems.  Even the one nice girl who tried to be helpful didn't seem properly trained and kept throwing her co-workers under the bus for the mistake instead of taking responsibility (poor team work, come on people) and just making it right.

In the end (after WAY too much negotiating on my part) they gave me a different room, which I had to pay over $100 extra per night (which they tried to tell me is the best discount their manager will allow). I said I should at least get free breakfast for this crap and they FINALLY decided they could let me have 1/2 off (gee thanks).  This whole process took at least an hour and a half of talking to them and getting on the phone with their manager etc.  After a day of traveling and a HUGE wad of money that I put down expecting a luxurious care-free vacation, it's kinda the last thing anyone wants to have to deal with, ya know?

I had a great trip in the end but would not stay here again in fear of what could go wrong the next time.  I'm still a fan of marriott in general but here, the manager needs to better train their front desk staff.Our dinner at Bravo Bistro was fair. Nothing special, nothing to go out of your way for.  The appetizer portions were small. Calamari was very tasty but only provided a few bites. I ordered the linguini in clam sauce. Adequate portion but sauce was tasteless. No garlic flavor, watery and bland. The stuffed eggplant was also bland. We ordered garlic bread for some flavor. What came out for $4.00 a serving were small melba toast-like round crusty pieces of dried out bread. 
The service was great and attentive, but if you want flavorful, interesting food you'll have to go somewhere else.It's in a pretty good location in DT Scottsdale, just slightly off the beaten path.  There's a large area outdoors for those nice fall/winter nights.  

The pros:  the bread (in this case tortilla) is really good.  It's served with a special tasty spread.

The cons: the rest of the food is pretty mediocre.  

Service was not so good for a slow night.  Waiter only came by about twice.As I walked in, I was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry.  But the joint was jumping, there were good-looking pople all around, and I had a good recommendation.  So I took a seat next to the flaming fountain on the patio, and absorbed the cool atmosphere.

I wasn't jazzed about the menu descriptions.  They all sounded dull:  grilled sea bass topped with shrimp over garlic mashed potatoes;  Grilled salmon with an apple glaze; various enchiladas; chicken with penne pasta.  I decided that a place called the tortilla factory has got to have good tacos, so I ordered the house tacos.  How could I go wrong?

I ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter brought some complimentary black bean tortillas with tomato butter.  I wolfed down one thick, leaden, undercooked flour tortilla and pushed the plate away.  Maybe the worst tortilla I've ever had!

The house tacos were just like the fajitas from any chain restaurant:  grilled chicken, steak, and shrimp with accompaniments: guacamole, beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  Shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable.

Each individual item was quite bland.  It all could have used a squirt of lime juice, some cilantro, or even just salt and pepper.  The gilled chicken was as tough as could be.  And the plain flour tortillas were nothing special.   I picked at the steak and shrimp and left the chicken.

Then I made a huge blunder and ate a second black bean burrito.  As I write this review, I can feel this baseball-sized lump of dough in my stomach.   

The atmosphere is cool, but the food stinks.  It reminded me of cafeteria food:  bland, overcooked, and not really fresh.I have been here twice, both were very different experiences. First time ain't half bad, the second time was pretty awful. 

The first time I came here was for a rehearsal dinner (something I learned they are well known for) and had a great time. We sat outside on the patio and it had a very relaxed feel to it. The food was good and they kept the margarita's coming. 

I went here last week and had a really blah experience. I grew up in Tucson so I am used to fantastic Mexican restaurants, and I was wrong to assume that this was in the same boat. I like when menus are five pages long, there are combo plates, rice and beans come with every entree, and chips and salsa are given (not ordered) and continually refreshed as soon as you finish the bowl. Old Town Tortilla Factory had none of those, on top of the fact that there was only one vegetarian option on the entire menu. I ordered the chicken enchiladas (minus chicken, meaning just cheese) and they were not great; they actually had a sour/tart taste to them. 

Our server was also not-so-great, he was MIA for the majority of the meal which made it difficult to get refills, condiments, and our check. Also, it was kind of pricey, especially since the quality was pretty low. 

I will say this, their order of guacamole is large and in charge (about 3 avocados worth) and pretty tasty.Great spot. Bad service and cold food even after asking if they could please reheat 3 of the 4 meals that were served to our party of 4.  As we were walking out I thought the management would appreciate discussing my concern but the management apparently wasn't concerned enough to visit with me.  When you pay for quality service and food you should get it.Only a 2 because of the great atmosphere. The patio and lights were terrific at night.

Unfortunately the food was terrible.  Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  I was vacationing in Phoenix with my wife and fell for the pretty pictures of the patio.

They attempt to be innovative (eg cilantro tortillas with butter for an appetizer ... Which was awful) but it doesn't end up tasting like Mexican food or frankly anything that I'd care to eat

The chili verde was nearly inedible.  The sauce was soupy with very odd flavors and the meat was gristly and of low quality.  

Avoid and hopefully the'll close down and something else will move into this great locationAlthough I did enjoy the food here, I was completely unimpressed (and slightly annoyed) by the overpriced margaritas.  I ordered a platinum which contained "fresh" juice.   It tasted like it had sprite in it, so I thought surely she gave me the wrong one.   It turns out that "fresh juice" is really margarita mix on tap from the same gun as the sprite.   I asked for something fresh to replace the horrible margarita and received a rocks glass with just muddled lime and a salted rim.   I'm not sure it contained any tequila.   Horrible!   It's not that hard to make a fresh margarita!My daughter and I went to the "Award Winning" Old Tortilla Factory having very high hopes for the Mexican food - we're from New Mexico and like hot & spicy.  I thought the courtyard was nice if a little run down (could use a re-fresh).  We  had good service until we were ready for our check - it had gotten busy so we had to flag down our waiter.  The food was just mediocre; not enough spice and flavor.  My daughter had a gargantuan plate of nachos that were just mediocre, nothing special.  I had the shrimp tacos that were flavorless, the corn tortillas were like cardboard and there was no white creamy sauce that's usually served on tacos - rather disappointing.  The best thing we ate were black bean tortillas and herb butter that were not even part of the menu and served as a pre-meal bread.  I wish I had eaten only the black bean tortillas and butter!  This looks like a place that had its' hey-day once and now are just old and tired of it all.  I think it could be brought back with new menus, some bright updated decor, and new management/owners.  We don't have to try this place again; I'm pretty sure the people that really like this place have had a few margaritas before dinner.Ew. Everyone and everything. Every single time I go here it reminds me to stay the F outta Scottsdale. 

I must stress that it's not 6's fault. Its just  that every single miserable person inside 6 kind of sucks. Everyone always looks so unhappy and hateful. Bitches are clocking you left and right. The bottle service chicks always act so bothered to pour you a drink. The dudes look kind of like chicks.

Actually the doormen are always really nice here. I'm surprised at how professional and courtesous they are. The bartenders are pretty on point too.

Oh.. and I always see at least one person I know - and HATE here. Which is kind of awesome. Maybe I like to hate too.

Good thing I'm getting too old for this place. Play nice kiddies because mommy ain't coming back.Came here to get pizza to go & while I waited had some wine and the cheese platter. The platter was massive and well presented however the cheeses were boring. The service was disappointing, the girls were very nice but didn't really know how to manage their time so I spent a lot of time waiting for my server.. Anyway I got my pizza and walked home, I opened the box to discover a good looking pie, which made me smile but when I went to grab a slice, I noticed my server didn't bother to slice it properly or even at all (even though I saw her slicing other pizzas!)

Luckily, I do have a pizza cutter so it worked out. The pizza was good, crispy crust, light toppings. 

All in all it was not what I expected. Give it a try, but I won't be going back.

Happy New Year my darlings !When Grazie first opened my friends and I were regulars here. I am not sure where everything went wrong, but it is really bad now. After dining tonight, I am very certain I will not return. First off we were seTed, and chose our place outdoors. I asked the girl who delivered our water what type of tea they had, she had no clue and had to check, turns out it was Lipton black tea....super difficult to remember one tea. Geez! After that, we waited, and waited and waited and finally I got up to see if we could order- well I found our waitress inside eating at the bar. She popped up and said she had no idea we were out there. Wow, it wasn't even busy. Anyway, she finally took our order and
Came back to tell my Mom the iced tea looked bad and she was making more. She really should have refrained from telling us it looked bad, it totally made me worry about my entire meal. When the pizza arrived, it was VERY average, and the dough was tough, and the sauce was tasteless. I still cannot believe how bad it was, considering all the amazing food I have had here in the
Past. The waitress came out, and noticed I needed a water refill, then noticed my Mom hadn't drank hers, and said "I guess you could have drank hers" WHAT? Really? Umm, NO! I prefer to have my waitress refill MY glass- I told her I was sorry to interrupt her. Ugh! We had also ordered the small dolce when we ordered the pizza... That was really the only decent part of my dinner, and what the 2 stars are for. I don't know if the owner(who was there) has become bored with his restaurant, or the chef is just bad, or what the issues are, but this is in NO WAY the same place my friends and
I spent time and money at. I would HIGHLY recommend ditching the staff, they were horrible, and I mean HORRIBLE! They need to go. I would also dig deep and find the
Passion there was in the beginning. I'm so bummed about this experience.Room smelled like sweaty sneakers.....disgusting!!  Requested a room change and second room wasn't quite as smelly but still had an odor.  Will never stay here again!!tacky.
might work in a real touristy place like key west or Hawaii or maybe even a town with less of a bar scene but it tries too hard.Well the employees there are total cunts, the bartenders were super slow, and the midget thinks he can half ass his job because he's a local celebrity (big deal). some of the food is good however, not exactly healthy but great bar food. Still, it's not worth dealing with the elitists who run the placeMy original review was written just over a year ago, so when I was invited to a baby shower here today I was hoping I would have a better experience. 

I'll start by saying I added one star because it really is just a lovely place, it's too bad the food is so average, and that's being generous. 

I got an iced tea............So over brewed and way too strong, almost bitter. 

I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad (see pics) marinated and grilled shrimp, baby lettuces, diced avocado, baby tomatoes, goat cheese, grilled corn and lime vinaigrette topped with frizzled tortillas, sounds delicious no? 

No is right! Seriously the vinaigrette was all oil, no lime or acidity at all, there wasn't enough of anything on the salad to get a good bite of all the flavors bland as they were, and the fried tortilla strips were old and very greasy, really a $14 salad should be nothing less than divine. 

My daughter got the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich (see pics) $12 
albacore tuna, pecans, jicama, scallions, cucumbers and purple cabbage on sunflower , whole wheat bread with potato salad. 

Again sounds Delicious but was less than stellar. 

The Tuna mixture had a decent flavor but the tuna wasn't even mixed thoroughly, it was in large chunks straight from the can. 

The potato salads potatoes were barley done, almost crunchy and lacking any flavor that would make me want to continue eating nearly raw potatoes. 

The atmosphere isn't enough to intoxicate my senses into believing I'm eating something amazing. How unfortunate that so many can be blinded by a "trend" because the food is just not all that.This place is like an outdoor garden at someone's great-aunt's home in the Hamptons. We were seated immediately at a wrought-iron table outside under some misters and handed menus. It was a good 10 minutes before our server came out to take our beverage order and the only reason I stayed that long was because my escort excused himself to take a phone call. However, when our server did come by, she was super-nice. My Bee Eff had two eggs with bacon and I ordered some Frenchie-sounding crepe dish with ham and gruyere cheese, "with a creamy bechamel sauce."
Another 10 minutes goes by before she drops off our iced tea and orange juice, which are served in those wine-looking water glasses with the stems, and they're both sucked down pretty fast. And then we've got two empty glasses on the table, and no one ever comes back to see if we need a refill. At this point I am periodically checking the time because hey, it's hot outside and we have nothing to drink, and our server is seemingly nowhere in sight! Several minutes pass before she drops off a carafe of iced tea and some waters. Another TWENTY minutes and our food comes out, his is missing toast and mine looks revolting. But I'm really into crepes and I'm pretty open-minded about food so I dive in. Another five minutes goes by before he gets his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauce anywhere in the building, nor in the building across the street that servers have had to run to in order to get things that are obviously missing from the restaurant (it seems that the company owns both properties but you'd think they would keep all of their restaurant stuff in one convenient location...). 
My date's food was "eh, no big deal. Eggs and bacon... you really can't screw that up." 
My crepes were the best part of the dish. They were the perfect consistency, thin, no lumps, no weird fried edges. I liked the CREPES. However... I was under the impression that the filling was to be ham and gruyere and it was ham lunchmeat only, not what I was expecting. The crepes were swimming in a watery, milky sauce that needed salt or some other seasoning (not quite the creamy bechamel I was expecting) and the gruyere was sprinkled across the top. So visually, if you can picture this: White cat vomit. But I was starving at that point and I liked the crepes part so I ate it. 
And then I wanted to pay and leave. And we couldn't even do that because like the entire experience thus far: no server to be found. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike her. I mean, when she did come around, she was one of the nicest servers I've ever had. She was just inattentive to her tables on the front patio. Getting the check took another fifteen and then I was ready to pay and it took so much longer waiting for no one to come back that it got to the point where I had to get up, go inside and stand in the kitchen while someone else rang me up. 

Bottom line: Mediocre, overpriced food ($40 for two small breakfasts and no booze), shit service. Not going back.This place loses another star for employing a Gestapo-like Valet service that prevents anyone from parking on 1st Avenue  who is looking to eat somewhere else like America's Tacos.  I am baffled that Valet service exists out here and that they can successfully block off more than half the street.Extremely over rated restaurant the food is very bland. You can open any bag of lettuce and dress it poorly to get the same result. The service was terrible. The waitresses are rude and once they take your order you will never see them again 

When I asked what was recommended the waitress was completely put out. When i asked for a four top in the main dining room the miserable idiot they hired for a hostess could not have been less gracious., she wanted to put us in the back shitty add on when the main dining room was 1/2 full  Their style is pure 70's shabby chic gone stale. The food cannot amaze anyone unless you have been living on hospital food. Do not waste your time and money. This place has jumped the shark.The spicy wings are good, they would have been better if they were warmer.  You have to order your food at the counter but that's okay there was not a long wait.

The restaurant is really small and weird looking. I also noticed they had a huge menu that included pizza, subs & salads! I might go back when I'm in the mood for cold wings...maybe :-).Great renovated suite. The lobby, gym and surrounding areas were just great. However, when I first arrived, at around 10 p.m., the valet wasn't outside, but watching from inside. Hubby and I had to lug our luggage in as the front desk guy and valet guy just watched from inside. Apparently 60 degree weather is too cold for Arizonans to go outside and help their guests. 

Upon check in, the front desk guy said we could park in the private garage for something like $15 a day or, and he recommended this option, go park in front of the hotel on the street or across the street. The valet perked up at this point and pointed toward two spots available on the street near the corner. He was very clear and said, "Look, there's two spots right there." Hubby carried the bags to the room and I moved the car exactly where I was told. In the morning, I found a parking ticket. That strip is apparently no parking because it's a trolley stop. You'd think the hotel would know that, or at least NOT recommend that I specifically park there.

Not cool, Marriott, not cool. I'll be writing a letter to the manager with a copy of the ticket asking for a check to pay it.Went for the Great Arizona Picnic on Saturday and was not that impressed. When I go to something like this I expect to try something new and exciting. What did I get here? The same Spinato's pizza and Salty Senorita food I can get out in town, not to mention mega chains like Buffalo Wild Wings, The Melting Pot and Chipotle. Meh... The Abolut tent was nothing special either, I mean, you can get that stuff in any bar. Why stand around with a bunch of D-bags in a tiny fenced in area fighting to get a drink?

Let me sum up the event...
1. Wait in line to get in...
2. Wait in line to get a 21 year old wrist band...
3. Wait in line to get tickets...
4. Wait in line to get food...
5. Wait in line to get into the Beer/Absolut/Patron areas...
6. Wait in line for a drink...
7. Wait in line for the Port O Potty...
Repeat steps 3-7...

The only bright spot was the beer garden, got to try a lot of unique beers that I have never seen in any stores in Phoenix, so that was kinda cool.The Fest !!!   2 words - money pit !!!
Aside from a perfect day and plenty of talent to hang out with , this thing is poorly coordinated. So here's the scenario - stand in line to pay the entry fee , stand in line to buy tickets. , stand in  an even bigger line to get in the beer gardens , stand in line to buy cocktails. Stand in line to buy food  - then when the tickets run out. , stand in line again to do it all p we again
I would have gladly purchased am entire bottle of booze as opposed to the 2 drink limit per person !! 
Needs alot of workThe event seems as if passed in another lifetime, yet simultaneously, I recall it as if it were only but a moment ago.

Clear as ever, it haunts my reverie and dashes my tourist-y vintage soda shop dreams to smithereens... nothing more than ancient affections, now turned to dust.

What could possibly tarnish my fond childhood recollections of the Sugar Bowl?

Him. He sat there, idle, fondling a morsel of something. Suddenly, he was off... advancing towards the counter at lightning speed, straight towards my prized possession. 

He approached it without hesitation, and before I knew it, a cockroach had crawled up my sundae.

'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.... save for when you unknowingly loved something infested with cockroaches. Then, it becomes debatable.For nostalgic purposes only. The ice cream and sundaes are weak and it is looking so grungy and run down these days. Get your sweets fix elsewhere.One star for the unbelievable wine selection. There is something on the bottle list for everyone. If you do not find what you want, the staff is more than happy to make recommendations based on your preference. 

One star for the past experiences that I have had at this establishment. It is a wonderful place to take a date or a client on a slow night. I have had impeccable service in the past.

My second to latest trip was sub-standard. I decided to give it a go with a group of friends for a special event and, again, very dissatisfied. I am not sure what happened but, I will never choose to go here with others unless they absolutely have the need.I love Nordstrom, let me start off my saying that.  But the last few times I have been there, going back to the holiday season, the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely, to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.

This time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted, picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someone's attention.  I knew what I wanted, knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someone's attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said "Um, I guess there is no one else around" grabbed the shoe from me and said "what size?"  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds, got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.  If you are selling high end stuff maybe you should start hiring high end people and not people who think they are above anyone because the "basic" customer is your repeat customer who will probably end up spending more money with you over the course of a year than the one time shopper!I've been a loyal Nordy's customer for years. I even worked there for about four years in the past.
In recent years, it sure seems their customer service is slipping.
Men's Rail never has been a department I've recognized for their customer service. It was never bad service by any means, It just wasn't Nordstrom quality service. I've felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase, thought friendly, they never seemed to care much. It's the department I do the majority of my Nordstrom shopping, but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip (no matter how recent), I've never been sent a thank-you card, and though I have asked numerous times, I've never been called about sales or new items.
I will describe my last couple visits to the Rail.
Earlier this year I was rummaging through a sale rack. I was completely ignored, while the three associates there helped customers who were perusing the regular priced racks. Not only that, but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts (that i was holding in my hand). One girl said she wasn't sure if she liked it, she'd have to see it on her boyfriend, but it might be "too ugly" for her to let him wear. The other girl replied "Yeah, the color is a little gay." Now, they weren't talking about it because it was in my hand, and I don't feel they were homophobi
My last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store.
I had another pair of jeans I brought in for a repair. I was again offered an exchange but I was insistant on the rapair because I really loved them and they didn't have them anymore. I was wanting a small tear repaired and was originally planning on shipping them out to New York to have them rewoven. I instead opted to try Nordstrom, hoping to save a few bucks (atleast the cost of shipping to and from NYC). Well I was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as "Customer's own goods, no charge". I told her the jeans are a couple years old, it's just from wear and tear, not a defect. I was told not to worry about it and needless to say I was very excited. I was planning on spending about $20-25 for the repair. I asked how the repair would be done and they said they would be rewoven. Even better! So I clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched. I was told yes, that was correct.
So they took them in and gave me the date of 6/4 that I could come in and pick them up. Well that date came and went. I was so busy I didn't get a chance to go get them. No big deal, I wasn't in a rush. On 6/12, the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if I had wanted them shortened. I said no, just the repair that I brought them in for. He didn't know what repair and I described what I wanted. He told me he just found the original slip, the pants had not been touched yet, but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge. He said I should get them by Saturday or Monday.
Well that didn't happen. I called this past Thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation. He said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day.
That didn't happen either. I called back the next day. He tells me "I'm sorry, you must not have gotten my message." Well of course I didn't get your message! You didn't call me so you obviously didn't leave me a message either!
Well that is what I wanted to say. But I was nice. He said the jeans were going out that day. That DID happen and I got them the following day!!
Thankfully they had not been shortened, but they also were not rewoven. They were patched and then stitched over the patch. I'm annoyed, but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job. The work is very subtle and hardly noticeable.
This is just not the level of service I would expect from this store, regardless of what department I am in. I know I probably shouldn't complain about a free service, but I didn't expect or ask for it to be free...Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.I'm not a big fan... I ordered take out and got everything I asked for but all the food was lacking in flavor and freshness.. The chips were nothing special and the only thing I appreciated was the gentleman who had made the food, he was very nice but the lady was not.Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?In Minneapolis the Original Pancake House is a high-end establishment.  We were vacationing in Fountain Hills and wanted a treat so we trekked to Scotsdale for bfast.  We were a bit leery when we saw the exterior and the adjoining Motel 6.  The menu was very similar to what we're used to, as was the food.  The decor, service and the signs were joke-like...reminded me of Ed Debevics where they treat you poorly as part of the abiance, only they are not trying to be funny at OPH.  Signs tell you to turn off your phone, don't bring in drinks (coffee, is my guess?), don't expect to be seated until your entire party is there and CASH ONLY.  Our waitress was such a crank!What a disappointment.  Nothing special about this place, located in the front parking lot of Motel 6.  We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the CASH ONLY sign and the NO CELL PHONES ALLOWED sign.  I maybe get the cash only thing since it's in close proximity to a Motel 6, but does a casual breakfast diner type establishment have to tell you not to use your cell phone?

The prices do not equal the quality and definitely not the quantity of their food.  I ordered the bacon waffle ($8.50), but it looked more like a pancake waffle (flat) with, I swear, one strip of bacon crumbled on top.  I did not taste any "bits of bacon" inside the waffle.  Bleh.  My friend had the strawberry waffle, also flat, which turned out to be the best tasting thing at the table,  The guys both ordered sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes.  Pancakes weren't bad, but like I said earlier, nothing special.  One of the hashbrowns was forgotten.  Coffee was good.  Service was friendly but average.  Our bill came out to $40, but honestly it wasn't worth it.

The next morning, we drove a little further and found a Cracker Barrel.  And there you have it.Really not all that happy with the experience we had tonight. 

We were told to move lanes three different times. 

First time: we were placed too close to the league games and might disrupt them, so we were told to move ONE lane over. Huge difference, I know.

Second time: the lane they moved us into was broken somehow. The computer kept glitching and getting off sync with the game.

Third time: the computer screen worked but the overhead tv did not. 

It's a strange environment, there are signs for food EVERYWHERE. On the walls, on the booths, on the tvs,  in the bathroom. I mean seriously. It's creepy. And then you look at the leaguers and suddenly realize why they're all overweight. You can't even call it subliminal messages because they're so overt and in your face.

Everything here is shabby and old, which I guess that's what bowling is... But does it have to be that way? Especially for the money we all pay? I mean come on.Meh more or less sums up my experience. Crusty waitress who, when asked for a recommendation summed it up as "everything is good on the menu" to fish tacos that had giant fish filets on them and not a great selection of garnish. Even if the garnish selection had been spectacular, the amount of fish over-powered every other flavor.This place is okay.  Food is fair, service fair but slow, drinks ( weak ), price a little high.  I have gone for happy hour a few times and the burger is good but after that very disappointing.  Modeled a little after Houston's that where the comparisons stop.... Food is nowhere near Houston's.  Drinks are all water and they charge you for a double if you order vodka on the rocks... Really!!!  My advise head down to old town.... It is 1 mile south!Let me start by saying the food was delicious and cooked to our liking. However, the portions were very small. Don't come here if you are looking for the "Hungryman" dinner. The service was where our family was greatly disappointed. We waited far too long to receive the next course (15+ minutes) and our waiter was no where to be found, never checking to see how we liked our dinner. My water glass set empty during half the meal until I snagged a busboy to fill it for me. I saw our waiter only once during the meal when he did a "flyby" through his serving area, not making eye contact with any of his tables. We waited and waited to order an after dinner beverage and when it was finally brought to the table, our waiter tried to leave both glasses with the closest person rather than distribute them accordingly. Our waiter shall go nameless here as I do not wish to humiliate openly on the web, but something was not quite right with this guy! Not just his absence, but his actions, speech, facial expressions and demeanor. I think that this establishment needs to reevaluate its hiring/training standards.where is the love? something was missing with my last visit to Joe's New York Pizza.......where is Joe?!?! i admit it has been at least a year since i have been in there last.( i got hooked on the other side of the street with best of Italy pizza) i couldn't get enough people to agree on one type of pie so i got a few slices.  They were big slices and the crust was thin, they might have had a chance if they were not "marinating" in the window for an hour.  i like to load up on parm and crushed red pepper after I'm through with condiments it all tastes the same but nothing i can do can hide far from fresh product.  if you find yourself on that side of town and need late night food check out Best of italy or Philly Sandwich(24hrs!!!wtf) on 5th ave and scottsdaleNot the best place. Sure, it's good for a quick bite for those who aren't too selective, but you can find much better pizza elsewhere. The pizza just isn't that impressive. Too greasy, and pretty bland, to be honest. It wasn't terrible, but I regretted ordering from this restaurant.Thai fusion is more like it.

I love Thai food but Malee's is more Thai fusion.  Don't come here if you're looking for authentic Thai food. The food is alright, there are dishes on the menu that you won't find in normal thai cuisine like the Crispy Calamari Salad, although it was good.

They pump up the AC so the room is freezing and I think the building is old because the acoustics are awful. You can hear every conversation in the room and it's all echoing so you won't be able to hear yourself think!

If you don't mind less than average Thai food, freezing conditons and lots of noise than Malee's is the place for you.  I probably won't be back...We arrived close to closing (an early 9pm) and got a perfunctory 'you'd better order right now' from the hostess.  A scowling white guy was checking something on a monitor as we walked past the entrance, and as we are seated I notice a row of dirty glasses left on a window ledge at our table.  I get a very un-Thai like calimari salad that is only mildy interesting, while my gf has something I ate a lot of, but cannot remember.  For a restaurant with a higher price tag than other local Thai places, and a very nice address smack in the middle of Old Scottsdale, I would have expected more.Three times is my limit for this over hyped, over priced, non unique, and non delicious place. I don't know why so many people recommend it. Its genuinely non special and non memorable. And they charge you extra for tofu even though its replacing meat in the dish. And I got three tiny slivers of tofu in my curry last night. Boring and overpriced.This place is slightly scary... Food in cases as soon as you walk in looks horrid... I got a veggie dish that wasn't horrible but I won't be back.  One vegetarian option only and the place just has a sad run down feel to it....I was totally razzed about trying out Sasson Salon due to all the great reviews. I've been living here in AZ for about 4 years and searching for the perfect cut and had yet to experience it. Or when I did, her schedule didn't jive with mine.

So I gave them a try and was booked with Ronoldo. My appointment was one of the last ones of the day and it was pretty much emptying out when I arrived. He was cutting someone's hair  when I arrived. I'm fine with waiting around, but half an hour later passed and I was still waiting! After half an hour I had my hair washed and he came over for a minute to see what kind of cut I was interested in. I think he assumed since I had a picture of my kids on my phone that I was okay not being at home and it was a break away and made a comment that implied that. Heck yeah, I appreciate a break from home but waiting around for half an hour isn't exactly relaxing!

Anyways, I told him what I liked. My hair at that time was cut pretty decent. I could air dry and have nice wavy, beachy curls and look pretty good if I don't say so myself! I told him I liked my hair like it was now and if he could trim it up that was fine, and I offered him the opportunity to suggest if he could think of another style for me, and he didn't really answer. I also told him that when I didn't wear my hair like this I liked to flat iron it. My hair is super thick so it's easy for me to look like Cousin It when I want to!

Anyways, all said and done and 1 1/2 hour later I came out looking like I had a mom hair cut. It was neither wavy curly nor flat ironed like I liked. (I think he called it a wrap style? Just blow drying and wrapping the hair around my scallp to straighten it out)  In the end I felt like it was the end of his day and he was ready to head out and he could care less.

I had read some reviews out here about how they considered not only how your hair looks that day but how it would looks in a month or two when it grows out. Unfortunately I still hate it 2 months later. I like the salon but maybe not the stylists work. Looks like Ben's the way to go next time...Or to just find a new salon!We really wanted some indian food...so we went to Jewel of the Crown for take out.  It was Saturday night and there were about 20 people dining so we felt like at lease some people were eating there.

We ordered shish kabob...it ended up being dried up and spiced oddly...we could not stomach eating it.

The vegie korma was ok but had huge...not bite size vegies in it.  Like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato.

The Chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice.

The rice and nan were fine.  

I guess we were expecting something really great and it was so so...next time we will try a different place until we find an Indian place that is better:(Naan is good but the rest of the food is blandLet me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad. 

We (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible. 

I know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.Loved the atmosphere and great customer service, but the food was bland (at best) and the prices are too high.More of a Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food.  Had the chicken & shrimp enchiladas.  Rice was very dry.  Green chile sauce overpowered taste of chicken and shrimp.  Husband had the pork burrito with red sauce.  Had good flavor but was spicy.  Also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting.  Very bland.  Needed salt and pepper.  Sopa tasted like toasted bread.  Great service but overall food disappointing.I have always been a big fan.  A frequent patron for 10+ years.   This weekend my father and I went for lunch;   the Carne Adovada was very good, however the Pozole was cool and fatty.   And the Tesuque salad was lacking dressing, and the chicken was bland.   Could be a hit if better prepared.   I will visit again.Update 5/7/08---
I had no choice but to bump this down to 2 stars.  While it was nice, again, to be on the winning side of the day's golf and therefore receiving a free meal I didn't walk out feeling like a winner.  The service is still very attentive and the place is cool to see but the food is at best average.  The cuts of meat were marginal, not bad but nothing special at all, and were cooked inconsistently and not always to order.  In general it just came across as a novelty experience - lots of sports memorabilia eye candy with food as a secondary consideration.  We were a big group last year and an even bigger one this year but I'm pretty sure there won't be a next year for us at D&C.

This is a 3.5 star rating.  At times I find myself adding points for one aspect only to deduct some for an entirely different reason.  I guess that makes this place a bit of an enigma to me.  I am left thinking of it as a classic throwback blue-collar sports bar B.B.Q.-joint diner steakhouse with an interesting atmosphere.

I was in the Scottsdale area as part of a group of 12 guys on an annual golf outing and this was the third and final dinner of the trip and served as the high priced ($40/guy) loss for the losing team (of which I unfortunately was a member).

The food was good - they definitely know how to cook meat.  I had the 12 oz. filet and it was cooked exactly as the waitress described medium rare - pink and warm in the middle.  The guys sitting on either side of me each ordered different steaks cooked to different levels and both seemed equally satisfied.  I also really enjoyed my iceberg wedge salad - it was huge and fresh - but that shouldn't be hard to get right.  My double baked potato was fine and desserts were at best average.  I had the flourless chocolate cake which was fine but the banana cream pie was essentially whipped cream on top of banana pudding.

The atmosphere was not exactly what I expected although I didn't really know what to expect.  When I think 'steakhouse' I think two things.  First is a somewhat dark dining area with booths and a sort of intimate feel to it and second is a menu that features various steak/prime rib cuts along with token chicken, fish and pasta selections.  Don & Charlie's is none of this.  Then again it is not strictly a steakhouse.  The dining area is essentially one big, brightly lit room with no booths and a fairly loud din.  It, along with virtually every part of the building, is covered with sports memorabilia.  The menu is broad enough that you actually have to look for the steak section.  Being there for the reason I was made these variances a positive to me but on other occasions they could just as easily have been a negative

Random notes:  The service was great in a very straightforward way.  With such a large group it is almost inevitable that when the food comes out there is some confusion about who ordered what.  But we experienced none of that.  People were served what they ordered and without any chaos.  Bud Selig, of "Chopped Steak a la Bud Selig" fame, or is it Commissioner of MLB fame, was there.  Valet parking at $5 was expensive and an out of place option given the rest of the experience.

The main thing that made me round down to 3 stars was the price.  It's just too expensive for what you get.  I didn't see the final bill but it must have been $45+/guy without drinks.  I have no problem paying that kind of money for a meal but I have had many better meals for that kind of money.  It was fun to see the sports stuff but ultimately it is about the dining experience and, on the whole, for the price it really was average.Why is this place still here?

Dust off the nostalgia and baseball memorabilia, cuz that's the ONLY reason you should eat here.  The service is pedestrian, the place is stuffy and the food just meh.  

And the wine list!  For a steak house, I'd expect something more than 10 grocery store selections listed on the back of the menu.  Yes, the BACK of the food menu!  Let's see...I'll take the Kendall Jackson Cab for $40.  If you're going to bend me over on wine prices, at least let me pick something that isn't on sale at Basha's!  

With so many better food options in Scottsdale, why is this place still here?The bread was sub-par as the bagel was crisp and overly salty. The butter was frozen and un-spreadable. 

The calamari was OK not the best and not memorable. 

Service-The waitress was polite, but not as interested in us as we did not order an inordinate amount of booze. The busser touched my father's fork on the head of it instead of the handle. Yuck.

The steaks were OK but I've had better at Texas Road House to be quite honest. The additional char on the steaks is worth it, and makes a definite difference as my dad had his prepared this way and I did not.

The gold brick dessert was pretty good, but the chocolate was very frozen.First impression walking into this place was not good. This bar smells bad and is dirty. A good cleaning and basic maintenance is needed. 

Also the staff was rude and unprofessional, especially the bar tender Kelly. We were not treated like guessed in this establishment but more like intruders. My group felt unwelcome and uncomfortable. We moved a table so we could sit together and we were quickly reprimanded by the bartender for doing so. After a friend of mine commented on our negative experience, things changed. The staff seemed overly friendly and that was awkward as well. Kelly walked over to every table and apologized for herself and gave way to much personal information about how she was feeling.

The live music was amazing! If you have to go into this dirty place the music will make your experience more enjoyable.

We won't be going back. We will find a more friendly/clean place to listen to live music.The economy is in the shitter and I KNOW NM is suffering. You would think that upper management would have spread the word that now is the time to be friendly to customers. I realize this is a foreign concept. I'm not a high roller or anything, but I do spend serious cash when provoked. I bought my first Balenciaga bag a couple years ago, and did get a nice thank-you card from the SA; however, when the tassels started to split six months later, I inquired about replacements. Crickets. No follow up. That is sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. 

When I bought another Balenciaga, the guy working barely stopped checking out all the passersby long enough to ring me up. Barely a thank-you. No note. And this was just a few months ago, when we all knew for real what kind of economic shit the economy was in. Sloppy.

The straw was broken this past weekend, when I stopped by to redeem a frequent shopper gift card. The snotty blonde cow working at the Chanel counter looked outwardly irritated by my purchases. She made sure to make handwritten notes all over my receipt and the NM stickers on the products themselves that they were purchased with said gift card. What, so I don't sneak back and try to return a half-used $30 mascara? Seriously? 

Now that bad-ass Barney's is in town, NM has got some serious competition. You'd think on opening weekend, NM would have been making an extra effort, not staffing the most popular cosmetics counters with angry cougars who act like their estrogen prescription ran out without refills. No thanks - I think I'm officially done.Typical strip mall restaurant in South Scottsdale.  Looks totally outdated inside.  Covering up pasta with an overdose of sauce should be criminal. Clearly no love for food in the kitchen. So not impressed.Well, having grown up in this town since 1949 I can think of a couple older establishments.  The Pink Pony, before it moved, and the Ranch House for hamburgers that is now sitting just east of the ballpark.  The building that housed  "Lute's" and the bar that had the original bank on Main Street to name a few.This place had nice lighting. A lot of Christmas type lights that made it alright. The place would have been great off the strength of what it looked like, the people in there killed it. If someone is coming toward the bar, that is your queue to move, these bastards didn't and looked at me like I was crazy.Interesting place. I used to study in Spain and thought some of the food was pretty good...rest was bland. Sangria had one little orange slice. Water waitress wouldn't leave us alone. She must have come to our table 15 times to fill up our water glasses, even if they were still full. Another waiter was trying to clear everything off of our table at rapid speed. I felt rushed even though it was empty on a Saturday night.


I had an expired Groupon that I was going to use paid value for. My aunt had a coupon from entertainment book for one free entrée, however we weren't allowed to use coupon. My aunt tried to explain to manager that the groupon wasn't a coupon since it expired. We were just using it as cash value. However, he failed to understand and was rude.

Oh, and food was overpriced in relation to decor and service.I didn't know Ra was a chain.

The only reason why we stopped in here was because I heard the happy hour specials were awesome.

Well, price-wise I was impressed.  Taste-wise, I can't complain given that it's a chain restaurant.  I will add that we were the only Asians in the restaurant so no Japanese employees.

The fact that they serve the "beer and sake" special with the ochoko inside the beer mug is a strong indication of the clientle at this establishment.Trendy, over priced, typical snotty scottsdale attitudes. The only thing they have that I adore is their iced green tea. It is super yummy, but not worth enduring the price and attitude for.RA to me is what Dorsia is to Patrick Bateman. The sushi is "meh." and people go because it's trendy as fleck. I spent most of my experience at the bar, so It's halfway decent as in "Another Sapporo? Duh." (hence the 2 stars). That classic line "it is what it is" reeks.. To shed some light, it's a good spot to meet friends before you head to venue #2. I think the only authentic Japanese item in this place was my watch. Just sayin'.I like their food & drinks and they have some good deals. I've never had good luck with the service at this location though. I had a big birthday dinner here a couple years ago and they insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. This sounded too good to be true for call ahead seating so I called back and talked to someone else who also insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. We did call-ahead seating, we got there, we waited for an hour, and we finally split up and sat at opposite corners of the restaurant for dinner. If they hadn't been so insistent that everything would work out great and that we could sit together and wouldn't have to wait, we definitely would have gone someplace that takes reservations! RA in Scottsdale is only good for groups if you & your friends are up for doing sake bombs in the bar for 2 hours while you wait for your table. ;)I'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants. I will readily admit that.  In fact, I think this may be the first one I've reviewed. I've been to Olive Garden, Chili's, etc., but I've never given enough of a crap about my experiences there--good OR bad--to write about it. I'm only reviewing this one because it popped up on my list of places I'd been when I checked in on Yelp today, and I did have a pretty irritating experience there last month. So here we are.

We came to the Scottsdale Ra a couple of years ago when I was in town for my cousin's wedding. The experience wasn't bad, as I recall, but it also wasn't great. Overall, pretty forgettable. My sister and her husband seemed to really like it, though, so when we found out we'd be back in the area this spring, they wanted to be sure we ate here for lunch one day.

The vegetarian selections here are slim. And that's me being nice. There's edamame and a tofu appetizer, but those aren't really substantial enough to be considered a meal. The one "vegetarian" roll I saw came covered in eel sauce. I mentioned to the server that I was a veg and asked if the eel sauce actually contained real eel. His response?

"Yeah, but it's only like 4% eel. The rest is water and sugar. It's really good."

Well, thank goodness I'm only a 96% vegetarian, right? After explaining that ANY fish would be a nonstarter for me, I asked if the eel sauce could be left off.

"Do you just want it, like, on the side?"

No, person who clearly doesn't understand the concept of vegetarianism. I don't want any. At all. Ever. We finally got things figured out and he marked me down for a veggie tempura roll, minus the offending liquid fishparts.

So when the food came out covered in brown sauce, I was kinda surprised. I thought we'd covered that. The food runner, of course, had no idea, but as soon as the server saw it he realized the mistake and took it back. Which is to his credit, because at least he noticed. However, I did have to wait an extra fifteen minutes for my roll to come out while my travel companions started in on theirs.

When it did finally arrive--without sauce this time--my server also brought me a coupon for a free appetizer at any Ra location. There's one in our area here in Kansas, so I was at least vaguely interested in using it. However, upon closer inspection, I realized it was expired by about a month. Points for trying, I suppose.

I think next time I'll definitely suggest finding a local place to try, since having the resources of a large chain obviously doesn't mean the experience or the food will be anything to write home about.This place used to be my favorite sushi place when I first started going about 9 years ago. As the years go by, the quality, freshness, and taste of the food has failed to please. I used to recommend this place to friends and visitors, but now I can't even get myself to go in there for a meal.Food was mediocre.  Margs were decent.  Service was so-so.  Nothing really all that special to Yelp about.  Just another mediocre food experience.  Being surrounded by good friends made the night.  We sat on patio and sweated our asses off.  The misters didn't help but the margs did.  I wanted water but they never re-filled it so I came home really thirsty.  The food looked better than it tasted. I had the tacos and I wanted the shells to be better than the store bought ones but that is all they had.  My husband had the fish tacos-- it was more like a civeche in a soggy corn tortilla.  

Just, you know, not the best you can get that is for sure.It's not my fave, but it's not awful.  A couple friends drug me here earlier today... I was wanting basic tacos and/or light apps and good margaritas, like what you'd find on a happy hour menu, but the girlfriend wanted "good mexican food" and didn't want to try a new spot fearing she might be left disappointed. They (she and her man) advised me if I hadn't had the cheese crisp and F & L's, i hadn't yet lived. A cheese crisp was ordered and they were correct in that it is not the crappy thin tortilla with burnt cheese that i've seen in other establishments. Its almost a crust and there is a nice amount of cheese, with a lil pico, shredded lettuce and sour cream to accompany. It was fairly spicy and tasted like jalapenos had been rubbed all over it, but it was a good spicy.  Much to my dismay, there was no happy hour on the weekend.  =/  I ordered a large house margarita. It wasn't great. I looooove margaritas and this one leaves you wanting to go somewhere for a good house margarita (like Cien Agave?)  For food, i had the chicken chimichanga with both red and green sauces (no fancy taco creations here folks, just traditional mexican food.) Red is spicy! Green is almost flavorless in comparison. The rice was decent and the beans were really good. They were the one thing I finished on my plate! I should also give props to the server as he was prompt and attentive!
F & L's is decent, but not my cup of tea. I'll stick to the taquerias from now on!The only thing that must keep this place alive is a great outdoor patio and good location. The service is awful, as in it's painfully obvious the management has no commitment to serving the customer. Sat down on a less than busy Sunday evening, and waited 15 minutes before drink orders were taken. After emptying the first glass the food arrived, and the drinks were not refilled until 3/4 of the way through the meal. What server doesn't check in on drinks, especially when the food arrives? I also had to go to the bar to get my silverware. The food is at the lower end of the spectrum on quality, considering the multitude of options.  

I was angry when I paid the bill, and wish I had picked someplace else. With a lot of options, this place is a no go. Take Filberto's to the park, and the squirrels will likely service you better. Win -win. 

Plus, don't order an extra basket of chips, that will cost you. WTF.Never returning again. The service was slow, the food wasn't hot, the drinks seemed watered down. Their food wasn't at all tasty. It seemed as though they didn't marinate their flavors together when it came to food. The place is cute, but the lack of attention from their staff, the subpar drinks and the tasteless food will not make me a regular. I put full bar as an option when prompted but they really don't have a full bar since they only have a few top shelf choices.Nice ambiance in the patio area behind, but the food is mediocre at best. Soggy and bland tacos. Very slow service and a bit uptight as well, like not enough help.I give up.  This joint smells great from the street but The pizza tastes like shit. The waiter must have been having a sales contest as he kept pushing a 60 dollar bottle of wine.....to wash down this swill?  The red sauce has no flavor. The garlic will leave you reeking for hours. The salads are ok, nothing special. I guess, if you have kids and need to eat this is alright but not a destination by any stretch.We ate here while on a weekend get away. When we first walked in I could not figure out if it were a bar or restaurant. We looked at the menu and decided to give it a try. 

We were seated by the host who appeared to be drunk because he was pretty damn obnoxious. 

We waited for 7 minutes before we got a menu. Once the menu finally arrived we put in a drink order because the service was obviously going to be slow.........and boy was it slow! 

We ordered calamari, mussels, and a caesar salad after waiting for what seemed like forever. 

The calamari was good but nothing special, the mussels were pretty awesome, and the caesar salad was not that great and had no taste. 

The waiter never offered any parmesan cheese or cracked pepper for the caesar salad and was no where to be found for us to make the request. 

The mussels were good but everything else including the drink was not good and the service was basically non existent.it's been a while since the one and only time i went here, but it deserves a review, simply because of what happened there.

we were well on our way to having a hang over the next day, which seems like the only way to go to this bar. 

we walked in (group of 6), and managed to find a table, inside, where the karaoke was happening. we're not that into karaoke, but it is free entertainment.

as soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened.

some dude, about 5'2" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show. 

we all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly. 

that's not why i'm giving this 2 starts. we were there a good 15 minutes total, and never saw a server. more beer might have saved the situation, in some way. with no beer in sight, we bolted. we couldn't handle another episode like that, with nothing to wash it down with.Took forever to sing one song. Was not a regular, but dang.The restaurant part & upstairs area looked cute. You can come here to watch people karaoke while sipping on some drinks.Here for karaoke. The server couldnt care less about her section...the decor here is dusty and old, makes me fearful to even order food.On a Sunday afternoon we happened to run into my in-laws in old town, so we decided to find a place to sit down and grab drinks and possibly appetizers.  When we walked in the hostess was hesitant on seating us on the roof if we weren't going to eat. We said we weren't sure yet. It wasn't like it was full - there was perhaps 2 tables seated up there. So she finally sat us up there and we might have ordered food except service was so slow.  I don't think we'll return.Went to Bandara tonight.  We ordered the prime rib and it camr our RARE,  very rare. We sent it back and guess what they stuck it under the salimander.  How embarrasing.  I confronted the manager and he wasnt very happy.  We re ordered  and on the third try it was rare but not as much.  I have seen a drop in quality over the past year.The set-up is completely bizarre for a show where the typical divisive practices of club-owners bottleneck the 'kiddie section' dead center in front of the stage, which is the 'no-fly zone' for alcohol.  

This arrangement sets up the now-famous 'awkward 20 foot gap' between showpiece and fully-anticipatory-audience who is inebriated enough to dance and cheer instead of the tweener crowd in full cross-armed bashful gawkiness.  The drinking audience is so colossally detached from the musical climate of the show that it is truly insignificant whether or not they actually attended.  

I went here with Graham C and Natalie G to see Voxtrot and Au Revoir Simone and all of  this foolishness climaxed when the three bandmates from ARS had to break the 21 and under barrier just to show headliners Voxtrot some love by peacocking around the dance floor in the general vicinity of the band.  No one else was willing to give up their beers to participate.

There is generally no alternative options when presented with the venue of  choice where a band you wanna hear is playing  ... but if its a band you only 'kinda wanna hear', its not really worth the hassle or boredom.  There's really no excuse for a club owner to have a crummy live music venue.  Those are simple dynamics to work out.The location is fantastic. With the back drop of Camelback mountain and McCormick ranch just around the corner, it is one of the nicest locations in terms of ambiance and people watching, and that's why they get that extra star. Staff us also friendly and helpful but for the life of me I can't get myself to spend south in a cup of coffee. Yes it's pretty good,bug the l and pop shops just around the corner are just as good without the necessary bank loan required. Just my 2 cents.Forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once, shame on you. Forget them twice, shame on me. The third time and Pei Wei is officially dead to me. Awful service and I was promised a credit for my jacked up un-lettuce wraps that has yet to happen. And I tried to call. Three times. And all three times some airhead hung up on me. Unacceptable. Stay away!This will be short and sweet...which i usually don't do. AJ's fine foods...has fine food and great presentation...but the prices are absolutely not worth it for the exact same products at other stores. I guess there is only one kind of customer that would shop here...and that is a foolish one...again especially for the same exact products. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends...just don't do it at AJ's fine foods.I've been here on previous occasions, not sure why I never wrote a rvw previously - maybe because each time was just not memorable.  This one was - and not in a good way.

The funny thing is, we had just attended a Yelp event @ P.I.G. and I really wanted a nice glass of wine, so I was wearing my name tag with Yelp on it (Ooops).  When the Bar Staff saw it, I took it off right away - BUT don't you think that may have prompted a little bit of nice or prompt service, just a tad????

Nope.  
Poor guy next to us had been visiting on a reg. basis many, many times and could not believe how bad the service was this nite.  We each had our bill sit, with our credit cards in full view, for 30 mins when we had to ask the server to ring us out - much to her dismay at being pulled way from her current task at hand: polishing that one glass for over 20 mins.  He also mentioned he always obtained comp. potato crisps, which I saw all around us, but none were offered in our direction?

During that time, we saw a group of 6 business men come in, sit down in the lounge chairs and never get an acknowledgment, greeting, menu, or service.  We're talking $100 just for 1 round of drinks here!  1 had to approach the bar and ask for a server, and ours practically rolled her eyes and muttered someone will be over shortly.  Let me tell you, this place was far from busy!  Everyone shot out at the stroke of HH ending like crazy so it was pretty empty by this time.

I see no reason to ever return - at all.Remember Black Angus?  I think their theme could be described as Casual Dining Steakhouse.  That's The Keg.  Problem is, with the price of steaks it's pretty much impossible to pull off that concept.  Personally, I want a well executed dining experience when spending in the $25+ per plate range.  That can't happen with sloppily dressed teenage greeters and undertrained servers.  

I have great admiration for good tattoo art, but the really bad tattoo staring at me from about a 12-inch square piece of exposed skin on the greeter's back didn't do a whole lot to whet my appetite as she led us to our table.  Now before you write this comment off to my fuddy-duddyness, it was the tattooed 20-somethings in our group that pointed the big bad tattoo out to me in not so complimentary fashion.  

The rest of the experience was also handled by seemingly underqualified people.  Server had to leave twice during ordering to get our questions answered.  Obviously wrong plates were brought to our table (where's the QC at the food window?).  A free dessert was brought to the table, but the guest of honor couldn't eat it because of a food restriction.  The server disappeared into thin air without asking if the many other people at the table might want another dessert, let alone the guest of honor.  Or how about this - tell the guest of honor they have a free dessert coming and what would they like?  It took several minutes to flag said server down again and place a more appropriate dessert order for the guest of honor, for which we would gladly pay.  The rest of us split the free one.

I will say the place was busy, though.  Sure wish they took reservations.  But I never saw so many trucker hats and wife beater shirts paying $25+ per plate in my life.  Even in Black Angus back in the day.  Because of all the plate snafus, our bill ended up being cheap.  Nevertheless, the experience kind of messed up our special occasion.  I can't help comparing this dinner to the great meals I could have gotten elsewhere for the same price, so will stick to those places that execute dinner so much better.I don't get it. The food is very average. The garlic toast is greasy and kid food. The bacon wrapped scallops are laughable in size, presentation and taste. The steaks are grocery store quality. What's the big deal about a twice baked potato? Nothing special. Nothing at all. Oh, and they cooked my medium rare steak to medium well. It's a glorified Sizzler without the salad bar which I would have welcomed over the wedge salad which was served only with bacon bits and not great, SIsco food service blue cheese dressing. Yuk. It ain't cheap either.Eh, ok so this hotel is one of the few in Scottsdale which accept pets so I thought I'd give this hotel a try.  Great location.  Very central.  Assuming it would be a rather easy stay as I am traveling on business and will be out of the room from 8-5 (I own the company, so I bring my dog into my office during the day as well).  

I have to say...it may be because I have a "dog room" but the room is no bueno.  There are scuffs all over & just plain dirty walls.  The "touch up paint" clearly didn't match and makes it look even more cheap.  The Carpet is a dark green color yet you can clearly see stains all over it.  II mean every 6 inches.  I'm grossed out walking on bare feet....haven't taken my flip-flops off other then in bed.  The office chair upholstery is pretty nasty as well.  Having a refrigerator in AZ is a must...IF it actually worked.  My very weak fridge forced me to hit a gas station, buy a cheap cooler and a bag of ice just to keep my water cold.  Slightly below room temp is all your getting out of their current appliance.  

Wood furnishings are nice, linens as well.  But the cleanliness is seriously, seriously lacking.On a Sunday in August, I went to shop and consign at the My Sister's Closet on Scottsdale Road. This chain of stores, to me, is and always will be the best luxury clothing/accessories consignment store.

Unfortunately, tonight I had the absolute worst customer service experience in my entire life. I am not exagerating. By no means am I a diffifult or picky customer - I've done this job myself in college and understand the dynamics. But, until today, I have never come in contact with such rude, unpolite employees.

Each and every employee - from the manager to the cashiers to dressing room assistant - were disrespectful from the time I walked in to the minute I walked out. An employee even insulted me to my face as I walked out the door. I couldn't believe it!

Basically, I came at 5pm (not realizing they close at 6pm) and dropped some clothes off to consign. The girl at the counter told me I had plenty of time to shop and to check back with her when I was done. After browsing 5-6 different racks in about 30 minutes, the manager came up to me and said sharply, "We close in 5 minutes." and immeditely walks away. I was in awe at how unprofessional she acted. Why on earth wouldn't a manager let customers know 15 minutes before close? A loud speaker would have been a good idea.

Following this lovely interaction, I hurry along to the dressing room with about 15 items in tow. As soon as I get my ticket, the assistant turns the lights out in the dressing room! I hear serveral people having trouble trying to make their final choices. This goes on as multiple employees sit and watch the poor women try to tell the difference between what they wanted and what they didn't. Seriously? Wow.

So, here I am trying clothing on in a very dark room, squiting my eyes as I try to decide what I like. I didn't end up with much.

As if this whole experience wasn't already awesome enough, the dressing room assistant couldn't have cared less about the confusion with the lighting. Instead, she decided to continutally knock on my door to ask for items I didn't want so she could return them to the rack. Not a problem, but I think this could have gone quicker if she didn't check on me 12 separate times without even offering assistance.

I consign with My Sister's all the time - the attic, well-suited, as well as the children's store. I visit different locations at least 4-5x a month. In general, I love these stores--they have great prices on quality items and it keeps my closet fresh and stylish without breaking the bank. But, all in all, the customer service needs some serious revamping. I will never shop this location again.Allow me to start out by saying I never thought I would be the type of person to write an email regarding a dining experience (good or bad). 
     Having said that, the only positive thing I can say about our evening at your restaurant was that the valet guy was very pleasant and friendly. It was a special evening for my girlfriends birthday (I called ahead and pre-ordered flowers for the table). Our drinks took way longer than they should have, the main courses and side dishes were average, the time between clearing our plates and dropping off dessert menu's was at least 15 minutes, and the birthday dessert was far from impressive. I would most certainly have informed a manager but didn't have the opportunity since there was no table check during our meal (isn't this standard at fine dining?). Not to mention I would love to inform you of our incredibly boring server's name but I have no idea what it was since he never introduced himself! I hate to sound so crude but with that beautiful location and relatively pricey per person check average, we expected a little more. 
Perhaps a little less time filming shows for the Food Network and a little more time focusing on the little things that create a memorable experience is in order? Just a thought.I had expected a lot from this restaurant.  The resort is top notch and I had seen Beau MacMillian on the Food Network and was a fan.  I came with four friends and cowokers tonight to sample Elements.  The calimari was absolutely delicious.  The pork belly smaller dish was quite tasty as well.  I had asked the waiter for advice regarding the size of the smaller dishes and had been advised that were all of the size to share so I was disapointed when we had ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings and it turned out that only two potsticker shaped dumplings arrived for our group of five and they were quite chewy and no one cared for them.  The tuna tartare at $19 was okay but not very flavorful.

I had ordered the scallops entree which at $38 was quite disappointing.  One of the scallops was not seared at all and the sauce was icky.    I ate less than half the entree but the servers did not seem to notice this.  The string beans had a delicious sauce but me and my tablemates agreed that the texture left a lot to be desired so most was left uneaten.  

This is the first time that I have spent over $100 on a dinner for one and have left disappointed, Santuary at Camel Back is a beautiful resort but I feel like there is some fine tuning to be done to its restaurant to justify its hype and cost.We had friends visiting from CO, ID & CA, so 7 of us for dinner.  I had never been to Elements, so I was excited to take my friends.  3 out of 7 sevens dinners were wrong, very disappointing at these prices.  One of the steaks was grossly over cooked, we sent it back, didn't see that plate until everyone else was done.  

They offered free desserts, not impressed at all, we won't be back.Beautiful scenery and landscape. Staff was very friendly. 

Hotel room was ok. Double sink was nice. 

Carpet was surprisingly dirty. It left your feet black. Bathroom door was rotting away at the bottom. The food at R Bar was ok. The restaurant prices were high (standard for a resort). However the quality of the food was below average. Therefore the  quality to price ratio was very low. I was not alone in thinking this because I saw another hotel guest send back his $18 salad because as he put it, "this is not an $18 salad." Lastly, I can understand resort fees, however, when no mention of the fee is made at check-in and it just appears on your bill with no explanation, the fee is annoying.Beautiful rooms and views. Room service is awful. The tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt I had to send it back. The room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve, such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.I had written a review when I returned home can't find it on here. The place is pretty but Internet is horrible. Spent every morning trying to get someone to help us get connected even though it was paid. Don't order room service. We did a lot and the staff left our trays there overnight. Was swarmed by birds and their poo was all over table chairs tray. This napped twice I had to return tray clean up poop. Not whAt u want to do at several hundreds dollars a night... Front desk wasn't too concerned....

Don't know if ill would stay there Again.......Like other reviewers, I was extremely disappointed that wi-fi was not included in the standard room price or the $17 / night resort fee - I ended up walking across the street every morning to get a latte at Starbucks and utilized their free wi-fi service.

While the room decor was outdated, it was not obnoxious and the grounds were extremely well maintained and the staff was mostly hospitable; I say mostly because of an encounter with one of their top security officers named Joe. My beau and I were walking to Starbucks (our standard routine each morning) and on our third or fourth morning we passed Joe who asked us in a sharp tone if we had a leash for my dog and if we could put it on her. While this seems like a reasonable request I admit I was offended and here is why: my dog is a 14 year old heavyset chihuahua service dog who obeys verbal commands. It was also before 7:00 in the morning and he was the only person we passed that morning, on average, we passed only one other person on the grounds each morning; the resort was only at 15% occupancy. While the resort has rules and the city has a leash law, there are always exceptions - always. While walking the dog on a city street outside of the resort, a police officer passed us and did not stop to tell us to leash the dog - likely because the officer was able to assess that the dog was harmless. During our six night stay at the resort, Joe was the only one who disapproved of our unleashed dog, no other staff minded. Sure, it may be Joe's job to enforce the resort rules, but then Joe should also follow the 10 mph speed limit posted for the grounds, which he did not.

One last thing, after speaking with some of the staff, I had the impression that the resort may not have the best employment practices - this bothers me the most. While I cannot confirm the accuracy of the statements made to me and my beau, I would likely think twice before going back to this resort for this reason alone.Grounds are lovely. Pools are nice. Food was decent. Room was, like some have said: meh ! Mini bar is great, the rest of the room as oldish and sad. But the bed was fine. That's what really matters. What happened to us was weird though.... I am surprised and so I'm posting: during the evening while they were watering, I slipped  on the wet sidewalk and slammed my head. Got a concussion. I called the desk to ask about medical help and they were nice enough to call a physician which I paid for. They sent security to that night before the Doc (from outside service) arrived. So the doctor stitched up my lacerations and treated me etc. However, I have to say I was pretty surprised that the hotel never checked back with me. Never seemed interested if I made it through the night !

 The outside doctor called me twice the next day -- Just wondering about my progress. The hotel wasn't interested.  So, it's not terribly important, but it's not your warm and friendly place, that's for sure.A glorified motel.  Horribly outdated, shabby, can hear neighbors, loud wall unit a/c.  I travel for work and this is the worst hotel I've stayed in for awhile.  Will say the staff was friendly though.Yeah sure they make fresh quacamole at your table, but it's not very good. Same goes for the rest of the food. I've had better food at the roadside in Rocky Point. Their margaritas are flavorless and weak. The chips are bland and dry and their salsa is very American. The food is edible, but I don't think this place can qualify as mexican.

I don't eat beans, so I can't comment on the quality of theirs - they looked disgusting though (like all beans do). I had some soft tacos - it came as 3 tiny tacos with some flavorless bits of steak and cheese inside. The plate was covered in a mountain of rice and junk. Meh. I had 3 margaritas and couldn't even draw a buzz.

I'm surprised this place stays in business. Macayo's and Z Tejas and other chains are much better and they shouldn't be. I don't eat fast food anymore, but I'd seriously rather eat Taco Bell. 

The people I ate with seemed to enjoy their meal, but they aren't very picky.The waitress Gigi was amazing,  The hostess Lucy was wonderful.  The food was fine, just overpriced.  If you like paying a lot more money than you would have to at 20 other restaurants in the area, it's very nice.   Just fyi,  it's mostly an older crowd.  LIke 70 older, not 50 older like we are.Take a pass on the Marinated Flank Steak if it catches your eye, and go with something you know know you like, or that they can't screw up.  The slices were very thick, and my jaw still hurts from chewing.  I tried each of the 4 slices they dealt me, and couldn't get through a one.  Worse yet, the waiter didn't say a thing about it, which at that price, should've been a red flag for him.  I devoured the black beans and fries that were served alongside because I arrived hungry, built up by its rave reviews.  Everyone else in my party seemed satisfied, although my wife hardly touched her rice.  My parents like the place, and I would probably try it again, but I'll stay away from trying to treat myself to anything I think should be worth what they're charging, and have something that won't leave me disappointed.  Fine decor, fine folks, but not the fine dining they lead you to believe.  Typical Phoenix Phony.Have to agree with Katie L.  Unimpressive.

Water and bread was served immediately.  Nice, except the bread was mushy sliced stuff - not a nice crusty loaf one might expect from an Italian restaurant.  Then, we waited for at least 10 - 15 minutes for our server; again, not quite sure which of the two it was, only to realize it was the same one who greeted and served the couple next to us who had been seated after us.    

Ordered the stuffed mushrooms; a little soggy and overly-loaded with tomatoes.  Entree: stuffed shells would have been much much better with 1/4 of the sauce in which it was swimming.  Overall, disappointing.We visited this restuarant on a saturday night, which it was empty, and we used the travelzoo coupon for a three course meal for 40 dollars. This was a great deal since we got two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts but it was way too much food for two people and the coupon was maxed out at about 90 dollars although the total of our food only came to around 65 bucks so it was odd that we had to tip on that amount. The young women who was our waitress was lucky she got a tip at all, she gave us was the worst service we had ever had. First, she was dressed ridicuolously innapropriate for the ambience in a school girl skirt and t shirt, she took our coupon rudely made a face and never asked us for drinks or came back to our table for that matter. she took our order after being impatient and then all the hosts brought our food out, she never asked us for fresh cheese which was offered to other tables. We were so thirsty and she never offered us anything besides the wine which was included, we didn;t drink it but she refused to get us anything else and then dessert came and another host asked us what we wanted. I would have understood if it was busy but we watched her flirt with the bartender all night and then had to over tip her on our price of food, my boyfriend wanted to walk out. I know we had a good deal and the food came out looking lovely. The food and presentation were good but I prefer more authentic italian food but I could never recommend it due to this experience. On another note, all the other workers were lovely.Took the wife out for her birthday, decided on the Cove.  Nice interior, pleasant and friendly staff.  Problem with being understaffed with only 2 people waiting on tables and a fairly good crowd for a Sunday evening.  Long waits, multiple times.  The bread brought to the table was quite mediocre, but the red pepper dip was flavorful and outstanding.  This started the problem, as we had a very flavorful item followed by totally bland food with little character or taste. We ordered the pork chop with polenta, the meat was rather tough and chewy, the vegetables were broccoli (overcooked) carrots (undercooked) but the polenta was tasty and perfect.  The chicken saltimboca had little taste, accompanied by overcooked penne pasta, the sauce tasted like plain canned tomatoes unseasoned, just plain unpleasant.  The chicken was tasty but somewhat overcooked and almost burned on the bottom.  We ordered a bottle of Reisling German wine which was slightly tart instead of slightly sweet.  Fortunately it was half price at $15 instead of $30, but the ice water placed on the table was good.  A very sad experience indeed, need to take the wife out again to make up for this very sub-par meal!This would be our 3rd time visiting Cove Trattoria.  The first 2 were exceptional.  Both times we went on a Friday night, so one would expect it to be busy - it was not.  Service was fine, food was great.  This is why we went for a 3rd time.  

Big mistake.  We went last Thursday and it was quite busy, but there were several tables available.  We were asked if we had a reservation of which we did not being that the last 2 times, it was empty.  We were told that the 2 tops around the bar were not open seating (which must have changed because they were before).  So, we waited for 10 minutes or so only to be seated with the menus to have to wait 10 minutes for a drink order.  Worst part is two "regulars" came in, sat themselves at the same 2-tops we were sitting at and got prompt attention.  Still no waitress at our table.  When we finally did get a waitress, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and weren't lucky enough to get the same bread our neighbors got.  Again, after ordering our food, we waited approx. 30 minutes to receive it!  Luckily our food was fine and we didn't need anything because our waitress never bothered to check on us.  

I am positive the regulars get great service based on what I witnessed, but looking at all the other sad folks around the restaurant, their experience was similar to ours.  

Good thing we had a Groupon to use because I would've been even more upset had we paid full price for the so-so food and horrible service.Patio was nice but that was it...service was slow (the woman was very nice when we saw her). Service and food made me think of being in a hammock. Relax, swaety, bored and somewhat comfortable.It's ok. Ambience is great, exceptional actually.  Service tried hard so that counts. Food is hit or miss. Some was great some was inedible. All in all, seems the place caters to out of towners more into the experience than the food, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just not our cup of tea, for 75-100 per person we go for the food.Nah....not quite on par with other interval international properties as far as the room and amenities but if you just need a place to crash with a kitchen, this will do nicely.   Beds are visibly sunken in and in need of replacement so sleep was rough.  During off peak, you can get 7 nights for $229 .  Can't beat that.This is a good place to get FAT and POOR. 

I came here for the first time in about 15 years because my mom said we could get in for free. They have actual sets from movies like Wild Wild West and the Rifleman. Good photo ops. 

However, I'm not sure anybody would want to pay to get in unless you're Canadian or from back East. There's not a lot to do. By waiting an hour for a stagecoach ride I missed the gunfight. It wouldn't happen again for two hours. They have burro rides. Ugh. A children's rock climbing wall that only goes 40 feet high. Whatever. 

The whole town is basically shops and restaurants. You can pay big bucks for a straw hat (yeahh!), for western toys like trains or you can go to a restaurant and pay $20 for a steak and potatoes (yee ha!) If you want ice cream, it's at least $3 and the person that takes your order barely speaks English. A burger is $6. I don't know what the admission price is for the "privilege" of going here.Seems like man agent needs to shake things up.  We ate there sat. Night, very crowded, food good for price. Went back with another couple Sunday, and it was totally different. Not crowded, no wait for a table. The waitress informed us of the things they were" out of" at 7 pm on Sunday. Several entree choices and no more baked potatoes. So we ordered around that and the mgr came out and apologized for the screw ups and said that now they were out of mashed potatoes too and he was embarrassed that this was happening. So we opted for a different side. Food was pretty good, but it took an hour to get it. Our waitress would leave to get the answer to a question,( is there still meat for a French dip) and it took her 15 mins to retun.  The fastest service we got was when we received our bill. Sorry won't be back.The food was bland, the lamb was hard to chew and full of fat and the vegetables had very little flavor. We were looking forward to eating here but were totally disappointed. I do not recommend it. The best part was the rice.Food was great, but HORRIBLE service!
Walked in the door, I wasn't even acknowledged for the first 5 minutes. Hostess was on the phone. Didn't even say "hi" or "be with you in a minute" I just stood there until 1 of the waiters finally sat me down.  I'm not gonna get into details. Just work on your service.I keep going back to Papago, hoping my dining experience will change. Mainly because I LOVE the Orange Blossom and their pizza.

Each time is the same. I walk in and sit down, wait, then wait some more. Even though the place is filled, the wait staff can be found standing and talking to each other behind the bar. I witness the people next to us go to the bar for a beer because they were tired of waiting for someone to take their order. Last time I checked, this place was not self-serve. 

Just last week my husband and I decided to try Papago one last time. This time our strategy was to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for someone to take our order. The bartender behind the bar was nice. He served our drinks quickly. 

However, what we observed while we sat at the bar made me never want to step foot in this establishment again. The bartender was arguing with a young waitress about food that was sitting in the kitchen. Her response, "I didn't know where it went so I left it there." The place is small, I'm sure she could have figured it out. There was another girl working that must have been her buddy. The bartender, who I assume was in charge, was getting on them (probably for being worthless). They were rolling their eyes when he looked away and had bad attitudes. While sitting at the bar, we watched at least ten customers have to come up and order their drink. While the waitresses stood talking and complaining. 

I told my husband, "If I owned this place and saw the slow, poor service, along with how many customers had to go to the bar for service, I would be embarrassed!" Come to find out, the owner had been sitting behind us the entire night. It amazes me how he could be in his own restaurant and be completely oblivious to the poor customer service.  

I would much rather go out of my way and go to Four Peaks. Maybe one day Papago Brewery will hire a pleasant, efficient wait staff.I was really hoping to enjoy this brewery more than I did. I think with such high reviews, I had high expectations of what I would find. 

As another post says its not "Four Peaks" and I'm assuming they are referring to the appearance and ambiance of the place. It came off really divvy and deteriorated to me with a dirty bar top and messy floors. The bathrooms were awful like something out of a truck stop and there was a complaint about the women's restroom overflowing while I was sitting at the bar. The bar keep just kind of shrugged it off in acknowledgment and did nothing. She didn't do much of anything in terms of explaining the place or the beer selection after asking about what was available. 

It was completely dead on a Monday afternoon at happy hour so I can't speak much for how loud it gets. They did have a good beer selection on tap, so that is their obvious pull for people. Can't speak on their food is as I left after my second beer, just couldn't stomach the place after poor service and crappy atmosphere. 

I like a dive just as much as the next trendy hipster with a mustache but when the service is lousy, decor is boring, and things are a bit pricey. its time to move on to the next one.Beer Selection 10/10 however service is 1/10. Staff lacks product knowledge. Specials are not mentioned. Wait time is long. Staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.I give it a 2.5. I was enjoying my day off by doing errands and paying bills when hunger pangs struck. I must have been hungry because I decided to try a new Chinese buffet. As a Chinese buffet this one is at best very average. The food is spiced to their clientele( I was the only Asian in the joint that was not serving) so you know it was middle of the road. They did have a larger and more diverse selection that I expected. The selection of hot fish and shrimp dishes were more than normal. They also had dishes I did not expect there like tortilla chips, shrimp salsa and rice krispy treats w/ fruit loops in them. I liked those. Unfortunately there was not really anything else I could get excited about. Like I said average at most.This is not to bash anyone. To be honest I really like Vi Vi, she ALWAYS remembers me and talks to me on a personal level, and she is very patient. But no amount of niceness in the world can make that wait bearable. I went in on Friday the 21 of December, I waited 40 minutes JUST to be seated. I remember she said come early because they are usually busy in the evening, well it worked perfect because I was heading to San Diego that evening. I went in around 2:09 PM, I was greeted by her husband. (Vi was in the back) he told me it would be a 20-30 minute wait which was an obvious lie. Another person came in right after me he told her a 30-40 minute wait. Little did I know that wait time was for me. They pass up A LOT of business people won'[t wait. And I personally don't blame them. To top it off because there is a wait they aren't through at all but have no problem charging me 65 bucks for a pedicure, and full set. I don't have any problem playing for good service but this service could be a LOT better. I have been going here for about three months, and I always tip. I am not a bad customer but for the money I pay I expect a lot more. 

My advice find another place? I promise you won't regret it.5 Stars for the delicious food & flavors. 

No stars for the tired, drab & dusty interior. Very disappointed. Needs a complete interior update overhaul and face lift. 

The food is great quality, but their portions are monumental, and rather unappetizing with the amount of food on the plate--although this could be appealing to others of a unsophisticated palette. 

Quite disappointed, but gracious that the quality of meat was outstanding.I would recommend many other gyms over this one.

Aside from a few passionate (and really great) spin instructors, the classes are average at best.  There are two good trainers that I have worked with who are extremely knowledgable.  Otherwise it sounds like a majority of the trainers aren't certified and are just "fit" people.

The front desk staff is a joke.  I hate to be so abrasive, but I am pretty sure the requirements to work the front desk are having a pulse and the ability to swipe a key fob.  Aside from a majority of them having terrible personalities, they are totally clueless on basic manners and customer service. I could write a long list, but my most recent experience was that I recently called a handful of times to cancel my membership.  Each time I was aksed to leave my information. Following no returned calls I explained to the front desk girl my frustration and her response was "well, you will just have to keep calling.  It is not like they can drop what they are doing and talk to you about your membership."  Really?  Because when I wanted to join a year ago I received 11 phone calls in one week.  (Yep, that I 1.57 times per day they had enough time to drop everything and call me when they wanted my business.)

The gym is generally clean.  There are always a decent number of cardio machines that are flagged as down for maintenance.  

Best time of day to go is the morning.  People mind their own business and get a solid workout in.  Later in the day you have a crowd made up of a majority of people showing way too much skin, looking to take someone home or blowing kissing in the mirror at themselves as they do bicep curls.Divey pub with a decent atmosphere.  A little too smokey for my taste and the beer selection on tap is nothing to brag about.  The crowd was a combination of skater types and preppy types.  It was interesting but not that exciting.Meh!When gramps said we (me, him and dad) were going here on Christmas Day, I spent the past four days despairing the idea. Seeing a year's worth of 1-star reviews didn't help my negative attitude going into this festive meal, either. I was fully planning on adding my own snarky one-star review to this place after I vomited up whatever I happened to ingest here, however I'm giving as optimistic of a two-star review as I can.

First off, don't kid yourself. The food is as bad as all the reviews here say. They did have some decent turkey they were slicing up, though, and i had some rice that appeared to be the only side item not swimming in goo. 

And yes, the bathrooms are as disgusting as other reviewers have mentioned. Nearly the entire men's room floor was wet and there were no less than three wet floor signs in there. Hazmat suit recommended.

However, I bumped this to a 2 - more like a 2.5 - because the poor Christmas-day staff was straight busting ass to keep the overflowing crowd stuffed full of breaded cardboard-like substances, and they were doing a fine job of reaching that goal. The manager was being as nice as he could to his employees while they were all no doubt pretty bummed out about constantly refilling the buffet trays for thankless guests on Christmas day. The other staff members were also doing the best they could to pretend to be happy around the guests. So for their effort and their ability to grin-and-bear it with the best of them, I just couldn't give them a one-star review.Take Three on the breakfast prego craving.  

Since I was already on McDowell and work in Old Town Scottsdale...I decided to drive over the hill and hit up this Jack In The Box.  

I order at the drive-thru this morning a small Strawberry Banana Smoothie.  "That will be $3.xx, please pull up to the window."   SWEET!!!  I'm getting my breakfast smoothie!!   

I get to the window and am told.  Its not ready.  It will be in 15 minutes.  I say thanks and drive off .  SERIOUSLY!??!

Again, you'd think that with a 24hr drive-thru operation that they'd have an item ready that would more likely than not, be consumed during breakfast hours!!

Must be a company policy or something to not have the smoothie machines up, running, and ready to go before 6am.   Jack - You SUCK!Maybe I'm the fool but I still don't see what the any of the talk is about the Salt Cellar.  Mind you, I'm not comparing it to other seafood restaurants in the valley.  I'm comparing it to other seafood restaurants period.  

There is nothing about the Salt Cellar that have ever stood out for me, except the price and I don't find this place worth the cost.  I'd go elsewhere.Overpriced, mediocre food in an ice-cold environment.  

I really wanted to like this place - old style, non-pretentious environment ('the un-scottsdale'). But alas, it was freezing cold inside (in November, when I went - wasn't even that hot outside, so why the A/C had to be on full blast is beyond me. 

Both our dishes were just ok ... not worthy of the price. Has a clearly loyal, regular crowd, which is nice - definitely a 'well known' secret.  But I won't be back.ATTENTION DIFFERENT LOCATIONS CHARGE DIFFERENT PRICES AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE SAME ITEMS ! i saw this when I wanted to exchange 4 items at the Scottsdale Rd store. I was told prices are based on zip codes. The amazing part the higher prices are areas see as lower income areas on items of need not luxury .Dear audience,  being psychic myself I truly enjoy a personalized reading and feel it is a true treat I can gift myself when I feel stressed out.  I had the chance of speaking with some very accurate readers here at this store and some readers who were only good with card readings.  I am using this forum mostly to complain about one reader who used to be a favorite of mine for over a year until she felt she was fail proof and said something completely out of character with my best friend that was simply untrue.
Lisa Jo had warned me about a few people in my immediate circle of friends and my business associates but sometimes I felt her readings were a bit hysterical simply to keep me enthralled so I would feel a need to continue on with the reading (and hence pay a bit more than I intended).
Don't get me wrong.  Lisa Jo came across as being very sincere in her efforts to watch out for my best interests but as time went on I felt the readings were continuing on a negative path making me leaving the conversation a bit paranoid and confused.  One day I corrected Lisa Jo and told her something she said was completely off so she got very disturbed on the phone and rather than apologize to me she became haughty and angry that I would challenge her thought and make note of something that was incorrect in her analysis.  On a whole I felt her readings could give me insight but the fact that she refused to see my viewpoint and seemed to think she is infallible and correct 100 percent of the time is a cause of concern.  As a psychic healer myself I sometimes get an incorrect perception and I always welcome constructive criticisms so I can enhance my abilities as a healer; but the fact that Lisa Jo is unwilling to grow and truly re examine a reading as perhaps being a bit inaccurate is a clear sign that Vision Quest might have a need for better customer relations since phone readings and in store readings can be expensive.   A couple of weeks ago I requested a reading with Lisa Jo despite our disagreement but I was refused and even though  I wanted to share with Lisa Jo that indeed she was wrong but that part of her other reading did indeed come true I was encouraged to speak to another reader rather than Lisa Jo and not given the opportunity to let Lisa Jo what had happened during a crisis situation.  Psychics are just ordinary people with a gift and sometimes if that gift is abused we can lose our ability to really connect with Source and our readings might not be as accurate or as healing as we would like.  I think Lisa Jo needs to take her ego in check and I think Vision Quest should do a better job of customer service relations so as not to hurt the general public or allow their readers to abuse customers at their whim.Molly Maids is pretty hit or miss for a cleaning service. We used them awhile back and they did a pretty good job aside from missing some little things, then we used them a few months ago and they missed some big things such as DUSTING. Considering they send two housekeepers out to the house, I was pretty disappointed.  And they charged us for 2.5 hours for cleaning a small townhome. Seems a little long to me for such a small place.Wontons were mush, and tasted terrible.  The rest of the Wor Wonton soup was really good however.  Wierd.  The King Triple Delight was just so-so.   Very average, not great flavor, but not bad.  Other than the inedible wontons in the wonton soup, just a meh rating from me.  They were nice, but I won't return.I would not recommend this place. I went in recently for a fill on my acrylics. They don't have the best color selection, the fill took almost 2 hours and within 2 days 2 of the nails had broken!Service was slow, and the server had a slight attitude the entire night. We had 7 people at a large table in the center of the restaurant, and had brought in four bottles of wine purchased from the place next door. Every course took at 30-45 minutes to bring out, which was fine because we were happy and celebrating. Dishes were brought out a couple at a time, with a few minutes in between. I ordered a drink twice, which was really not a big deal. The server however was impatient when we couldn't decide on things immediately, or that my sister asked about the cheese that came on the steak. She and her husband keep kosher... she didn't need to explain herself, but he was not very accommodating. She also asked for some bread that didn't touch the pork on the charcuterie plate. She was brought a plate of 4 bite size slices.

I didn't have too many issues with this restaurant until the bill came. The food had been rich and good. My dad, who *never* makes a stink about price discrepancies, pointed out to the waiter that he thought the corkage fee was waived if you purchased the wine next door. The waiter said no, that's not true. My dad pulled up the Zagat's review where it says that, word for word. We just had 7 people eating 3-4 courses each, and you can't waive the corkage fee for 4 bottles?? A customer service-oriented person would have apologized for the confusion and waived the fee. A somewhat customer service-savvy person would have apologized and waived half the fee. This server said "Yeah, we've been trying to get Zagat's to take that out for a long time. It's wrong."

Decent food, but don't expect service to be on par with the prices.Upon hearing about Facebook postings concerning the  bartender that has worked here for over 7 years I decided to take some action. This guy is an idiot who is always trying to impress the entire little restauant with his drinks he makes up. Being a small place everyone has to listen while he rants about his skills. 
THE WARNING HERE IS HE SERVES  MINORS ON PURPOSE! He seems to cater to the younger crowd....under 21! Kinda creepy!
I WATCHED AS A COUPLE OF YOUNGER GUYS WALKED IN AND WERE NOT CARDED BUT INSTEAD GIVEN SAMPLES OF THESE "SPECIAL" DRINKS.

It is ashame because the food is good both lunch and dinner.I visited this restaurant today and the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the customer service was great! The waitress/bartender was awesome.. 

I usually order beef and broccoli when I try a new Chinese restaurant because I figure you can't get anymore basic then that, but it was really bad.. Not enough seasoning and too many water chestnuts.. There was no flavor to the sauce.. And the beef didn't even resemble beef anymore.. The consistency was slimy and weird. 
I would not recommend this place.
Oh and it wasn't cheap for the quality I received!I kind of think this place is highly overrated.

It pisses me off because coming from Jersey this place is kind of weak.  Like others have stated the service is very slow and everytime I order hard Salami it is this little thinly sliced salami and I have never had it in any other Italian deli.  Not so good.

They do however sell jars of Centos products and I love the olive oil, cherry peppers, and pepperocinis so I will give them their due.

Go for the products, but if you want a sub sandwich go down the street to Jersey Mikes.Service is really slow. It took them 20-30 minutes just to take my order, and I was standing right by the register for to-go orders. They acknowledged me, but couldn't send anyone to help me. 

I ordered a whole cheese steak and a whole meatball sub expecting two giant sandwiches but seemed to get 2 separate half sandwiches each at around 4 inches long. You could tell they made them separately since the meat tapered at both ends of each piece. 

I was seriously disappointed at the size of these sandwiches for the price. I can't imagine spending $5 for one of these half sandwiches. They weren't even that stuffed full and the baguette wasn't very crisp, bordering on slightly stale. The take out box they gave me looked almost half empty with the sandwiches in there too.

The flavor of the meat  wasn't too bad though. The mushrooms were nice and the cheese sauce was really good too. It actually reminded me a lot of  the Uncle Sam's that used to be by my house. Better quality here, but I feel like I enjoyed the Uncle Sam's cheese steak more.

The meatball sub wasn't anything special to me either.

Not sure I'd ever really come back.This place used to be good and I was disappointed the last time I went. Soggy fried rice, the waitress didn't ask us how the food is, I hope they shape up.Came here for lunch buffet once. The buffet is not worth it. Theres so little food in their buffet it doesn't deserve to be called a buffet. Its tastes okay, but go elsewhere if your looking for a real chinese buffet.Fair prices, odd hours.  Cats everywhere. I won't be coming back. I came to pick up my car and nobody was there... Door was locked. Nobody answered my calls. I had to call out of work for the day.Maybe it's because this location is on Mill Avenue, but I've had better. The sushi is average, the prices are higher than normal, and the service is poor.

We called ahead to schedule a larger group and the hostess told us she "didn't accept reservations" but that she'd consider it. Ummmm, okay? When we arrived, we still had to wait 20+ minutes for them to prepare the table. Drinks were slow to arrive and poor lighting outside made it awkward to order.

When the food arrived, it was simply lacking. For an upscale sushi joint, I expected to be blown away -- I was far from impressed.

When we were ready to leave, it took 25 minutes for the waiter to bring our check. TWENTY FIVE! A man in our party finally had to hunt him down in order for us to pay and leave.

All in all, I won't return.I have been twice, both at lunchtime. Cute (trendy) place, sushi rolls are decent, not spectacular. Loved sitting out on the patio; however, there was a distinct smell of sewage wafting by every once in a while. Not sure where that was coming from. 

The hostesses were unfriendly. Waitresses were nice enough, but wow, S L O W service.  I mean, my God. I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there (which may account for my belief that the sushi was good, lol!). Same embarrassingly slow service in getting our check to leave.

Overpriced for a lunch menu, I thought, and the calamari appetizer was a huge disappointment. It was like ... TGI Fridays or something. Just very ... sportsbar-esque. Huge, rectangular chunks of calamari, heavily battered and deep fried. What happened to light tempura and calamari rings? Isn't this a Japanese restaurant?

All in all, it was okay. I was in good company both times, and had plenty of time to spend, so the slow service was not an issue, but it could be a problem if you have other plans. I will likely go back until I am able to find a comparable or better sushi place - I'm new to Arizona.This place is dirty, the carpet and the tables smell like they've been soaked in beer for years.  The other locations are very clean and pleasant compared to this one.Stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  I had never been to Four Peaks before but have driven by it and seen how busy and opted to go somewhere else due to lack of parking.  We were lucky to have found a spot about a block away so we decided to check out the place.  It was a hot muggy day and we thought some nice cold beers would hit the spot.  We arrived at the front of the place to see about five people standing around at the hostess spot, not one of them said Hi.  I had to say two please and interrupt their conversation.  We got seated in the back and right away the heat just hit me when I sat down.  I started sweating.  No ac, really?  We are in phoenix and people still use swamp coolers?  Anyways I was uncomfortable and noticed everyone was sweating, like beast. I looked around and saw a lot of college students sitting about and thought to myself... geez this isn't where I would go to pick up on someone, everyone is sweating and looks gross.  
I know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me.  I love four peaks beers normally, but when my server came with my beer it was warm, not refreshing when sitting and sweating.  Food was average, typical bar food.
Our server was ok for it being so busy, but I didn't get the warm and fuzzies with her attitude. Wonder if this review will be axed by yelp?? hmm..Service is iffy. Sometimes I get a great waitress, sometimes a terrible one. The beer is great but the food is overpriced and some dishes are really not good. My friend had to spit out the calamari. I thought the quesadilla was gross (had the taste of processed cheese). 

Some dishes are good though. Burgers are good, the beer bread is great. Their pork and bean dish is very good (but the beans are bland).

And the parking situation, oh lord, don't get me started. Prepare to park 1/2 a mile away on the street. Seriously. And turn in your side view mirror or some drunk college student will break it off.I think that this is basically your typical brewery restaurant ... nothing special that can be raved about. I'm not much into beer but have tried a few from their selection - the Hefeweizen & Sunbru are two I've liked. As far as the food goes, after going there a couple of times now and having tried a burger, some of their appetizers, and the fish & chips, I'd have to stay that if I go back, I'll stick to the fish & chips! I tried the popper burger made which chicken breast & it was extremely huge & messy/hard to eat. The fried onions were really oily & the chicken wasn't grilled well so it ended up being really dry. Their nachos & spinach artichoke dip aren't bad.

Keep in mind that at this location, parking is a little bit of a pain. They don't have much of a private parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. Plan on taking a little bit of walk to the restaurant because it's almost always ridiculously busy. Additionally, if you're going there as a group, they don't take reservations and require at least half of your party to be there before you can be added to their list to get a table. Even though they're busy, I do have to note that every time I've been there, the service was good and they were accommodating and offered to do separate checks if we wanted.I really love 4 Peaks beer. Also love the Tasting Room. Therefore, 2 stars. Unfortunately, the 8th St location sucks. Would give it zero. Showed up today to do a girls night with 7 ladies. So I didn't realize it would be a bastion for soccer hooligans during the World Cup. Actually my bad, I really didn't think about it. However, when I got there ahead of time to get a table, it was only me. They said they wouldn't seat me until most of our party was there. Of course, it's 120 degrees out so... I asked where I could wait. The bar. Bummer, the bar was shoulder to shoulder. I literally couldn't even enter the doorway. So, I asked if I could grab a table to wait. Nope. I had to sit outside with the fiery sun torturing my delicate Irish skin. Want to know why they get a bad review? THERE WERE 20 OPEN TABLES AND NO ONE IN LINE. That's right. They made me sit outside in the sun instead of letting me sit at any of the numerous open tables. I promptly took our business to Casey Moore's. Never returning to Four Peaks. I don't even know if I want my beloved Kiltlifter anymore.Disgusting food. Good service.  I have tried Z'Tejas twice and will never try it again.I ordered a salad with a variety of melons and grilled shrimp.  The shrimp was chewy, hard and terrible.  The rest of the salad was great but that was a huge turn off.  They did, however, have the best skinny margarita I've ever had.I don't know why people hype this place so much.

The bread is usually stale. 

Just because they blantently propagandize herb doesn't make it good.  Subway is just as legit. 

Plus it's a bit dirty.  What do you expect from an entirely baked work force.  If you find yourself in the vicinity of cheba hut, go to the Pasty.A friend of mine visiting from California stayed here one weekend.  I went to pick him up at his hotel room.  It was the first time I've been to a Red Roof Inn and I wasn't impressed.  The room was large, but it wasn't well appointed and very bland.   The elevator didn't work very well, it "stuttered" and gave me a sense that you could get stuck between floors....not saying that it would do that, but it gave me that uneasy feeling.

I asked him why he selected this place and he said it was because it was cheap.  He didn't like the beds and didn't sleep well.  For the traveler on a budget, it would probably work fine.

Return Factor - 30%What I want to know is who the hell puts sweet relish on a burger? Especially a burger that already has dill pickles.. I mean I love pickles as much as the next asshole, but I fn HATE sweet relish, so it pretty much ruined the whole thing. 

Aside from that, my curly fries were perfect, and they have Cherry Coke.. so here, have 2 stars.Its a fun gimmick but, why would I go back here? Its not like there's a paucity of good burger places around. I realized I could stop when I saw that they just had the same place everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Its kind of depressing, especially after you get all clogged with Fatburger. Seriously, give it up. This place isn't that good, just familiar if you are from the west.I got a pretty decent haircut and with the first time discount 18 dollars for a haircut plus tip for a cut is not too shabby

I had Ryca as my stylist and then get touched up by the owner after she finished

*Update
Eh 3 weeks into my haircut the deficiencies are starting to show
Back and sides are not layered evenly and over a pretty average men's cut

It's disappointing I can get consistent good haircuts in Korea for 10-20 bucks but paying that much in America will be hit or miss 90% of the timeFirst time here was also the last time. I came here for lunch to meet up with my Aunts on a Monday afternoon. The place was pretty packed, but they seemed to be staffed pretty well, however...you wouldn't know that with the service we received.

12:00 (noon) - I walked in and found where my Aunts were sitting. Sat down, was greeted by the waitress immediately and ordered my drink.

12:15 - ordered my $8 mini burger plate with fries.

12:30 - tables around us finished eating and new customers sat down, then ordered.

12:45 - new customers received their food...we were still waiting for ours... 

1:00pm - after several apologies from the waitress, and several trips she took to the kitchen to find out where the hell our food was, we ended up deciding to take the meal to go.

1:15pm - we finally got our meal, to go. Thankfully the waitress said the bill was on them, and apologized for the unusual wait. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars, and not 1, is because the bill was taken care of and we didn't have to pay for an hour long wait with no food. Also, I was tweeting about the service, and the @chilis twitter account wanted details, and tried to help during the last 10-15 minutes there. Oh, the food was decent. It's what you would expect from any other Chili's.Service was slow. Chili's food is bland.To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery. 

First of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time. 

 When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered. 

As a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.

At this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried: 

Beer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a "Cajun roumalade"--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.

Marzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference. 

Steak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach. 

Other people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head. 

For a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price.i'm super conflicted on this review. i joined about 40 others for a surprised party at gordon biersch on saturday night. our party was tucked in the back corner on the east side of the bar. the space had an adjacent patio, which i thought was really cool. until the hostesses started seating guests that were not part of our party on that patio. 

on one hand, service at the bar was most excellent. each time i trotted up i had, within seconds, another light beer was in my hand - that means i have one happy husband, so naturally, i was stoked. bartender was happy to refill my water and give me a fresh lemon wedge (hey someone's got to drive right?!).

on the other hand, i found it odd that the restaurant chose to walk other guests through the party to the patio ... i really felt for those people. our party of 40+ was crammed into a small space to begin with, and on top of that hostesses were leading diners through the crowd to seat them at patio tables. i understand patio = prime seating, but pushing your way through a crowd to get to it isn't appetizing. the party area was so small i couldn't have gotten to the food display if i wanted to - there were way too many people in our small space. if the restaurant had decided to allow our party to use the patio (which only had 4 tables on it to begin with) i think the other diners and our party would have been much more comfortable. 

in my mind, all this comes together as a 2 star review, with no disrespect intended for the fantastic bartender.I come in every 2 weeks. I swear it's a 30 minute wait ever single time. Always a long line here.HIM -- Sound was terrible. The band actually sounded better when heard from the lobby. How do I know this? I had to spend the second half of HIM's set in the lobby because I was banned from the actual "performance space" when I punched some kid who had knocked my mother over while moshing...by himself. Yes, I go to concerts with my mother. She just has this thing for Scandinavian guys. She just loves boys in makeup. That probably explains why she was so enamored with my younger brother. Until I decided I wanted to be a girl. Now we're best buds and my brother hates me. I have family issues.

CKY -- Security got me good on this one. I was like "I'll get by with no problem. I'll leave my wallet chain in my car." Then I get there and they're all like "all that loose change in your pocket? It's gotta go." Um, gotta go where? Certainly not the trash. That would be ridiculous, throwing money away. Oh...I get it...you mean it's gotta go in YOUR POCKET. Well, normally you wouldn't, you know, EXTORT money from a patron, but it's either that or risk me hitting a guy in the face with three dollars worth of quarters and dimes, right? Well, okay, if you say so. If it's really for safety purposes...HEY, I DID NOT JUST SEE YOU BUYING A FUCKING SODA WITH MY FUCKING QUARTERS!

Mindless Self Indulgence/Kill Hannah -- What do you mean 26 dollars a ticket? What? Kill Hannah's not the headliner? We were told it was a Kill Hannah show, not a, who are these jabronis, Mindless Self Indulgence? Oh shit, I said that out loud, huh? Everyone's looking at me funny. Are they famous? Fuck, I'll just buy the ticket anyway. We'll just pretend I'm being facetious. 

Me -- Ashamed as I am to admit it, deep down I dream of playing at the Marquee, so I can know that people loved me enough to put up with these shenanigans to see me make an ass out of myself on stage. There's always hoping.I have been coming to this venue since it  became the Marquee in the mid-late 90's.  It used to be the Red Rive Opry.  I have seen a shit load of shows here over the years.  This place was pretty good, but parking was always a pain, even before they made Tempe Town Lake. They didn't charge you though.

    Any way I went to see Les Claypool last  night.  Instead of charging you $5 to park in the free Tempe public parking, they now  want you to pay $5 go park in the parking structure across the street.  Fuck that, park at Tempe Town lake for free, no matter what the parking Nazis tell you.  Yeh they charge you a $3 fee to purchase you ticket at the window, which is bullshit.  But the Dodge Theater charges $6 wtf!

  Sometime about 5-6 years ago some security asshole decided it was a good idea to strip search you before you go in.  No not really, they just make you take your shoes off and remove all the items from your pockets and pat you down.  This isn't the fucking airport.  This is the only music venue around that I know that does this.  So for a large crowd expect some delays and what a joy if you are wearing boots.

  The mix drinks are generally decent.  As far as drink prices go, they are on par with other venues.  They are way cheaper than the Dodge Theater.  This ain't the Sail Inn.  There is a bar in the lobby area and another small one to the left of the stage.   For some larger shows they usually add another bar or two.  Be sure to drink before you go in.

  The stage stage area reminds me of an older movie theater with the seats ripped out.  The acoustics aren't good, basically 4 concrete wall.  The sound varies from ok to adequate, depending where you are in the room and who's playing.  By the sound board is usually ok.

  Security here is over way over zealous and they are usually assholes who make a mountain out a mole hill.  I really hate this place because of this.  I personally only had a few run ins them over the years, again because they over react.  For example: Last night security was disrupting the show so much to stop people from taking pictures and videos on their cell phones that Les Claypool told security fuck off, he didn't care if they took his picture.

    This venue used to be pretty cool, but the past few years I hate to go to shows here.  I avoid this place unless they have someone I really want to see.  Such shame because I live right down the street.I have a lot of the same things to say.  Celebrity is old but has a nice circular stage and great acoustics.  Dodge is nice and more expensive but a great place to see a concert.  My beef with Marquee has always been that it is a cheap warehouse and it is a bit of a dump.  Seeing a concert at a dump can have value too if it has some history or just a cool ambiance/environment.  Marquee has none of the above.  I will say that the ketel one tonics were stiff and the bartender was responsive.  Otherwise, it's pretty hot because the doors are open and they have a couple of large fans inside and that's about it.  Many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good.  However, the concert we saw this week sounded very good so that was a nice suprise.  I usually go to rock n roll shows if that gives you and idea of the type of music and the volume.  LOUD.  Gotta love it.Drove up from Tucson to catch The Airborne Toxic Event last week. ATE kicked ass, Marquee, not so much. Overpriced, piss warm brews and sound work could have been better. Would I make the trip again to see another kick ass band? Yup, but this place could really be bad ass with a little attention to detail.This place is a ripoff. Baseline price when you purchase a ticket is around $30. Okay, I can live with that. Then there's $15 in service fees, order fees, whatever bullshit name for extra fees. So $45 dollars to see a B-level band. No thanks!Some amazing bands comes to the Marquee, don't get me wrong, but the venue itself is another story. The tickets are WAY overpriced. Upon first glance, they seem affordable, but then there are almost $10 in fees...per ticket. And they're will call only. 

The remodeling is nice, much more open, but this place over serves to the extreme. If someone comes up stumbling drunk and asks for a couple more beers, they get then without question. The last two times I've been there, people have been carried out on stretchers covered in vomit. That's not counting the surrounding people that were by some chance still standing. 

But yet they made me throw out my gum at the door. Right.This place is hit or miss and the late night drunks are not enjoyable either. I have rolled up and seen many cops outside and I am curious as to what is going on for them to be outside a pizza place but it seems they have trouble there from time to time. I think the pizza is so-so, sometimes its pretty good and other times its garbage. I recommend Jamies Pizza and Pita down the street, better service, pizza and its quieter. The only good thing is the Gus's stays open all the time.First - and last - time I will order from this place.  Place the order at 9, got it at 10. Unacceptable.  Delivery driver came without red peppers or Parmesan cheese.  Totally unacceptable.  Pizza is okay, not great but not bad either.  Gave it a 2 rating cause' it's open 24 hours a day, most pizza places are not open at all hours of the night.  Anyway, I delivered pizzas for a couple of years a long time ago.  I was working at Godfather's Pizza in Ahwatukee - at the time it was the ONLY pizza joint in that area and the only one anyone could order delivery.  I ALWAYS carried a bag full of red pepper and Parmesan cheese packets with me.  The delivery guy told me that "you have to order that extra". Whatever.  Other chains do that as well IMO it's a complete joke of a chain/pizza company that apparently thinks that a person should have to order red peppers.  Definitely not anything even close to the taste of Serrano's pizza, Papa John's is also much better and even Barrio's beats them out on taste.  I guess if you're drunk/hungover or high on pot and it's 2 am, a great place to call and have delivery, otherwise, there is definitely better out there.   As the for the Yelper that found metal in their pizza, people sue companies that refuse to respond and often-times win large amounts of money in such cases.Harlow's, you are overrated.  Your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  Your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. The toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.

I do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a Tempe tradition, go to Chompies or Essence.So I keep reading reviews where people say "I want to like whatever place, but I just can't."  This is how I feel about Harlow's.

The inside is cool... I like the retro diner feel.  And it's right around the corner from me, so it would be a great convenient spot.  And the prices are decent, except for the fact that the food is just not good.  (In the end I feel like I just wasted $30 on a crappy meal.)  I've given the place two tries, and I just don't get how the rating is so high and why it's always busy.

The first time I had the eggs benedict.  Not great, but not terrible.  I would never go back for more of that though.  I had read that the eggs Maximilian are the gem on the menu, so when I gave the place another go, I tried it.  Also not good.  My first bite was cold.  Not room temperature cold, but like refrigerator cold.  The flavor is somehow bold and bland at the same time.  I ate about 1/4 of the plate and couldn't do it anymore.  I left the place unsatisfied and kinda hungry.

My boyfriend likes pretty much everything and is NOT a picky eater, but he didn't like his chorizo breakfast burrito.  I don't know how you can mess  up a breakfast burrito, in AZ nonetheless, to the point that the guy won't eat it, but... well, it happened.

The OJ tastes like the stuff you get out of a machine at a hotel breakfast.  

You know you've made a mistake when you know you would have eaten better tasting food at Denny's.  :(

I can't decide between one star or two.  I will never go back there because the food is so bad.  But the service is fine.I'm an avid listener of Jazz and a musician and I'm not too into KJZZ.

Yes they play a lot of the Jazz classics and even some new stuff, but it seems that it's all in the vein of straight ahead or vocal jazz.  I rarely hear anything experimental.  

The station's understanding of New Jazz is far off.  I rarely hear any Mehldau, don't think I've heard a Redman or Rosenwinkel track, and bet your ass they won't drop some Kneebody or Wayne Krantz.

I can understand why they program in this manner, because they're probably not trying to alienate their base of listeners in sun city.  

Anyways, I'd rather listen to NPR then Blaze spinning kind of blue for 12 hours straight.Maybe my hopes were too high when I made plans to go to Sunsplash.  I was overwhelmed by the crowd.  So many people were crammed into this relatively small space.  Never in my life have I seen a line for a wave pool.  I typically think of the wave pool as a retreat from the lines.  Not at Sunsplash. The lazy river was so packed I could hardly see the "river" part.  Not exactly a relaxing experience.  

Not only that, but the water park seemed less than sanitary.  I saw several people with bloody noses, and I couldn't help but wonder when the last time they thoroughly sanitized the place.  The park is also open at night...I will not be venturing over to Sunsplash after dark.  You know what likes to come out at night?  Bugs.  Big ones.  (I'm a Coloradan...call me spoiled...but large bugs just aren't a part of life where I'm from.)

The slides are fun, especially the gigantic ones.  If you plan to go on the big slides, be sure to bring your friends!  Expect to carry a massive raft up several flights of stairs.  There are no mechanisms that bring the empty rafts up to the slide entrance for customers.  I got a workout just by hauling our raft around!

Whatever you do, do NOT open your water bottles prior to entering the park.  They will throw them out.  Bring a few gigantic bottles and rent a locker; a large cup of ice can be purchased at the concession stand for 25 cents.  Bring cash too.  A locker is $11, but you receive $5 back when you present your receipt with the locker key.  Also, I recommend bringing some plastic flip-flops.  There's nothing worse than tromping around dirty grounds covered with strangers' hairs and other disgusting debris.  

Food is quite pricey (no surprise here).  It is a fun place to spend a Saturday, just don't expect anything too elaborate.I just called to find out if they have incense smoking bottles and the hangers. I then wanted to know the price and was told, "We don't do pricing over the phone but our prices are very reasonable." Well, they are usually a little higher than other places. Also, I live in the West Valley and don't want to drive to Tempe from here if the price is too much. You may have just lost my business with your lack of customer service.The thin-crust was super-thin, possibly the thinnest in Tempe. It also tasted like cardboard, the finest cardboard in Tempe. Definitely more "bistro" than "pizza bistro" I will not return.Disappointing. I waited over 45 min for a $25 pizza that tasted like a frozen deep dish pizza you get from the grocery store.Reading the reviews it is clear that there is serious East Coast loyalty for Dunkin Donuts - regardless of the customer service and quality at this specific location. 

People, please keep in mind: this is not an Edward vs Jacob decision, that is clearly important but subjective. No, we're talking about coffee and there ARE in fact metrics we can use to evaluate (and should use) to make our morning beverage decisions. Specifically, quality and customer service. 

1. Quality 
The donuts here don't taste all that fresh, at least to me. I'll have one and then wonder why because it wasn't all that delicious. I much prefer the donuts at Krispy Kreme or Bosa Donuts to the ones at Dunkin Donuts. 

As for the coffee, it tastes somewhat watered down in my opinion. It's not all that strong and doesn't have much flavor. When I order my morning coffee, it would be nice to have the choice of different roasts rather than whatever generic coffee flavor was just brewed.

2. Customer Service
This is were this DD location really misses the boat and is the reason why I will not be returning. This location is poorly designed with too little space inside to have a counter with chairs right along side the double line of people that forms in the morning. Encountering a line is one thing, but I don't appreciate feeling rushed through the line and barked at with the line, "What are you drinking?" At least at Starbucks and Dutch Bros the staff say, "Good morning," or express some pleasantries before just asking for my order. I also am disappointed that this location does not have carafes with milk. Asking how many sugars and half and half I want makes me feel like I'm giving my order to a flight attendant and then I panic thinking to myself, "What if that's not enough? What if I change my mind?" I have two hands and I'd like to decide how much cream and sugar to add to my own coffee, thank you!This is one of the very few food places near where we live.  While it's not a particularly great pizza place, it's not bad either.  There are tables inside and the staff is generally friendly.  They have a nice-sized LCD on one wall where patrons can watch whatever game is on.

The pizza is serviceable, though not remarkable.  They serve lunch and have quite a few specials.  We probably get pizza from here once or twice a month.I got a chicken sandwich and wings. The chicken sandwich was made with that cheap partical chicken patty that you commonly find on most $1menu chicken sandwiches. The wings were so so. The wings themselves were pretty small but the sauce was good but not hot enough to be considered "hot".

My main complaint is that they are 2 blocks away from me and it still took them 50 minutes to get the food to me (10 minutes more than the quoted time). I could have walked there and back in that time.At this point, would suggest Spinato's or even Mellow Mushroom first.  The place is okay, but the quality is uneven to say it lightly.While this place can be very lively and entertaining
and it has a great neighborhood/dive vibe going on, it almost always dissappoints me.
I want so badly to like this place and make it my home away from casey's however they do their best to make it hard.
hard on the atmosphere: 9 times outta ten its dead, no one there and nothing going on
hard on the wallet: when something IS actually happenin like some live music or just a good crowd there is always a cover, and they seem to jack up their prices
hard on the pallet: no good beer selections. have fun sipping on piss tasting domestics
overall i seem to just get alienated from this bar, despite its potential. in my opinion they should shape up or sail outOverpriced small plates. Ordered the chicken strips which is listed as coming with ranch, BBQ or honey mustard. Asked for honey mustard & BBQ, received ranch. When I asked for the right sides was told they've never had honey mustard. Maybe take it off the menu? Mom Ordered a virgin strawberry margarita. It was thin and watered down tasting. Pick it up improv!
Comics were alright. Apparently it was Arabic night or something, I'd say about 85% of audience was of middle eastern descent as we're the comics. Most of the jokes were geared towards their background & political areas. 
Previously the improv allowed 18-20yr olds only in the upper balcony. The show we attended was actually 15+, there was a small amount of cursing, heard the F bomb just twice. Check their schedule as some shows are 21+, some 18+, and some now even 15+.I have been a regular at the Tempe Improv for years. Years and years. We go probably 5-6 times a year easy. I was so sad when they closed their doors. The first time we went since they reopened was a 4 star experience bordering on 5. I was very happy and so glad to have my Tempe Improv back. So off we went 3 weeks later with the whole family to see another show. Now when you plan a night out, and you have to arrange babysitters etc. You want a night out! My niece got the babysitter, we made a reservation way in advance and we arrive at the door. 

But it is closed. We call wondering what we did wrong and they tell us that they are closed because of storm damage. It happens. This would be completly understandable and they would still have 4 stars. However, no one notified us. Any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly. How hard would it have been to send a blanket email saying we apologize for the inconvienence but we have to cancel this weekends shows due to storm damage. Not only did we arrive to find this out, but the people on the phone were like oops. Not I am so sorry, we will have someone contact you to remedy this, nope. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Oops is not an acceptable answer. 

This is not an acceptable level of service and so very dissappointing from a local treasure. Customer service is not that hard. A text, email, anything and I would not be writting this review. I would be writting a much different account. I am actually really sad. Oh well. Time to try one of the other local comedy clubs we now have. Gotta love competition, they now have my buisness.

They have contacted me this week to try to remedy this. I will be giving them another try and will write a review update when I go back.Meh!! This is a typical AZ hyped up joint. I have eaten here twice. Both times have left much to desire. First off the bread was toooo freakin thick. The meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture. I just don't get why people think it's sooo good. I have some good sandwiches in my life from some of the most famous in NY and LA to San diego and SF. This place sucks in comparison to most. Not my kind of place. Hell Miracle mile is 10 times better than this place and I don't really prefer that either but I would go there over this Silly dilly place!Food was very good.

Customer service was TERRIBLE!! 
No one person even said HELLO, or made us feel welcomed with ever a smile.At first glance when I walked in I liked the atmosphere,classic dinner style,the servers were friendly,the owner im assuming was not to say the least,sloppy appearance,just looked down at me,didn't say a word,from what I could see he did nothing but get in the way of the workers and pull the boss card.I had a good laugh at this while I waited on my orders of there classic money island dogs.here goes.the dog itself was Vienna,woopie.they were not that big in size,they were all burnt to a crisp.but tried to disguise that with there chili and onions and cheese and sauce.the chili was ok.so not good,seemed like it was a canned product with a twist"spices".I wont go back for the hotdogs,but I will try it once more for there breakfast,id rather go to teds hotdogs.so stayed tuned yelpersI REALLY don't know how to rate this place... I'm giving it two stars because I seriously HAVE experienced better. Let me explain.

My friend and I, after wandering around for nearly an hour searching for somewhere to eat, our quest ended (or atleast we THOUGHT it was going to end) at Lo Cascio's. We entered a very quaint and fancier than it really ought to be little italian place. There was a young couple, a middle aged couple and a three top already enjoying their meals. We sat down and tried to figure out what to order.

The service was so-so. Nothing great. but we ordered anyway, I ordered the gnocci with tomato sauce and sausage. My friend ordered the speghetti and meatballs. We had different soups before our meal and were served the soups along with our teas.

My bean and pasta soup... was not good. It was seriously a bowl of pinto beans with some pasta in it. No spices, no veggies... nothing but pinto beans and baby macaroni. wtf?? My friend's minastrone (yeah I know it's mispelled!) wasn't that great eaither. No complaints, but no rave reviews eaither. We had hoped the entrees were going to be better when...

"What the HELL do you mean you won't serve me another drink?!?!"

A shout from the middle aged man who sat with (I'm assuming was his date) a small petite blonde woman. The server tried her best to get the man to settle down, the more she tried to calm him down - the angrier the bastard got. He got to the point where he was yelling and screaming at her and even stood up and got in her face.

the male busser who served us our teas, watched while hiding behind a drink station along with one of the cooks. Another male. We watched in sympathy as the poor waitress was being bullied by this guy... it took EVERYTHING for me NOT to get up and kick this guy's ass!

"Remember where you are!! This is scottsdale! If the cops show up, they're gonna throw us BOTH in!! and let his ass go free!!" was the words I needed to hear... seriously. I wish Scottsdale Police would quit being so racist. 

Finally when he had his face in hers, I said fuck it.

"WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!" I asked to the entire room. The busser came and he said that the three-top next to us were the OWNERS!! An elderly woman and her husband and brother... owned the damned resturant and were now staring into their soups and drinks trying to pretend the entire thing wasn't happening. No body was going to defend this poor girl. I started to get up, fuck it TAKE ME TO JAIL!

Yes... I really do get that hood. I'm sorry - I'm not your average yelper... I have and will probably cut a bitch (again). 

and FINALLY the elderly woman, with her neckbrace and casted arm (seriously! I'm not lying) got up and tried her best to calm the man down. I was appaulled. I never seen such an outburst like that since... the LAST time I ate in Scottsdale! (haha! I just realized that!) But even then, the manager intercepted right away and took care of the rowdy customer... in this case, I really think the owners would have let this guy get violent with her. I know violent men and I know how they work... and this guy was on the edge. 

we called the busser aside and asked for our check for the food that we were served and not the food we ordered. They gave it to us along with a coupon for 20% our next visit. I vowed to give this place another try.

Seriously, it wasn't their fault. No one WANTED this guy to become a jerk. He chose that and sometimes it's not right to fault a restuant on the behaviors of its customers. and that guy was loaded! and obviously had one too many, the waitress was just doing her job. but it was NOT okay for the owners to let her get abused like that... EVER!

I have even seen executive chefs come out of the kitchen and calmed customers down (ANOTHER time I dined in Scottsdale! haha!! errrm... I'm noticing a theme!) but I never seen a bunch of scared ass pussies look the other way like that. so for that, this place loses major stars.I had heard good things about Lo Cascio, had heard that they were voted "Best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale" and when I walked in and saw the old Italian couple walk out from the kitchen I thought I was in luck!  Wrong.  The food was WAY over priced, and not that great.  Maybe I'm just used to (spoiled by?) MY old Italian grandma's cooking, but what I ate was not all that fantastic.  Not  "Best in Scottsdale" fantastic.  I live in Scottsdale.  My Italian cooking is better.  We ordered from the "smaller portions" menu, and while it WAS a perfect sized portion, it was not worth what we paid for it.  Also, they put sesame seeds on their bread.  Sesame seeds in an Italian restaurant??  Why?  Italian bread (GOOD Italian bread) is delicious without adding anything.  Their bread had a soft crust (again, covered in sesame seeds for some reason) and the inside was on the mushy side.  Not the hard crusted, spongy Italian bread to which I've always been accustomed. 

One thing I did like about this restaurant was that instead of serving you a side of pasta with your entree, you have the option to sub it with fried zucchini, which I did, and it was pretty good.  Although it's hard to screw something up when you bread it and fry it.  

Bottom line, we won't be visiting here again.2.5 stars... 

Great shows come through here, the building is cool to look at in a retro way and the seating is roomy, as mentioned in previous reviews. 

But... 

The parking lot SUCKS: if at ALL possible, find a parking space you can back into (if not possible, figure out a way to back into the space anyway); there is such thing as a "bad" seat here and the acoustics are good for music but not voices.This review is based purely on the venue and not the productions held here. I have seen many shows at Gammage. Recently I have seen War Horse and Beauty and the Beast in the orchestra section which have both been amazing! Gammage itself however is not so amazing. The outside of the building is beautiful and eye catching but the inside not so much. 

The restroom situation alone is enough for any woman to go crazy. Gammage has two restroom locations. One is on the second floor and quite a walk from the orchestra section seats especially when you only have fifteen minutes during intermission and the second location is on the third floor near the top balcony. Once you get to the bathroom, no matter when, before the show, during intermission (is the worst), and after the show, the wait is at least 25 to 30 women waiting, 10 to 15 minutes. Forget having time to purchase a drink or snack. The bathroom itself has only six stalls which are dimly lit (more like you need a flashlight to see anything) and old as can be. Once you are finally done using the facilities and need to dry your hands after washing, good luck with the paper towel line if the dispenser is even working. Bottom line, use the bathroom before and after the show not at Gammage which I know can sometimes be difficult during a 2 to 4 hour show. Note to Gammage - Immediately do a renovation on the bathrooms! Ticket sales will increase as a result!

The seats are just okay. The performances are usually amazing and it usually does not matter where you sit in that regard but the cushions on seat backs once again could use some renovation. I will continue going to Gammage because it is one of the only locations in Phoenix to host Broadway productions but I do hope that they make some improvements in the near future.Cue Club isn't what it is all hyped up to be. I have no clue why it's as popular as it is... No one even plays pool in the back. It's completely over crowded and super annoying if you are going out with a large group of people. Other than that... Their drinks are  good for a decent price. Long islands are pretty toxic as well as electric lemonade, but if you are dragged their by your friends then I always tell people to get the liquid marijuana Its offered as a shot, but it's better as a drink.I don't know where to begin, I was born in California, lived in Chicago for 15 years both of those locales had better Mexican food. Now after living in Arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots. What is the deal Mexican food here so close to the border yet the flavor and colors of this food don't illustrate any thing but drab and boring. Pureed guacamole is not what I was expecting when I ordered it to accompany my Combo Grande of Chile Rellano and Chicken enchilada, do not order the fideo way too soupy and it taste like watered down spaghetti O's not good. I love Mexican food but I won't be back here to have it.No matter what you order the salsa and hot sauce aren't good.  The hot sauce is just not good. The salsa tastes like they added vinegar to preserve it. Otherwise, it might be good if they made it fresh and more often. I've lived in Az over 50 years.There are only a few things that a mexican restaurant needs to get right, sauce is one of them.Not impressed at all.  This is the 3rd place we have used to board our dog.  They seemed to treat him more like a number.  We used Pete and Mac's our last visit and they were much better.  They didn't do anything wrong just felt like the Walmart of pet hotels.  No followup call, no detail in the report, and very transaction interaction at check in and out.  Ranks 3rd out of the 3 we have used.I heard from some friends that this place was awesome and that it was much better than Pita Jungle.  If its better than Pita I am all over it.  My husband and I went and we got the two most popular things on their menu plus an iced tea.  The flavors were very nice but I didnt like the use of dark chicken meat.  To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.  He had a sampler with grape leaves, meat balls, rice, etc.  it wasnt that good but we brought it home and I warmed it up the next day and it was much better for some reason.I visited this venue looking for quick lunch and a gyro was what was on my mind. I was greeted quickly upon entry to a vacant restaurant. Not sure if this was a good sign or just a slow period of the day. The venue looks nice, was clean, and a little bit confusing. Greek restaurant over powered by Skyy Vodka??? Say what? Moreover, and although a cold mixed drink would have nice....lunch time was my target. Also, I was searching for a nice new venue to visit during my lunch break, etc.  Now here comes the low down.....a 5 dollar lunch menu...sweet! Until I got my gyro and fries....thats where it went down hill. For 5 bucks a gyro should be filled with meat, lettuce and whatever the white sauce was. Instead I got a gyro with 3 - 2 inch long strips of meat....wtf? The fries (which were an additional 99 cents extra) were nice and crispy. That gyro was damn pitiful and for that this place gets 2 stars. Lets get some more meat on them and Ill reconsider....for now consider this to be continued!I recently told a friend that I cant figure out why there is no good Mexican restaurants in Tempe. His response was what about MacAyo's? I responded with "why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?"

Seriously if anyone out there knows of any legit Mexican in Tempe let me know. And don't say restaurant Mexico!Let me start by saying, I'm not a fan of the food here.  I grew up on authentic and traditional mexican food, Macayo's is neither.  The only reason I go here, is that it is close to our workplace and my coworkers like to go here for margaritas, chips and salsa.

I just came from the Depot Cantina location in Tempe, Arizona, where I had the worst chicken fajitas I've ever eaten.  Others at my table even commented that from the moment then saw them, they didn't look that good.  I ate about a third of it.

The chicken was barely cooked and not seasoned or marinated at all.  There were more green chile's than there was chicken, and they looked like they had just been dumped from the can.  The very few onions that were on the skillet were, in fact, still crisp -- meaning not cooked at all. 

Horrible, horrible food.

Oh, and I should add -- be careful of the seating on the patio.  There are numerous lights and wires strung about the patio, which enables the many birds in the area to "pepper" the seating and tables.I really wanted to like Macayo's.  The open layout was festively decorated and had a fun vibe.  It has a great location near the light rail stop.  Unfortunately the food and drink didn't measure up.  I sampled the spinach con queso, sour cream chicken enchiladas, cheese enchiladas, fajita quesadilla and beef taquitos.  Generally, the food was heavy and dull, with little in the way of interesting spices or flavors to liven it up.  Macayo's take on the quesadilla will disappoint cheese lovers, as it is mostly filled with meat and peppers.

I made the mistake of ordering the "special" blue margarita, which had a splash of blue curacao.  The server assured me it would taste just like a regular margarita, but it was dreadful - the cloying sweetness completely smothered the lime tartness I was craving. 

 If  you go, enjoy the fun interior but don't expect a breakout Mexican food experience.The best part about this place is the patio during the nice months here in AZ its a great place to grab a drink for happy hour. The lunch specials are reasonable they have items from $6.99, 7.99, 8.99 and up. With the free chips and salsa i find that a $6.99 item and a water is just enough. Their menu had advertised $2.00 bottle beer which was a nice treat for lunch. I've tried their nachos and Bravo burro which both were decent, nothing special some of the $6.99 items don't come w rice and beans so pay attn. The service is good if your in a hurry for lunch it wont be a issue to get in and out plus the place is located a block off Mill ave and close to a light rail stop.First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.

Having purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.Oops! Looks like I'm breaking the trend of five-star reviews.

This place is okay, but definitely not 5 star-worthy.

First, the eats: The pastries, while I'm glad to say are made with decent ingredients (they post them, and there's no soy crap or margarines/hydrogenated oils), they're not very impressive. Their cookies are the hard, crunchy kind which I generally dislike (especially when they look big enough to be the soft kind). The other pastries, like their red bean rolls and things of that nature, are reminiscent of a sweet hot dog bun filled with whatever filling. I will admit I haven't tried any of their cakes, but given that I didn't like the other stuff...

Next, they're not too great with customer service; especially ostensible contrast. What I mean by that is that both times I've been in there, I have been preceded by a Japanese customer to whom they were very jovial and nice. Then, here comes the white guy (me) and they're kinda like "eh." They also really oughtta hire a woman to be up front, as the guys there (including the old guy I saw in the back) all seem pretty brooding and preoccupied.

I dunno; I get the tendency of people to give 5 star reviews based on the fact a place is locally owned and/or novel (Wow, real Japanese people!). I just feel that in this case, it's hype.Super small portions. This is hands down the smallest bowl of pho I have ever had ($6.25). The pho came out in the standard size bowl. When it arrives you can see only broth... which can be normal. Many places you have to get your chopsticks in there to fluff up and separate the noodles. When I dipped my chopsticks in, I found myself stirring about a few pieces of noodles and no joke, 3 pieces of beef, 2 pieces of tripe, and 3 small pieces of tendon. I am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point. But wait, what about the broth. The broth was was too sweet which masked any depth of flavor. There are many better options in the Tempe area.If your like frozen drinks, this is your place.  Had a hoping Mardi Gras party.  But I want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar.Oh Dear Lord, this place scares me. I think Fat's is the perfect place for a bar crawl for a 21st, tourists who don't know any better, bachelorette party nightmare, or a themed night out where everyone pretends its 1990s and that daiquiris are still a cool drink. The few times I have been unwittingly dragged here, the service was always good, the drinks were strong and the food was blah. I just can't get over the slushie machines at the bar (there's something so wrong about that, when were they last cleaned!) and the boob beads everywhere. Maybe on Bourbon Street, but not here, I think I'll be going else where.PROS:
~The guy working the front desk (the only one, the whole 4 days I was there) was friendly.
~The other people staying there were very friendly and talkative.
~The pool was pretty cool.

CONS:
~Bad location. Pretty sketchy.
~Bad rooms. The TV did not work properly and made random loud noises.
~I kept feeling like the guy at the front desk was hitting on me, which is very unprofessional and not really acceptable.
~Breakfast was gross.

As you can see, the cons outweigh the pros. Not a great choice.The room was adequate for the price. I guess you really do get what you pay for! Outside was in need of some major tlc and groundskeeping. Front desk people were very nice and helpful. As for breakfast, you'd be better off going to the Denny's that sits next door!Ate here once.  I found the burger utterly uninspiring.  It's pretty standard diner fare, except they don't do it particularly well.  It feels a bit like eating at a cafeteria with waitresses.

The staff is friendly enough, and the prices are fair, but they need more flavorful food, better decor, and less cheap feeling furniture.  Maybe a decent lunch option of you work within walking distance.The food here is good, but in no way is it great. The steaks are okay, often they sear it a little too much and it ends up way too burnt on the outside. The actual facility is really cool, full of history. Prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling.Three words: NOT WORTH IT.

We went here with family friends after a recital at ASU (though just after the workday for us) to celebrate.  Finding a nice restaurant for a large group to eat at in Tempe that isn't filled with college students (who are inebriated) is difficult.  There are some, but cost always comes into play and so we ended up at Monti's.  

The food was ... ok.  The bread was ok, my salad was ok, my meal was ok.  The service was terrible.  The waitress was incompetent.  I expected at an "institution" such as Monti's that I wouldn't have a waitress so incapable of taking simple instructions.  Or to know the very limited drinks list.  I mean, I ordered one of the only decent glasses of wine on their menu and she didn't know what I was saying.  It was ridiculous. 

Clearly I expected better out of a restaurant with such a reputation.  I will not be returning as there are far better restaurants in the valley and Tempe to dine at (and steakhouses).One of the easiest restaurants on Mill Avenue to park since they have a HUGE lot.

Arrived at around 4 PM on a Saturday and had to wait to be seated.

Older/historic building is huge but not that nice.

The service was the best part.  Our youngish male waiter was personable and just the right amount of service without being pushy.

The bread was amazing.  I enjoyed the rosemary and thought it was the tastiest part of our meal.

The rib eye steak I had was one of the worst steaks I have had.  The level of quality was less than I am used to.  Gotta say T-bones, Firebirds and even Texas Roadhouse are WAY better.  Even Longhorn is better.

The broccolini was cooked strangely and I didn't enjoy it - lack of flavor and in between al dente and cooked enough.

I would not go back.  If I wan't the area I will stick to their patio restaurant.  If I want steak I would go anywhere else.Ummm...well....they have parrots in the lobby....I guess thats a good thing.

I would never stay here. A few of my friends are staying here and I went to visit them. Everything about the hotel needs a complete update. The rooms are old and smelly. The paint in the shower was peeling. The tv did not really work good. I think I could feel the springs in the mattress.

It is right across the street from Gammage auditorium .... so if you are visiting ASU I guess it has a pretty good location. But thats about it.

Oh yeah, there is an IHOP attached to the hotel,....so if you get fed up of your crappy hotel room you could always go downstairs and get some mediocre pancakes. 

I would give it just 1 star...but they allow dogs so I will give them 2 just because it always sucks trying to find a place to travel when you have your pooch.I really hate to give such a poor star rating because I really like the idea of this place.  The restaurant is so unique and I absolutly love the outdoor seating.  The atmosphere is very romantic and intimate.  The problem I have with this place is the unconsistency of the food.  The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.  So imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par.  My boyfriend took me here for my bday dinner and the only really memorable part of the experience was the AMAZING wine choice our very knowledgable waiter suggested.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs; I'm not sure if it was just a bad cut but it was over 50% fat.  I ordered the bacon wrapped tuna; it didnt seem that the tuna was marinated or seasoned at all, and overall the plate was simply uninteresting. 

The atmosphere and service here is great, but our last dining experience will probably keep us from ever returning.  For the quality of food we recieved, we were robbed.  It's never a good experience paying $200 for a dinner and feeling completly unsatisfied.  Sorry Tricks.Overpriced, mediocre food, uninformed and disinterested service. Will not return.OVER-RATED, OVER-PRICED, OVER-IT!

Best part about this restaurant are the friendly stray cats that hang out around the patio begging for scraps of food.  

The food was decent but not worth the price.  Any foody could come up with the dishes and anyone overly impressed obviously isn't adventurous enough with their foods.

It's pretty but so is my backyard.

All in all, meh.Overall, not worthy of all the hype.

I visited House of Tricks for a Friday business lunch. Although they didn't seem overly busy, everything was quite slow from the drink service through the food delivery to the process of getting the check. You know that part of the meal when all conversation is exhausted and everyone is glancing around wondering when they can go? You want your check before that point, usually.

The food is fresh-tasting but unremarkable. I had a Moroccan fruit and chicken shawarma salad. The dressing was OK but too little of it. The chicken was dry. The lettuce just seemed like garden variety (har har) boxed salad mix you would get from Costco or a food service. Pretty boring.

I won't be back.Work on Mill Avenue so visit Uno's about 1x/week as its really close to my office.  The manager Jay is really a great guy so makes visiting their often a good experience. It's a pizza place so I am giving Uno's only 3 stars because their pizza is horrible.  I stick with their soup and salad lunch special and that is good.  I really like the clam chowder soup.  The rattlesnake pasta is also pretty good. I am from back east so maybe a Pizza Snob but if I wanted cardboard pizza I would order Domino's and save a few $$$,

Wow just saw this review of best and worst Pizza's to eat.  Check it out at http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/36451/the-best-and-worst-pizzas-in-america/ and Wow the Uno Chicago Grill Chicago Classic Deep Dish Individual Pizza is 2,310 calories and 165g fat.  Oh my.  Guess I won't be ordering that again.Most of the stuff here is new, not used, and these are NOT thrift store prices. you can randomly find some deals on name brand stuff like Volcom and Lucky jeans, but i don't usually even bother stopping in here anymore. 
they have shoes, selection is hit or miss, purses (new and used), jewelry (new), hats (new and used), house wares (new)...they've really expanded -literally and figuratively - in the last 12 years or so since i've been going.
don't bother trying to sell something unless it's a really sweet vintage piece or top brand label and with the tags still attached... that's all they will tell you they can take at any given time, yet they must keep it all for themselves because i rarely see that kind of merch out on the floor.We enjoy the food.  We think it's a good value.  The people directly interfacing w/ customers are fairly nice at all the locations we've purchased from.  

HOWEVER ... all the locations display  signs that implicitly tell the customers 'You and all your petty little demands bother us'.  Wifey and I know Pete's as "No-No's" ...

Want stuffed mushroom caps on Fridays?  Forgedaboudit!  Pete's can't be bothered: "NO mushroom caps on Fridays."  We the customers are obviously there to serve them.

Want to swipe your debit or credit card?  Not happening at Pete's, no sir!  Pete's doesn't want 98% of your money, they want ALL 100%!  "NO credit or debit cards," says the sign by the window.

Want change for a $50?  Work that out with your bank:  "NO bills larger than $20."

GREAT businesses are those who anticipate customers' needs and serve them better than anyone else.

Here's what's going on at Pete's -- Pete died years ago, and his great ideas along with him.   His daughters carry the business forward, but certainly not with the zeal, inspiration, and dedication of the original owner.  Maybe they figure carrying pop's business along beats getting real jobs.  Pete's is an idea that has grown long in the tooth.  It stays in business because of a host of people satisfied with 'okay' food and service who aren't interested in much else.

Want a REALLY GREAT  fish and chips experience?  Get ye over to Seattle's Best Fish & Chips, 9015 E. Via Linda in Scottsdale -- SE Corner of Via Linda and 90th St.  The contrast between Seattle's Best and Pete's is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.  Note Seattle's Best's YELP reviews, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

So long, No No's !My sandwich was pretty decently priced. Good quality meat. It wasnt busy, so I got in and out very fast.

My only 2 complaints: My lettuce was white and brown. Not appetizing at all.
 That, and I asked for them to go "easy on the mayo", which apparently meant to slop it on so that it literally drips, huge drops of mayo, out of the bottom while being eaten.

Meh. There are much better sandwich places in the same area.Dos Gringos is definitely bringing trashy back.  And I think the whole trailer park theme has really gotten the best of them.  Two cases in point.

A) Drinks are EXTREMELY weak.  They give you tall glasses, but have very thin pours of liquor.  Thinking maybe it was the vodka, we switched to rum, but alas, the trailer park was just being cheap. 

B) The vomit stench wafting from the mens restroom really takes the trailer park theme a little too far, right?  After I reported to staff that puke was all over a men's urinal, it was still there an hour later.

Doesn't that make you yearn for the good old college days??

Granted it was a Sunday afternoon and all, and the DJ and crowd was fun.  A definite fun place to day drink, and bring the pooch.  Call me an old-fashioned prude, but the puke-fest and sucky drinks kind of killed the mood.  And believe it or not, I didn't have the appetite to try any of their award-winning tacos.Thumbs down... bigtime. 

We were seated and no one came to our table to acknowledge us. After 10-15 minutes we had to actually get up and flag someone down to ask who our server was. The waiter, utterly confused, then walks around the restaurant polling the other staff members, "Is this your table?" everyone else is equally confused shaking their head no. Finally he comes back and says, "this isn't my section, but I'll take your order anyway". Wow... thank you so much for the magnanimous gesture. 

We place our drink order and it takes 10+ minutes to arrive. Our server asks if we would like bread... we say yes... add about 15 minutes for the bread guy to arrive. 

When our main entrees finally arrived (scallops and veal), we thought the quality of the food was fair to good however the portion sizes are exceptionally small. I understand this is how many finer dining type of places present their dishes however usually the quality of the food and the service override any qualms about portion size. 

We spent around $120 for the two of us and I left very disappointed.

It's going to be a long, long time before we visit again.I used to love Caffe Boa. I work nearby and when someone would suggest Boa for lunch I would jump at the chance. I haven't been there in a while and today I think I figured out why no one suggests to go there anymore - it's not as good!

We (party of 3) arrived at about 12:15, the place was not very busy so we got a nice spot outside. Looking at the menu we immediately noticed it had changed. They used to have several great salad options, now they only have three. It looked like they have less pasta too. I ordered a half salad and half sandwich. The other two girls ordered salads. We didn't get our food until 1:00 pm! It's not like we took a long time to order. Good thing we weren't in a hurry. 

They came by and gave us bread and dip, which was good, but they only gave us one piece of bread each and never came back to offer more. Not that I want to pig out but I thought one piece of bread was a little stingy.  

When it finally came, my turkey sandwich was kinda blah. Even the red pepper mayo on it didn't add much life to it. I think there was cheese on it but I couldn't really tell. My salad was just okay - mixed greens with candied pecans, bleu cheese and pears, well, two tiny slivers of pear. 

Overall, I was very underwhelmed and after we got back to work my co-worker expressed the same displeasure. I want my old Caffe Boa back!I was in the Mill Avenue area and decided to pass up the chain restaurants and have lunch at Caffe Boa.

It was nice outside so I chose to sit on the patio.

I pretty much always order iced tea for lunch but Caffe Boa only had the bottled Republic of Tea offerings.  Those are ok but a little pricey so I decided to have a Bass ale instead.

Looking at the lunch menu I chose the meatball panini.  That's when things went downhill.  When my panini arrived it looked kinda thin and so I opened it up.  It contained the peppers and marinara sauce promised on the menu, but no meatballs, only a thin sprinkling of ground meat.

Can Phoenix be Phoenix without 115 degree summer temperatures?  Can spaghetti be spaghetti without noodles?  Can a meatball panini be a meatball panini without meatballs?  I think not!!

I asked my server about this and he informed me that they had indeed changed the recipe.  He did offer to go back to the kitchen to get a couple of meatballs but I declined.

I think I'll stick with DeFalco's for my meatball sandwiches.Based on rave reviews from other Yelpers, I went to Caffe Boa with high expectations.  Alas, my experience there was a bit of a disappointment due to said high expectations.  

My sister and I had a reservation for an early dinner (5pm) yesterday and after lucking out on a parking spot right in front (coin-operated meter); we were seated pretty quickly by the (unsmiling) hostess.  At this time, we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant.  

The décor and vibe featured a modern and elegant main dining room on the inside and an intimate patio area decorated with intertwining vines and bursts of colors from flowers.  The restaurant began to fill up by 6pm and consisted mostly of casual to business-casual middle-aged folks.  

I started off with a glass of their Pinot Grigio ($7) and found it to be very smooth and strong.  The Brushetta ($10) consisted of huge slices of Ciabatta bread, topped with slices olives, capers, chunks of tomatoes, and slices of basil.  This was my fave dish of the night as it was so full of flavor (albeit a bit chunky in texture).  We tried eating this as daintily as we could but ended up making a big mess.   

I was wavering between trying the Agnolotti (grilled forest mushroom ravioli) or the Autumn Maccaroncello (butternut squash with wild honey sauce and goat cheese pasta) and opted for the Maccaroncello ($17) since I was intrigued by the combination of ingredients.  When the waiter brought the dish over, my belly did a happy flip since it looked and smelled delicious.  I took the first bite and although the initial taste was packed full of butternut squash and cheese flavor, I was a bit taken aback by the saltiness of the sauce and the "too al dente" texture of the pasta.  I drank a sip of water to cleanse my palate and tried another bite...with the same result!  Being an optimist (when it comes to food), I drank a sip of the wine and tried another bite...same darn result!  Sigh, sigh, sigh!  At this point I felt full and so settled back to watch my sister pick at her dish...read below. 

My sister initially chose the Toasted Herb Gnocchi (milk braised Dutch Valley veal sweetbreads in gravy) but after being told by the waiter that the sweetbreads won't be ready for consumption for who knows how long, she opted for the Mezzaluna Ravioli ($16 / pork stuffed ravioli in broth).  When the waiter brought her plate over, I almost choked on my glass of wine.  The darned dish looked just like a bowl of steamed wontons in broth that one can find at a Chinese restaurant! My sister said it tasted just like wontons too and offered me a bite...which I declined.  

Although we wanted to try the tiramisu, we opted out of that due to our disappointment in our dishes.  

Our waiter provided very good service and seemed eager to please. Caffe Boa's website boasts that their menu consists of Mediterranean, Slavic, Asian, and Cajun preparation and states that they focus on using seasonally inspired, all natural, organic ingredients.  I agree that their ingredients seemed fresh and I did taste the Asian influence in the dishes; however, the effort fell short of my expectations.  I admire the chef for his innovation though, and will have to give this restaurant another try before I completely give up on them.  

Overall, for one glass of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, our bill came to approximately $50 (before tip).We went here the our 10th anniversary (of the day we met) and were very disappointed.

1. We made a reservation and had to fight with the guy. They didnt have the time we wanted so we just said we would come in another time. Then all of the sudden, he did have the time. 

2. When we got there we were told they needed a few minutes to get out table ready, and that we should hang out in the bar and get a drink while we waited. We walk in and half the tables in the place are empty. We waited 15 minutes in the bar watching the fact that every group the hostess seated was sitting in the bar also. Total Scam. They're trying to get your bill up with alcohol sales. 

3. Service was good at first.

4. We split a side salad, which basically consisted of eight whole leaves of green lettuces on a plate. It was $9.

5. It took about 30 minutes fr our food to arrive, all the while the chef is yakking it up with the next table over, dropping the F bomb left and right, and talking about getting high. 

6. I ordered the seafood ravioli. It was tiny, about 6 small pieces, and tasted GROSS. The sauce reminded me of salt and vinegar chips. 

7. My husband ordered the toasted gnocchi. The pork portion was about 1/2 fat and was also about 2 inches cubed. The 10 little tine gnocchi tasted ok, but the chopped vegetable based was undercooked and the broth was so salty it was inedible. 

8 . When we were ready to leave, it took 10 minutes for our bill to arrive. 

We will NEVER go back. Over priced, disgusting scam.Is the owner over it or something?  This place used to be awesome.  Every once and a while, my friends and I will come in to see if it's shaping up to what it used to be.  Nope.  I have a feeling his employees will be forced to start job hunting soon.

To all of you looking for an upbeat experience with good italian food, the Parlor OR Cibo in Phoenix is where it's at.

Sorry, Boa.  It's not me-it's you.As others have pointed out, the menu has changed drastically, but I didn't actually have a problem with the change. The food we ordered came out fine. Not anything to write home about, but certainly a touch above mediocre. 

The problem was the waitress. We were sitting outside and it was quite chilly. She convinced us to order some spiced tea to warm ourselves up and did a good job selling the idea. But the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us. We didn't even get any waters or the chance to flag her down. Another server dropped off our food in about twenty minutes and we had to ask him to get us some water. How is this acceptable at all? The waitress stopped by and said the bar didn't get the tea together and apologized, promising that she'd send the manager over. The manager never came over and it took another fifteen minutes after we finished eating to get the check and to pay. 

This place isn't cheap, but even if it was, I would expect better service than what my friend and I received.I ordered a salad, the SoCal Love.  It was okay.  About a 1/4 head of butter lettuce, maybe half a tomato, 1/4 avocado (a little over ripe), sprouts.  And a small piece of chicken so tough I had to ask for a steak knife.  $12.25 and no croutons.  And this place will not give you a piece of regular Italian bread.  
I was with seven other people and most of the ordered pasta.  Bread to scoop up all that sauce? Nope, you can't get it at this place.  You can order bruschetta, or flat bread.  But you can't get a piece of freaking Italian bread.Haven't been to Cafe Boa in years due to a just OK for the price experience years ago when they were at their old location a few blocks south.  Decided to check it out after seeing the restaurant reviewed on a local PBS show "Check Please".  

We started off at the bar to take advantage of their happy hour which includes glass of wine priced under $10 for half price as well as a limited number of appetizers.  The wine was OK for half price. My partner and I split the Big Ball meatball for an appetizer.  The meatball and sauce were pretty flavorful, but the best part was the two slices of bread that came with the meatball. Toasted, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Good stuff.

We had reservations for 6:30 which we realized we didnt really need as it was not very busy for a Saturday night- I think we got a clue as to why as our evening progressed.
We were seated by a pleasant hostess and our order was taken by our server.  Our served seem knowledgable and offered some suggestions along the lines of what we were considering ordering.  We ordered another appetizer- the caprese which is not on the happy hour menu.  At the same time we ordered our entrees- a pasta dish for each of us.  

After waiting quite some time-again it wasn't very busy, the inside of the restaurant was practically empty- we began to wonder where our appetizer was when out came our entrees which were not brought to us by our server. I made mention that we had not received our appetizer.  Another employee came by and informed us there was no record of us ordering an appetizer and they sometimes have problems with the computer system. He offered to check on it and I told him we wanted the appetizer before our entrees- not after and to forget about the appetizer.  

The food was OK- I would probably rate the food a 3 or 3.5.  During our meal no one came by to check to see if we needed anything else.  Following our meal our server finally returned.  He didn't mention messing up the appetizer until we brought it up to him and then he made conflicting statements regarding if he heard us tell him we wanted it to begin with.

We will not be returning.  I think any reviews over 3 stars is fluke of a good day.  The lower ratings are much more accurate- especially for the service....and isn't that what going out to eat is- a service industry?We went here with a large group for a birthday party and the service was pretty good but the food left a lot to be desired. It was edible but far from good. My raviolis tasted like chef boyarde raviolis from a can, which I happen to like but not for the price they were charging.I've been to the Ahwatukee location many times and I absolutely love the food there. I stopped by the Cafe Boa on Mill (I don't actually think they are affiliated) to give it a try for lunch since it's not too far from my new job. The $9.95 lunch special is a great deal but the food was a little underwhelming. The beet salad had baby beets instead of large roasted beets so the flavor was lacking. Also huge pieces of apple that seems out of place with the other flavors and made the salad hard to eat. I also ordered the Proshoot panini which was not a panini at all but more like a wrap made with a thick flatbread. There was one thin slice of prosciutto and a small dollop of some kind of soft cheese and then the rest was arugula with a balsamic reduction. The arugula was the overpowering flavor which might not have been so bad if it were not also so prominent in the salad. I am glad I got my greens for the day but seriously it was too much.

I am sure I will be back, just because of the location and the pleasant atmosphere, so I may give them another star after trying some of the other items on the menu. Their pasta dishes all sound great.In Phoenix on Thursday on a courier run, and had to wait for the last flight of the evening to get home...so back to the magic Yelp mobile app to find Thai for dinner  that was close to transit...

Thai Basil looked to be favorable from the reviews, so I ventured to the restaurant.  From the outside, not too shabby.  3 cars in the lot and 1 person sitting on the curb eating from a take-out box so I figured it would not be busy.  On entering, I saw 3 tables seated.  The waitress met me at the door and asked where I would like to sit.  I replied in Thai that on the east side would be better, so I would not be next to a window with sun burning down.

Seated on the right side, she asked me if I would like water or another beverage.  I advised water would be great.  She put the menu in front of me and went to get water.  When she returned, I told her I was ready to order.  Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant and Jasmine rice.  Waitress asked me if I wanted spicy, 1-10 or Thai Hot 1-3.  I ordered Thai Hot 3, in great anticipation of a flavorful fire!

As I waited, I looked around the restaurant.  Tables were tight on the west side, with a long banquet bench against the west wall and 2-tops all the way along.  On the east side, 2 4-top round high tables and 2 6-top regular height tables appeared to have more space between them.  in looking at the floor, the corners and near the baseboards were quite dirty...and in looking up, there was a lot of dust on the fixtures and the vents.  I began to understand why someone would get food to go and sit on the curb in 115 degrees.

The salad and rice were presented to me in about 10 minutes.  What appeared to be a very large portion of papaya salad, about 3 cups, was an illusion.  The salad was placed on top of a pretty large amount of lettuce, which I did not see until I had taken a few bites of the salad.  I figure I actually had about 1 1/2 cups of papaya salad.

Spice was 5 (makes my nose run, while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  Disappointing since I ordered Thai Hot 3.  Waitress came to ask if I needed anything and I asked for lime and chili.  Both were brought quickly.  I doctored the order and worked my way through the papaya.  All the lettuce underneath was a disappointment.  Rice was wrong, overcooked to nearly mush.

Until they get the dust and dirt cleaned up, I am doubting that I will return.Good because it's local, and you can sit outside and smoke. However, it is also highly, highly overrated. There is nothing special about the food or beer selection, and the parking situation is almost always horrid despite a large private lot.

Worst of all, it is usually peopled by soft, pudgy ASU kids. It's the kind of place sophmores and juniors go to, saying, "wow! This is so college! I am so in college now! Look how college I am! I'm going to flip my baseball cap around and put on some flip flops!"

For a real hole-in-the-wall, find a hole-in-the-wall. Casey Moore's is a place that was a hole-in-the-wall and is now firmly ASU establishment - a good place to network with the future VPs of Dupont.If you want to be surrounded by young kids getting their kicks... be my guest... used to be a cool place and is no longer... I give it 2 stars because the bartenders are fast but have no personality whatsoever and and there is no ambiance at all to this place anymore... Plus the fact that they violate Arizona smoking law by allowing people to smoke within 20 feet of the entrances, INFACT lastnight there was someone smoking INSIDE the side door!!  
ALL I CAN SAY IS... DISSAPPOIONTED... NEVER AGAIN!!!Well, considering the fact that the busser picked up a napkin from the floor and put it back on my table, I'm a little concerned about their adherence to health codes....thanks for the good gin and tonic and service (from the server) but no thanks ... no matter how close to work this place is I'm not coming backI have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.

Until today!

I needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.
1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.
2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.
3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.

Zanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.

When I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer.Nothing is authentic here, too much cheese, beans and not much flavor. The chicken looks it has freezer burns,  no flavor because they boil it before putting if on the grillTalk about annoying - the wait staff, especially. No, it's not the service. It's the gimmicky, corny and self-humiliating "dances" they perform for their customers every few minutes. I guess eating mediocre food in peace isn't good enough. 

The disco, flashing lights come on. That's your warning. It's also a free headache, compliments of Joe's. Then, there's clapping, hooraying, twisting, turning to music like the Village People. Absurd. 

The food isn't that much better, either. Instead of a headache, you get to walk away with an upset stomach. Maybe it's the combo. Smile and nod. "Yes, I'd like to order the Bucket of Shrimp with the I Want to Puke Music and Dancing." 

So, why 2 stars? Beer. It's about beer - all about beer. Since it's Oct, everyone and their mother has a special pumpkin ale available. The one in the pic on the menu looked like the perfect mix to wash down bad service and even badder (yes, i said it) food. The waitress recommended Sam Adam's Oktoberfest instead. She brought me two huge samples of each... they probably both, together, made up a 1/2 pint! I was buzzed before I placed my order! 

She was right, though. Sam Adam's is what to order. 

I picked at my crab-stuffed shrimp, polished off the steamed veggies and washed the rice down with Oktoberfest that, almost, made the entire experience worth it. 

What i wouldn't give right now for another pint of Oktoberfest. (But I'll be damned if I'm going back to Joe's to get it.)What can I say, I have enjoyed other Joe's; BUT the wait staff seemed to feel is was more important to place the chairs on the table next to us and clean them as we ate. not the first time they have done this.....not the entertainment Joe's is known forThis place is just ok, which is really not ok for the price range.  The bruschetta appetizer is probably the best part.  I have never had anything there that really blew me away (unless you count the bill at the end).  The house salad is really poor.  I have had better at fast food places.  

When I went there the other day the service was really terrible.  Our glasses were all empty for most of the meal, and they seemed to be chatting to the regulars more than actually working.  

All this would be fine if it weren't for the price range.  If I am going to shell out $20 per person, I want really good service and better food!If the Diavola pizza wasn't good, I would have only left 1 star. I arrived with my dinner guest for a Friday night dinner at 8:15p.  It took the server 5-10 minutes to acknowledge us, and she was unprofessional and awkward. Instead of a hello, or welcome, I was greeted with "do you want to order, or can I get you drinks"? When we ordered our pizza, and she continued to suggest that we order a salad because the pizza would take awhile, I should have known I'd be in for a long night. By the time our order was placed, it was 8:25.  Our appetizer (aglio olio-standard, not awesome) came in a timely fashion. After eating the bread, drinking my drink, and thinking to myself "huh, its been a while"...I glanced at the time. It was 9:10.  I proceeded to watch a man at another table raise his hand for service, and hold it up for nearly 3m. It was 9:30 by the time my pizza came. An hour to bring out a pizza is outrageous. You only have one opportunity to make a first impression Classic Italian, and you lost me as a customer.I found water pooling around my fridge so went to Yelp for a recommendation. The fridge's 2-year warranty had just run out. 

A very nice guy came on the early side of the 2-hour window. He was professional and respectful. However he did not find the true problem behind a leaky fridge. He said it was plumbing--luckily I have a home warranty and the cost for a plumber to come out was only $60. The leaking continued so I had a second plumber come out at no charge. Both plumbers demonstrated how this couldn't be a plumbing issue--the pipe was dry. 

So I called E&J back and this time the guy did find a problem with the filter casing and replaced it.

But the fridge leaked a third time before it was (fingers crossed) really fixed. Apparently the root problem is using an off-market filter. I'd used off-market filters for the past two years so I'm not sure how true this is but whatever. I guess I'll enrich the Whirlpool Corporation by purchasing overpriced filters.

Still, I would have liked for this to have been discovered 3 weeks sooner. 

Note: no weekend or emergency service. The service charge to come out is $79 but this is also deducted from subsequent repairs.Service in the drive-thru was fast, but apparently these workers all speak limited English and cannot get the order right.  I asked for a 2-pc cinnabon meal. I got and paid for a 1-pc meal. Didnt notice until after we drove away,  because it was in a box and who pulls their stuff out while they are driving?I've been to quite a few 24 Hour Fitness gyms.  Yes, this has all the equipment you need for cardio and weights.  However, the gym is dirty.  Equipment is old, carpet coming up (being held down with duct tape!), and equipment is down for maintenance fairly regularly.   The biggest complaint I have about this gym?  The swimming pool!  On more than one occasion, I've seen floating debris, dead bugs and a build up of dirt in the pool.  It's literally stopped me from getting my morning swim in.  The staff is great, I don't have a single complaint.  With possibly the exception of the maintenance.   But, I'm more willing to bet it's not their fault, yet corporate ignoring requests.  This gym is in desperate need of help.  My 2 year membership expires soon.  Rather than enrolling again, if changes aren't made to this club, I will go to LA Fitness which has two locations 2 and 3 miles closer to home anyways.I have never really been impressed with Trader Joes. I find them to be over priced and lacking variety. I have had hit-or-miss luck with finding vegetarian options. I guess I might be happier if I were a meat eater.

Also, the produce selection is always really limited, at least the the Camelback Location.

Just my two cents.To be fair, the food is good, very good actually. But when a restaurant gives your food to another table and then continues serving to other tables while you wait a half hour it's impossible to give a decent rating. Won't return because there are lots of restaurants to choose from in this world... So why go to a place that blows off your order?I have been here on two different occasions, I was not impressed either time.  Almost didn't go back the second time, but thought I would give them a second chance.  Place was dirty both times, food was OK, no came to my table and didn't know that if I wanted a drink, it was serve yourself.  Maybe it wasn't serve yourself, but others did and there was no one around to stop them.  Will not be going back.had the bean burro. can't really mess up beans, but their hot sauce is too tomato-ey and not spicy enough.Not a  fan. Filabertos is definately a whole lot better and has better prices.Only ate here once.  The service was nothing to write home about.  The food is very lackluster--tastes like they buy all of their ingredients in the "Mexican" section at Restaurant Depot and throw them together to fool the gringos (whom, I might add, appear to be the ones here on Yelp who gush the most about the food).  Not "authentically Mexican" and not all that delicious.  Not the worst I've ever had . . . but don't go there believing the hype--you might be just as disappointed as we were.Waited for 20 for an average breakfast burrito. Average at best. Definitely nothing special about this place.I like the menu for Dennys however this particular Dennys is not that great. Whenever you go in on a week night, they understaff horribly and when we went there on a Friday, we waited 40 minutes for our food and we asked for an appetizer which arrived with our dinner. Also they don't seem to care to much about making sure drinks are filled or getting them to you in a timely manner (15 minute wait for drinks and when we asked for refills, it look longer or we had to ask them for the drinks again!). Sad to say, the manager running this place is pretty sleezy and when we complained to him at the end of our meal about the wait time, he said we should have come to him sooner about the issue. Since this has been the second time in a row this has happened, I doubt we will be going back to this Dennys.the place is a bit run down, and while hole in the wall places are usually great this one is just okay. Food is kinda meh, employee wasn't very friendly, and it all adds up to cost a chunk of change.Prices are way too high for the type of service you receive.. I live in Los Angeles and pay less than the $27 that this salon charged for a mani pedi...Meh, what can you say about Fry's...they have a huge selection of products, and that's really the only reason to shop here.  If another place has exactly what you need--go there.  But Fry's is a great place to browse if you're not sure what you need or other places don't have it.  The check-out line is always long (or worse).  Help varies greatly from very useful to completely useless.  If you're going to ask tech questions you have to already kind of know the products so you don't get sucked in by someone that is just spouting BS.  On the other hand they have a few people who really know what they are talking about and are happy to help.

The prices here are full retail, sometimes actually even more.  The sales can be useful, but for the most part are just what you'd pay online.  If I know what I want and can wait a day, Amazon Prime almost always is lower cost overall (with shipping).  Newegg kills their prices every time unless they have a major sale.This place is huge.  I came up to the store from Tucson.  The store has lots and lots of employee's but only a few of them seemed interested in helping us.  Great selection of everything with retail prices comparable to Amazon.  The soda machines were out of almost everything witch may be unforgivable in Tempe heat.  Parking is more than ample.Their prices are usually ok... But just had a poor customer service experience. We live about 15 miles from the store in Tempe, so I didn't want to make an unnecessary trip. I needed a replacement part for my Sony camcorder. It came with a two part charger, one part that has the box and plugs into the camera, the other that is just a cord that goes from your wall outlet to the charger box.  I was missing the second part so I called Frys (where we bought the camera to begin with) and I asked if they carry the cord I needed. She puts me on hold for about 5 minutes and comes back to rudely say, "We sell the whole charger set, we don't have random cords *just laying around*"  Well, I'm glad they don't leave their merchandise *just laying around* but whatever, I didn't need attitude for asking a simple question. I ask her how much they run, and she leaves me on hold for another 10 minutes before I lose patience and hang up. I called Radio Shack, and when I asked the same question, without ever having to put me on hold the gentleman on the line knew the answer to  my questions offhand. Not only did they sell just the specific cord I would need (as opposed to having to buy both parts) they also had a different style of universal charger if I preferred and he knew the prices of both immediately. I guess they appreciate their customers more there, so that's where I will go from know on!What happend?   We would order from here even when our Chicago friends and family came to visit.  Now it is a last resort because there are not many late delivery places in Gilbert.  They have messed up the last three orders and the quality went way down.  Management or staff needs to start paying attention.  Its giving a bad name for Chicago pizza.   Good luck.Our children grew up going to Il primos as a special treat and it was a place we took out-of-town guests to as a "must have." Not any more! 

The establishment moved locations a few months ago and they are now at 67th ave and bell road. They changed their menu, adding a full restaurant menu and unfortunately traded fantastic pizza for flat screen TV's. 

Their extra large pizza lost a few inches in size and what was once cheesy and delicious, is now flat and average. 

The two stars are for their wings. They kept those pretty yummy. 

Trying to decide whether or not to return. Sad day...Ok, the people reviewing this have to be employees because this store is terrible. I was happy to spot this place because I went to a few different Savers and they were so over priced but when I walked into value village the first thing that hit me was the smell of defecation but I held my breath and continued hoping to find a few good deals, HA they are even higher than savers, $499 for a used 42 inch t.v, I can go into Walmart and buy brand new with warranty in the box for $449. I needed a new set of dinner dishes they had a cheap set that once again can be bought at walmart for $29 their price $49 they had another set that was slightly nicer for $60. A dell computer tower for $99 but no way to hook it up to see if it works (not a chance)They had a large hutch that looked pretty nice but was not solid oak or anything and the woodwork was not intricate but it was nice, I was thinking tops $100... NOPE try $300. The shelves were dirty the floor was dirty and like I said the place stunk, stuff was just thrown anywhere with no organization. Savers may be overpriced but it is clean, well lit and no junk just thrown on shelves.I lived in Glendale my whole life since birth and I never been here at all, so recently I went and took a trip to see what it was about since my friend loves there mint chocolate. Everything was so cute and looks so vintage like you stepped through time and was beautiful. The smell just hits you as you walk into the door it was such a strong chocolate smell which is a plus for anyone who is in love with chocolate. I love everything about it and being my first time here I was excited to see all the things. My friend got what she needed as I was looking around there was a younger girl who was very helpful and nice she wanted to help anyway she could, which I liked and after grabbing a few things I went up to the line, now this is where my experience goes sour

I got up to the line and an older lady helped me check out she looked like she wasn't all too thrilled it seemed, and she was ringing up my order and ringed up a couple items wrong, the price I mean, and I told her that the price was wrong and she immediately told me I was wrong, she didn't even ask what sign did I see or anything she just immediately told me you are wrong and this is the right price and that's it, until I told her I didn't want the items anymore and I was going to go see the sign myself again which I did and after making a "fuss" about it she changed the price but continued to tell me that the higher price is actually right and she will correct the sign right away to the right price. I wasn't rude or anything to the lady I just accepted whatever she said to me. But being a customer I feel that it was poor service.

Other than that the whole place was cute and nice until the whole price being wrong ruined my experienced.From the looks of all the reviews maybe we ordered on an off night or ordered the wrong things. We did not have such a great experience. 

We got a menu on our door and decided to give this place a try. I placed a phone order and the lady taking my order sounded like she could care less if we were ordering from there. 

The food did arrive quick, the menu states allow 45 minutes but i think it got there in about 20, which caught us off guard. I was ::cough:: unavailable and the hubs was doing dishes when the door bell rang. He answered the door about a MINUTE after the door rang and the delivery guy flat out asked him if he was taking a nap! Kinda funny, kinda not. 

Hubs ordered some type of sandwich which he was immediately pissed off about. There was barely any meat on it, the bread was rock hard and it just looked like it had sat around all day. 

I ordered the Eggplant parm meal which came with some garlic toast and a side salad. The salad was very small and very old looking, wilted lettuce. The pasta was cooked, the sauce was ok, the eggplant was hard to find under the mountain of cheese, which lots of cheese is usually a good thing, but this cheese doesn't like to budge and was like a solid mass. 

Maybe after reading other reviews we will try something else but our first impression was less then stellar.Pedro's has been around for over 60 years, and tends to get rave reviews! I have tried it twice over the last year, and was underwhelmed each time. Hey, I may have been on an off day...twice. haha. Both times the food was mediocre at best. I am Mexican, so I may be basing their food off authentic mexican food, which this was not. Very true what other reviews have said, that the food was Americanized, but truly how can you make MEXICAN food American? The service was alright, but I almost felt rushed both times, how they drop the bill at the table. Also, after the drop off of food I felt like I had to chase down the server for more salsa. 

This is great for people who want a fairly cheap quick lunch, but not somewhere I will be returning to. I would much rather go right up the road to La Perla for authentic Mexican cuisine!I have had better I have had worse........I little to small for my taste everyone is really crammed in.Sucks that I had to give such a low rating! But my mom said so!! When my mother was visiting us from Cali last week, I brought her to see the light at Glendale. Now originally I was born in Glendale, but was raised in Long Beach! So when we drove by Pete's, my mom had me make a u-turn right to there location. She said as a child her and her sister use to come by all the time and loved it. She mentioned how large the fish use to be, and how good it was. Well, time has changed and she was very upset how bad it is now! The chicken tenders were OK, but the fish and shrimp was to greasy, and taste was lousy. Looks like another mom and pops place that just grew to large and forgot why they were their in the first place. Always happens when the kids and grand kids take over.We had to ask the staff  to cook the pizza more because some of the dough was uncooked. Not many costumers here at the moment and the place is really messy.  Tables need to be cleaned and the floors swept. I really enjoy peter piper pizza, but I really don't like this location.The food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. The five of us each got a different dish so we can have variety. The best was the eggs Benedict. Pumpkin pancakes had too much cinnamon. I got the corned beef hash which was over salted. Definitely prefer the corned beef hash at The Place. They had fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu but when we asked, we were told it was out of the box. I ordered a side of thick cut bacon which turned out to look like regular bacon. We were reassured that it was wider then the other bacon. I don't like this false advertising of menu items. The only saving grace was the mini muffins but I'm not sure if its worth a trip back. Maybe if I happen to be around the area.Great for a quick stop for a forgotten item on vacation. However, we went grocery shopping here and were disappointed by the limited fresh produce options. Their limes were bruised and discolored from being old and their prices were not worth the quality. We ended up going to Sprouts down the street and were much happier.First time in today. Flavor of the food was ok. Too much mayo in the macaroni salad so I didn't even bother finishing it. Aside from that all I ordered was the meal and a small drink. I got that and some crab rangoons when I got my food. Looked at the receipt and they didn't eveb charge me for the drink and just charged the rangoons instead. Most wouldnt't mind, but it's not what I ordered. More than likely won't ever go back. I'll make the 20 minute drive to Leo's on bell road instead. Much better flavor and they have homemade katsu and teriyaki sauce on hand.DQ is DQ..... what else can be said.

All I wanted was a dip cone.  I got my dip cone in a timely manner.  The place was clean, the employees were nice.  I was happy with my cone, but after all..... it is still just a DQ.Ordered a blizzard at the drive thru. They put lids in everything at this location and put the entire order in a bag, so you don't see your ice cream until you have left the window. My blizzard was underfilled, and runny, and not what I ordered.In a desert world even a muddy puddle  can be welcoming. So goes my feelings toward this Starbucks. I typically avoid Starbucks because of the burnt coffee and their franchise's political leanings. But sometimes they are the only place around. The wifi at this establishment was very bad, uncharacteristically so - it kept dropping every few minutes, streaming music or video was out of the question and IM was all but impossable. The service was fair at best, the coffee was as expected, and they began telling people to leave several minutes before their posted closing time. If in the area again...I WOULDN'T GO BACK.Went for dinner last night and when we arrived at 5:30pm there was only ONE car in the parking lot. I thought they were closed at first and when we figured out they were open I wondered if something had happened as I had never seen the parking lot that empty. We decided to go in and eat anyway.

We walked in and there was no one to greet us and I could see the help sitting in the back at a table chatting. We waited about 3 minutes before one of them got up and came and sat us. A short time later our waitress arrived and she was very grumpy as was the chip boy that gave us chips. Neither responded to my hello and thank you to them.

Our order was taken and we were brought our iced tea which had a very odd taste to it. Kinda of like dish water with a bit of sweetener in it. Neither my wife or I could drink it.

Dinner arrived and I can never figure out how this place expects you to eat their fajitas. They give you the platter of meat, peppers and onions and then a little tiny side plate with beans and rice. WHERE THE HECK TO i PUT MY TORTILLA TO FILL IT UP AND MAKE IT SO I CAN EAT IT? They need to give you another small plate but they never do.

We ordered and paid for a side order of beans and pico and both came in a little tiny cup. Smaller than the free salsa cups and I was disappointed I paid for a side that was so small. The pico tasted funny as well and not like it normally does when we have it at Raul and Theresas.

At the end of the meal we never seen our waitress again and finally had to walk up to the counter to get our ticket. 

The place was deserted and everyone was very grumpy. Food was ok minus the iced tea and pico tasting weird. Not an enjoyable night at a place we normally really like.

Hope things get back to normal or we're going to have to find a new place.Went in for a fill a couple of weeks after my full set and last review and not happy.  Nails were all crooked and I have a terrible fill line in my pink which I've rarely had in the several years I've been having my nails done.  Asked Ann to level out my tips and they are still crooked.  Will not be returning, actually removed them and am on the search once again.We had dinner in the old room next to the Bar area.  The food was fine but the service was pretty painful.  It was one of those dinners where to get the next thing we had to flag down our server or someone else.  I ordered a cocktail and waited almost 15 minutes for it to arrive.  We had to ask for bread and for the cocktail glass to be removed and for another wine glass to be brought and we had to ask for several other things as well.  It is hard to enjoy dinner and company when you are waving at servers all the time.The Tonto Bar and Grill use to be a favorite of mine when I was in the Carefree, AZ area, after tonight I'm not willing to make the drive from Goodyear to Cave Creek just to eat there.  As usual the food was great, but the service suffered as I've not experienced before. We were seated across from the door between the kitchen and the dining room where wait staff were constantly coming and going, but it gets better. At one point a waiter was entering the dining room from the kitchen with a plate in each hand, he kicked the kitchen door open so hard with his foot that the door sprung back and knocked one plate from his hand, which landed on the floor and broke splattering plate material and food. Shortly after, a second waiter came through the kitchen floor and slipped on whatever was on the floor (heavy Mexican tiles), landing on his bottom, and broke several more plates and splattering food which hit the back of my guests feet. My one guest was also hit on the backs of her legs with pieces of the broken plates (we picked up three large pieces of broken plate before leaving). Staff came over and apologized even though this was not their place, where was the owner or Manager? The young gentleman who fell apologized to us even though he should have been sent immediately to the urgent care since I'm sure he must have hurt something in the fall and he did admit that his elbow was quite sore, but he had work to finish.We live local and have been frequent diners  at the Tonto over last 3yrs. 
Unfortunately over the last 6 months the service and the quality of the food has been in a steady decline. I feel now is the time to share our concerns in hope that this will kick start an internal review by the managers/owners..

Our last visit on 3/16 was also my wife's birthday, it was a informal early unplanned dinner having also been out for a celebration dinner the day before.

The special was filet steak with bacon wrapped shrimp  which was the choice of the birthday girl.. The shrimp were very salty and the medium/well filet was as tough as old boots. As is customary with my wife she usually saves a little piece of filet for the favorite dog, in this case she had over 50% uneaten. Ahh I thought the dog in for a treat tonight - not so, not sure how it happened but we were discussing some of the old photos on the wall when our plates were whisked away by ones the table clearers, not even an offer of a " To Go" box.

As I said it has been a steady decline - most unfortunate as the Tonto was the Cave Creek hidden gem, perhaps it now needs to remain hidden for the wrong reasons...We go here frequently for the Sunday brunch. The gals at the hostess station are always confused and make such a big deal about seating & there are usually tons of open seats!!  Amazing!  We always do the self serve buffet & only need coffee & plates. You would think the seating would be a breeze, but there is a wait no matter how many people are there. You really need to train those girls. They are the first people that patrons have to see & need some customer service training and need some help!  
The food is always good. The place really needs some help and needs to step up the service!!!I bought a coupon for $59 to play at Orange Tree and Legend Trail a few months ago. I basically just bought it to play at Legend Trail and get the Orange Tree round as a bonus. 

First off, this course is a long drive away even from the Scottsdale Airpark area. I don't mind driving this far if the experience and or value makes up for it. This certainly wasn't the case at Legend Trail.

The driving range had minimal grass that hadn't been mowed in quite some time so it was basically like practicing out of thick rough and the balls are pretty seasoned. Then when I was practicing on the chipping green, a maintenance employee pulled the flags out that I was hitting at and started mowing right in front of me. I was a little annoyed but wasn't going to let it bother me much.

Playing my round, the course was in pretty bad shape. They probably had aerated a few weeks ago would be my guess so I can't really hold that against them.

What did annoy me though was that I was having the same issues repeatedly with maintenance staff not showing any etiquette. I had multiple greens I was hitting into from 100 yards or less and the staff would not turn off their weed whackers while I was hitting. One guy on a hole was standing 5 feet from the flag and even saw I was trying to hit and he didn't even move! There were three weed whackers going around one green while I was putting too. On another hole, I was standing over the ball to tee off and three maintenance carts drove right past me. I have never felt like such an inconvenience to staff at a golf course. I wouldn't even expect that at a course like Orange Tree.

Not sure what Shane S was referring to about management understanding customer service there. I went in the pro shop afterwards to ask for a manager and the employee informed me that he was gone for the day and asked why I needed one. When I told him I was upset about the maintenance staff, he sure couldn't have cared less. I filled out an online survey letting the course know about my experience and never heard back.

All in all, not worth the drive out there. If you want a nice golf course and don't mind spending money, go to Boulders or Grayhawk. If you want a nice course but are more price sensitive, then go to We Ko Pa. It's just as far away, almost the same price for residents, and a difference of night and day for course layout, amenities and customer service there.My husband remembered loving this place as a kid, so we went again. Fun looking atmosphere, but that's the best it gets. We had horrible service. It was a Monday night at 8pm. Looked Busy when we got there but most people were finishing up, so we were surprised by how poor the service was here. Food is ok but overpriced. Read on for details...

DRINKS: My husband ordered a margarita w/ No salt. Guess what, it came with salt. (Strike one). And it took 25 minutes for them to come cuz the ran out of triple sec (strike 2). Poor planning on them cuz the prickly pear margaritas were on special! It tasted good though and u would have ordered two except that the were small portions (wine glass portion) for 8 bucks.  Next I ordered a blue moon (one of the few "good" beer options) which came in a glass...not pint. Our server didn't even mention the size. At least they got the Orange wedge right.

FOOD: Grandpa ordered fried chicken and loved it. My husband and cousin got fajitas, I got sirloin streak, and other cousin got pork sandwich. The fajitas come on a sizzling plate with an extra plate of sides. Smelled and looked delicious, but by the time the tortillas arrived (we had to ask for them), there was no more sizzle and food was cold (Strike 3). Also they forgot to bring me my steak (STRIKE 4) so after everyone else's food came (except for tortillas) We had to wait about 7 mins for our server to return and ask if we needed anything. Finally, she brought out my steak and tortillas 10 mins after everyone's food arrived. Steak was cold cuz of the wait, but it was cooked perfectly how I liked it. Oh, watch out for the skimpy dinner salad, though. It's a cheap dole salad with only lettuce with barely any carrot and red cabbage shavings. Big disappointment.  

BILL: I was hopeful our server was smart enough to recognize the shitty service we had and offer up free dessert or something, but she wasn't that smart! We were charged full prices for everything. I pulled her aside and mentioned my frustration. Then she took off the tortillas and gave us dessert. This was her saving grace. 

Overall, they get one star for the bill compromise and one star for food taste. But service and prices were pretty bad.I recently had dinner at Cocomos and wasn't exactly disappointed, but I wasn't really pleased, either. I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and decor, but the food was lacking. It seems like I remember it being much better in the past, but now it's completely forgettable. 

We had the Nachos as an appetizer, which were good - how do you mess up nachos? I had the coconut shrimp, which was overcooked. The dipping sauce was supposed to be guacamole based, but it tasted mostly like sour cream so I skipped it. The veggies as the side order came out colder than the rest of the food, and were limp and mushy. The seasoning was overbearing, as all the flavor had been cooked out of the vegetables. One person had the cheeseburger, which they said was delicious, loaded with greens, and cooked perfectly to her order. Another person had the fish and chips, and the fish was over cooked and chewy. Both of them raved about the french fries. Another person had the catfish, which was over salted. It was served with rice, and for some reason I guess we were expecting white rice - but it came out with Mexican style fried rice - which just threw us off, I suppose. The menu just said "rice," though, so who knows. She had the same complaint about the veggies as I did. The last person order the Enchiladas Two Ways, which actually comes with three enchiladas. He said they were okay but nothing very special. 

It seems like they've trimmed their menu as I remember more items in the past - and they were delicious. Maybe they are focusing more on "bar food" type items, which is fine, but even those weren't executed very well. We all left full, but not satisfied. The service was mediocre...she was pleasant, but did the bare minimum to get by. The place wasn't that busy so I'm surprised she wasn't a little more attentive. 

I've been there later at night when it's a bar scene, and it's fine. Once again, nothing special. I've always seen a vast mix of different types of people there later at night - it always makes things interesting. There are plenty of places to eat that offer better food and service though - even if you're just looking for bar fare.Do you ever get that conspiracy theory moment where you think that a business is actually some sort of front for something much more sinister?

La Fondita is a little hole-in-the-wall mom and pop "restaurant" in beautiful down town El Mirage.  Please do not drive to downtown El Mirage based on my past sentence.  The "beautiful down town El Mirage" statement is what one might call sarcasm.  Remember when you were a kid, and you'd enter a neighborhood and your mom would tell you to lock the doors?  Now, you are picturing the beauty.  Moving on...

La Fondita is closed almost as much as it is open.  I drove by last Saturday at 8pm and they were closed.  

I usually just get my food to go from the little window.  The dining room, if we are calling it that, sort of makes you wonder if you have made the right choice eating there.

...but...why, oh, why would I go back?  I really, really like the food.

Some additional fun facts:

Once, the husband, ordered some sort of burro/burrito type thing that cost $4.95.  He asked for guacamole and sour cream.  When we went to pay he saw that he was charged $2.95 for the guacamole and $1.00 for the sour cream.  He almost doubled the price for his meal!  I laughed heartily.

When I went yesterday to pick up an order I discovered another comical sign... Due to increasing cost of fuel and paper products they are charging a $1 per take out order...for me to drive there and pick it up they are going to charge me an extra $1!  Lovely.

So...anyone know any good recipes for salsa?  It seems I need to learn to make my own.Slowwwwww service. Stopped here for breakfast on Sunday at 10am instead of stopping at a fast food joint.  Simple breakfast order took over 30 minutes.  You would think that the place would be prepared since Sunday is a busy travel day and popular for breakfast.Had an eye exam and a couple of pairs of glasses ordered from this location. The exam was thorough and professional. However, my problem was with the staff. You would think after spending almost $500, you'd be afforded good service.

Apparently, this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their non-medical staff. When I called to find out if my glasses were ready, the young lady I spoke to left me on hold for 25 minutes. I hung up the phone and called back. No apology, just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant. WTF??

The saving grace was the assistant manager (Stacy). I was pretty ticked when I showed up. She took control, fitted my glasses (two pairs) and wouldn't allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and I was satisfied that they fit perfectly. Kudos to this young lady .

Would I return? Hmm... Only if I can get service from this assistant manager.Me and my boyfriend went here to try out something new for dinner. After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to try the fish n chips for myself, because I am PICKY! PICKY! PICKY! when it comes to fish n chips. My b/f ordered the Texas Burger. So our order arrives and the food was piping hot (very good), HOWEVER.....the quality wasn't there. My fish n chips were so-so, they look like deep fried blocks/cubes of fish. It was dry and the tartar sauce was too mayonaiss-ie. The Texas burger was oddly shaped, (rectangular) and served on a sub style bread. The burger wasn't the best and the flavor was bland. I guess this place has a thing for square-ish looking food? Anyway, I've certainly had WAY better fish n chips in Rio Rancho, NM at Turtle Mountain Brewing Company :D 
As far as decor....it just plain sucks! very, very, very drab and outdated. It's bad enough dealing with flourescent lightning at work, but in a restaurant?? wtf! Everyone looked sallow and yellow. 
I would've gave it 1 star but I added the extra star because the check was easy on the wallet and I liked the iced tea lol :)Men's Wearhouse is a clean store with curteous clerks.  To bad they aren't diligent in their jobs.  Twice we've rented from them for events and each time there were numerous mistakes.  For the most recent event we had I ended up with scuffed shoes, no socks, and no suspenders.  My friends had numerous problems with their rentals as well.   

My best advice if you decide to use them is "renter beware" and make sure everyone for your event checks their rentals to make sure that they have everything and it all matches.  In their defense, Men's Wearhouse is very polite and apologetic about their mistakes but after two events where they got things wrong, giving them another chance is a tough sell.Food is a little bland , not much variety , go there for the coffee if your forced to kill some time.That chicken smells really good for lunch
The chicken is good but the staff is not very knowledgeable and have a bit of an attitude problem the place is always crowded in that order is never accurate I always have to send it back because it make lots of mistakes I don't know what's going on here but I would be cautious when you eating at this place.Had a bad experience at the subway across the parking lot so you notice I left one place came to this one right away much better better service I recommend this place for a much better service.The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!We had lunch here with the In-laws today. Highlights: the wait staff is awesome. Fast, friendly, fun; everyone here is ON it.
Lowlights: the food. It's not terrible, but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall. Weak coffee, white bread, smaller portions, nothing was particularly great. Nothing really sucked; but was just mediocre. They must be doing something right, it was crowded and my in-laws like it. I'd rather go without eating than visit here again.Flavorless...... Kung Pao Chicken is suppose to be spicy right? Well not here... and where's the chicken... had more peanuts than chicken. Egg roll tasted as if it had been in freezer forever. Soda was flat,rice was dry. Would not be so bad, but i was one of maybe two other customers.......Sad really.Gave two stars because my waitress was very nice.Waitress was miserable to deal with, very curt without any provocation. Not the best service, too bad, that is very important to me! Food was just okay, she didnt bring me what I ordered, but I didnt feel like putting up a fight in front of my elderly family during lunch.  Probably wont go againIt's just like any other Chinese place to me. The pork fried rice is ok, like any other place, except there were giant peices of scrambled egg that looked like fried eggs. 
The sesame chicken was not good; nothing to write home about. 
The potstickers were a bit too greasy. Although you get more meat or whatever is in the inside then at any other place.
I think they may deep-fry all their stuff in the same grease because sometimes you could taste a hint of shrimp. 
The egg rolls appear to me to be just like spring rolls that you can buy at Costco and over fried. 
The deliveryman was very, very nice. 
All in all, the food was too salty. 
But the place I love the best only does take-out, not delivery. I  will not order from here again.These guys have good BBQ, the only problem is they cook to their demographic so everything is over cooked, and they go light on their sauce on some and extremly heavy on many other items. Many bland items, but good happy hour specials and appitizers, and some good spicy bbq items.  Kind of pricy for what you get compared to others. Also the ditsy watresses would rather flit with guys in the back than ask you if you need a refill or something.(famous daves is way better) If I lived in sun city I would probably rate this establishment  with 4 or more stars but this young buck looks elsewhere for bbq delight. Texaz bbq or famous daves are much better choices.Been a member for over 5 years now and was incredibly inspired and motivated for the first 4. For the past year they started taping the services because we are such a large church and Pastor Don was being over worked, absolutely understandable. We didn't mind driving our 40 minutes to church, (great worship music) in order to only watch a video of our Pastor; we believed it to be temporary. The message was always inspirational and delivered something redeeming, so we continued going. So when they dropped in Pastor Mark  one Sunday as the "teaching Pastor" it was a surprise. Didn't know if he temporary or what, only knew that he was in fact coming to us live. As weekly church goers it occurred to us although Pastor Mark was a man of God, he did not have the same gifting of Pastor Don and it was clear there was going to be a trade off.-but at least we had a Pastor in person. Fast forward; the last 2 services we attended we watched Pastor Mark coming to us taped on the big screen Rather disappointing when all things considered we could stream live my brother -law's message from the pulpit in California while saving ourselves an hour and a half commute time. The entire church  has grown so large and expanded that it feels to have fragmented the church. It's just odd sitting there now with half the people filling the seats watching a video. Not what I believed church planting was supposed to actually be. Although we are tithing and still consider this our home church, it doesn't feel like home. It makes me sad.Nice campus... Great live music... But the pastor preaches on pre taped video which is distributed to their various locations around town... My family found the experience a tad strange. 

To be more efficient next week I  am going to pull out my guitar at home and sing some songs with the family and watch Joel Osteen on TV.I would give this place two to two and one half stars. My family has eaten here a few times and overall it seems to be about average. Fajitas usually have too much black pepper and the tortillas are too thick. The chips and salsa are good. Service is hit and miss and the kid's meals are a bit expensive. There are better and worse Mexican food restaurants to eat at in Phoenix.Food here used to be good!  Now our last visit, we were sat at a booth that we had to wipe the seat first, the wall surrounding us looked as if it had not been cleaned in quite some time (the dead fly on the window sill confirmed this).  The wait staff not to professional, I know we live in Arizona but I prefer not to look at the butt cheeks of waitresses hanging out as I am eating, they really need to go to a pant uniform instead of those shorts.  Free chips and salsa, um they have gone to using these small bowls that barely fit a handful in them and they were gone before we received our drinks.  The cheese crisp has been reduced to might as well not waste your money portion size and last 2 times here have had to send it back as I told the waitress I ordered a cheese crisp not a burnt crisp.  Food comes out and is blah, my taco shell is hard and tastes stale, her enchilada is so blah she eats a quarter of it and we bring it home and threw it to the dogs to eat.  Their was a time I was so unhappy before leaving at the hostess desk I spoke to the so called manager on duty, he seemed as if I was interrupting his busy time which consisted of not doing much.  I told him of that bad experience and he made no real attempt to make it right just stood shaking his head, ( probably figured he already had our money your bothering me just go away), well I told you then another bad experience and I will not be back so not only will I not be back but I am writing this review and making sure to tell everyone I know of your restaraunt and it being in their best interest to steer clear.My parents took me here when I was visiting them in AZ.  I think they love the fact that the beers are cheap...which is nice.  But, I thought the food was fair.  My burger was greasy and over-cooked.  I think the fact that they serve the burgers on paper plates is fine but the place is just DIRTY - I didn't even want to think about the kitchen.  If you go here, DONT even go in the bathrooms - they are totally gross!I would LOVE to buy this place. I've been here 4 times and if the burgers and root beer weren't here, neither would I be! Our food was great! Staff speaks Spanish to each other. Disgusting ceiling fans!!!! Restrooms needed attention. And NO air condition. Today was 80 degrees. It has such potential. So sad  great location large place, good parking, but apparently a owner/management problem.Where to begin...

We went to le Bistro one evening and the hostess was RUDE! She asked if we had reservations and while the place was rather empty (it didn't fill up) she tried to make us sit at the bar.  We waited quite awhile for a crumpled up piece of paper known as their "Wine List"...I opted for water at this point.  We ordered and our food arrived..when I asked for more bread with our dinner she ignored me!!

Chicken Parm...not bad not great...it was really tender but also very soggy. I am more a fan of crispy Chicken Parm..but this is just my choice.
The spicy sausage and pasta was very yummy and had a bite not TOO spicy..it was great

Where it gets uncomfortable and the reason I will not return is the fact that the OWNER was DRUNK and flirting with girls very very VERY LOUDLY. He kept demanding his staff "make him money" and "get shots over now". It was so loud and obnoxious I just wanted my bill and to get out of there. He eventually talked his female friends to go to another bar I took note of where they went and did not follow. 

Food wasn't bad but the OWNER of all people should stay away from this place if he's wasted..he should have been mortified of his actions...We ate there at the recommendation of a local. My salmon was good, nothing outstanding, but good. My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and it was terrible. It rated as one of the 3 worst spaghetti and meatballs that he has ever had and he orders it a lot when we go Italian. The meatballs were too heavily spiced with basal. I tasted it also and was glad I hadn't ordered it. He also smelled of garlic for at least 3 days. The service was good and the décor is quaint, but I would not recommend it for the food.It had nice clean sheets and the mattress  was plastic wrapped ... Positives
The smokey smell is pretty bad .
Very old fashioned , like a step back in time . 
Unique place .... Not really my normal place I would stay , but the price is so low it's almost unheard of . Also the cafe had very low prices for big portions.
Just know that you will not be getting the Ritz but I don't think the Ritz charges $45.00Update. Im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for. Please. After a few times i get the picture.Crappy cashier stood and stared at me instead of greeting me. Place was full of redneck-types and whatnot too. I only went here because we needed to stop by the post office before getting some food in the morning, and now I've learned my lesson.Went to Johnny Mac's for the first time yesterday after my husband raved about it. I love pizza so of course that is what we ordered along with wings (hot), fries and homemade garlic bread. I am not a wings person so I didnt try them but they definitely smelled hot! The fries were good (shoestring). The pizza was ok...I wouldnt go back just for the pizza. We had a party of 10 and did receive decent service. They include gratuity in the bill which was fine. All and all...I live in the aliante area and will not be traveling all the way over here just to have lunch or dinner. It was just OK.For $4.50 / matinee ticket, my wife says that I shouldn't bitch, but I'm going to anyway. The seats are smaller than a coach seat on a little commuter plane; the theater only holds about two dozen people, and it becomes very crowded, very quickly. The volume is set a little too low to overcome the sound of all of those candy wrappers, all that breathing, and the general susurration of any crowd of people. 

The "mix-and-match" candy bins, though - HELL YES I love that.This one is actually for the take out joint next to the bar in the back, called the pigskin snack and sports bar. Was driving around in the area seeing if there was any hidden gems in this area. Saw they sign that advertised "25 cent chicken wings". Couldn't pass this one up. Wish I did.

Chicken wings - when i ordered them the guy at the snack bar said "ok, hold on for a second while I grab them for you" I was thinking "oh no, they've been probably been sitting under a heat lamp few hours". And that is exactly how they tasted. What was even worse was that they had a slight woody smell. That's a sign that the vessel that was holding the wings hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. Ate 2 of 8 of them, against my better judgement. Threw the rest away. Yea, they were that bad. I gave them an extra star because I didn't spend too much money, like 2 bucks for 8 wings but you could get better stuff at a walmart, which says a lot.Only 1 person in front of me, and you end up waiting for 20 mins for a regular 5.00 pizza...Expensive. Pedicure was about 15 minutes. I had to actually ask to get my cuticles cut. Won't go backI was excited about this restaurant because I could get a bowl of pho without having to drive across town. The pho is good but the service is terrible. Delivery time is over an hour so I decided to pick up the next time. I ordered two pho and 1 order of egg rolls. I left my house 10 minutes after I ordered thinking it would be ready by the time I drove up there. But I was wrong. When I got there not only was my order not ready. I don't even think she put it in. Also she told me that there was only enough pho for one order something she could have told me over the phone before I drove up there. So I waited in there hot restaurant for another twenty minute just to receive half my order. I was not offered anything for free to make up for their mistake.Food was greasy. It was hot in there and service was ok. Food was alright. I give them ONE whopping "bleh" star and ANOTHER as a thank you for the free egg roll upon checking-in through Yelp. :-pSorry. But we will not be coming here anymore.  And this is why.....

1) There was a party of loud drunk older women screaming every 2 seconds!!!  Please it is only Applebee's. Not a club. 

2) Happy hour has different drink specials.  Not impressed. We would have drank more  but drinks tasted weak and watered down    Changed cup size on hubby's beer and is even more expensive. 

3)  They must have a new cook. Food is not like it used to be.  We all ordered stuff with fries and there were like 5 pieces of fries on each plate. Really!  Fries are cheap!!!  Salad was over dressed and too much croutons.  My son had a piece of lettuce core in his salad. Come on. Quality control!!!  Why would you serve me trash?

We do really appreciate the girls who served us were really nice especially since we had to deal with the drunks interrupting our meal. Jason was awesome and gave us a discount for having to deal with that crap the whole meal. Good looking out for your other paying customers!!!  That's the only reason they got the 2 stars. 

Some advice?  Fix your food ASAP!  We used to come on a weekly basis but this may have been the last time. :-(This place needs a serious expansion.  They should take lessons from SFO on how to upgrade an outdated airport.  You'd think the government in LV/Nevada would see these huge hotels being built on the Strip and say "Wow, maybe it's time to really spend some money on the airport instead of making rinky dink changes."

The traffic sucks ass, to the point where the cab driver, to save time, basically drops you off in the parking garage, making you hike literally the better part of a mile to the ticket counter, only to double back to get through security and then take a train to get to the concourse.

Ain't gonna change anytime soon, as the Las Vegas real estate market is going to make their tax base smaller than Carrot Top's capacity for humor.

Not one cool restaurant to be found here....Chili's To Go was the creme de la creme....At least it wasn't an Applebee's (but aren't they all owned by the same corporation these days?  Cheap microwaved food for everyone!)+ The D gate area has a bunch of Starbucks', which is right up my alley.
+ There's this awesome store that sells south western shit, and I got an awesome figurine of a Jackalope. They also had Jackalope salt and pepper shakers. I almost bought my friend a dream catcher, but I figured I could find those anywhere. You have no idea how stoked I was about the Jackalope stuff, that turned this rating from 1 star to 2. I wish they had a chupacabre figurine to go along as a set.

- Everything else.
- Cheapest thing to eat here is $10, wah
- Had the grossest cheeseburger of my life at Ruby's, which was 10 bucks. They asked me if I wanted fries and a drink, but as I'm not a millionaire, I declined.Impressions of a large airport in bat country.

- Where the hell are the flight monitors?
- stainless steel stools for computer users.
- Sbarro is your best bet for chow.
- more crowded than airports in some airports Asia (reminds me of Kai Tak).  I mean it's really crowded.
- bad signage (there are a lot of signs with an arrows on them that don't describe what they're pointing at)
- dark, dingy like a bus station.

+ i remember it smelling worse last time I was here
+ the slot machines are quieter
+ the air conditioning is strong
+ Classic Rokk instead of muzak (but a little heavy on the Van Hagar)
+ Free wifi (so I can register my disgust)

McCarran also garners praise for its easy access from the Strip and for infrequent delays due to the usually good weather.Blows. BLOWS!!!!

The shuttle shit is so weird. As are the roped-off snaking security lines that have never been clearly labeled as long as I have been flying in and out of this airport, which is now approaching the 10-year mark. 
Bud Light is $8.00. 
A Wendy's value meal is $9.95. Okay, how about just the sandwich? $7.50. WHAT? Okay how about something off the dollar menu? $2.99. DUMB. 
Flights - across the board, not airline-specific - are routinely cancelled with no explanation and many employees are slack-jawed, dead-eyed and disillusioned. 
During my THREE HOUR reassignment to another flight I sipped a $9.50 Jack/Coke and watched a man migrate from slot machine to slot machine, not once getting so much as a cherry payout.Whoever said Vegas never closes, sleeps, etc; it does. We had a delayed flight and ended up here at about 11:30pm on a Monday night and nothing food wise was open, absolutely nothing....not to mention we must have walked close to 1/2 a mile to make the connecting flight. You don't always get to pick your connecting flights when purchasing airline tix so, for getting us home in one piece it was just fine. 
We did get to fly home with the Pacific Tigers Women's field hockey team; that was the hi light of the airport experience for me ; )The worst airport I've ever been to. There was only about one screen displaying flight statuses in a waiting area. There is a lack of anything to do (nothing to look at, no where to walk, not many places to eat, etc.)There is no other place on earth like the Las Vegas airport.  Everyone arriving is happy and trying to take everything in like it's their first day out in the real world.  How full of hope they are.  Landing in the Las Vegas airport gives a sense of expansiveness even though the place is dangerously full of people.  Leaving the Las Vegas airport is another story.  People tend to stare at their shoes in shame from whatever event is never to spoken again.  Or people are way too happy because they won fifteen bucks on video slots and scored a free drink.  Winner and loser alike are crammed into winding line where TSA are more handsy than homecoming dates.

While waiting at the gate there are more slot and video poker machines incase you have any spare cash you'd love to piss away.  To be honest if it came down to putting money in an airport slot machine or getting an airport quesadilla, the slot machine wins every time.  At lease the slot machine won't give me diarrhea.  

I'm always glad to go to Vegas to meet up with old friends and I'm always happy to leave the neon nightmare.Eeeeesh. I think I've been spoiled with San Diego & San Jose. 

The bathrooms here are nasty! There was this brown rust/goop trail from the hole in the sinks. Not enough seating. It looks so groddy!!!

You'd think they'd give the place an upgrade with it being so busy. Wouldn't the monies from the slot machines help?! I KNOW I LOST 14 BUCKS ON THE STAR WARS SLOTS :(This airport is a work of art. It was carefully crafted and constructed to embody the entire Las Vegas experience. And of course, resemble a Vegas style hook up. Remember, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, unless it's herpes. That's the gift that keeps on giving.

When you arrive, the airport is a full fledged casino that is bubbling with energy and features plenty of space, slick and shiny slot machines, decent restaurants, an upbeat crowd that looks fresh and beautiful and put together, and a smiling staff ready to welcome you to the party. It all makes the quite the impression and you fall quickly for the superficial charms.

But when leave, the airport is a full fledged dump that is lathered in depression and features tight quarters, outdated slot machines, less than desirable fast food joints, an exhausted crowd is falling apart at the seams and running on fumes, and a grumpy staff that is quick to show you the door. It all leaves quite the impression and you grow to hate the superficial charms you once fell for.

It is reminiscent of a Las Vegas style hook up where someone uses you for the night and then kicks you out before you can pass out in their room. You end up enduring the walk of the shame at 6 A.M., hungover, tired, and with the desert sun beating down on you. You feel like a dying vampire and the sun makes you want to kill yourself before your face melts off. Oh wait. That last part happens when you take the drug called "Charlie Sheen."

Anyway, that pretty much is a Vegas style hook up. Well, at least that's what my friend told me from his hook up experiences in Vegas. But he doesn't have herpes. No really, I swear.Inefficient gateways. Need to shuttle everywhere. Slow security checkpoint lines.Its an airport so there isnt much difference from one to another but I am writing one short little two star review cause this airport does not post which airlines are at which terminals. So if you dont check ahead of time (which I never remember to do) you just end up riding around looking for your airline terminal. Thats LAME!You would think for being in Vegas that this airport would be as the same as the strip.
Has horrible areas to eat at while waiting for your flight and please, please turn on some air freaking humid...As soon as you get off the plane, the sound of slot machines warmly welcome you to the City of Sin where all bets are off, no rules, all fun.  Welcome to the place where an adult can be a kid.  Make your way through the glitzy airport, grab your bags, and do... whatever you please in Las Vegas.  The city is your oyster!

But when you head back to catch your flight back home (most likely broke) make sure you keep your eyes away from the slots to avoid being tempted to spend your last $1 on a broken dream.  

IMHO, they could really do a nice renovation of Terminal 2... Us Hawaiians need some snazzy, impressive displays of Vegas glam, too!  Just sayin'...The people that work here are rude! SFO definitely way better.So-so.  The things I like about this airport:  good transportation options that are easy to find; security lines are usually not too bad even when there are a ton of people; free wi-fi; slot machines!   But there are so many things that are poor/gross about this place:  everything looks/feels grimy; smells like cigarette smoke; poor food options; overcrowded gates with too little seating.As if losing all your money on the strip from gambling, expensive restaurants, and pricey shopping didn't hurt enough...you leave Las Vegas through a neglected airport with filthy bathrooms, poor dining options and limited seating. I know it is just a port of entry/departure but dang, couldn't the hotels chip in a tiny bit to make a good impression for travelers?  I added one bonus star for their no - smoking enforcement.Oddly smells like popcorn..but in that "covering up a smell" bad way.Seems like I am always on Southwest when going through LAS, and that terminal is the worst.  The food options range from awful to disgusting.  The security lines are long (but do seem to be improving). I try to avoid this airport like the plague - but alas have another trip to LV upcoming...ugh.Trams back and forth are not fun.  Not enough security to run people through efficiently. LAX, and SLC are much better.  And the Delta check in here is freaking ridiculous I mean seriously they have flights stacked every ten minutes and nowhere near enough help. even when we checked in online the night before.  Seriously only two people to check in luggage. Could use restrooms closer to trams.Picked up a friend at the airport.  The signs were confusing and downright contradictory in some cases, and we got routed to the international terminal instead of the domestic one.  Im sure my experience on the inside of the airport will be better next time, but they need to fix the signs so Im not driving around like a idiot.  Also, Im an idiot.The TSA can, if they choose, treat people with basic respect. 

At this Airport these flashlight cops make you hate flying. It does not have to be this way. SFO and OAK are friendly and efficient with out being mean.The line to get a cab here is FREAKING RIDICULOUS.

It's like a maze of ropes --literally walking from one end of the airport to the other end.. and then doing it again. maybe like 4x???? 

I stood there; and honestly was able to memorize people's shoes to match with their outfits. Yah. the wait was that long; i had to create a game in my head to keep me entertained.
You can't help but see them over and over and OVER again.

So if you're going in the summer.. make sure you wear comfortable shoes if you have to take a cab....there's going to be a lot of walking to get a cab if there's a line.
wear sunscreen, have some water handy, have a facial spray mist..and learn to breathe.

Also if you're going carrying a heavy duffle back?? don't do it.. get those rollies.Southwest Airlines does have convenient flights times but the service is mediocre most of the time. Firstly, my husband and I checked in online at the same time but got different boarding groups - one in A and one in B. When we proceed to board together at the gate as coupDoesn't make any sense to make a couple traveling togetherFlew from LAS to BUF would most likely not use them again.  Did not care for the boarding process we were in group B and got stuck at the very rear of the plane in front of toilets(gross).  Happened again on our return flight even though we checked in early.  Felt  crammed in like cattle.  Very rough flight into BUF--pilot did good job  keeping us updated on weather.  Will probably spend more next time for more comfortable flight.  FA's were friendly and generous with snacks.Just my luck, when I got there they had updated the software on their computer systems and delayed everyone from getting their cars for an hour.

Service is standard, but what I was surprised about was when I returned the car with 7/8 full tank.  They filled it up to the top and charged their price per gallon which was over the typical price at the time.  Gotta love Alamo...Out of the apple cinnamon bagels, when asked if they would bake more, they said "not today".More like 2.5 stars. You don't necessarily go to Vegas to get your fix of japanese/hawaiian fare especially coming from LA. But here we ended up because we were in the area and needed a break from the other grub on the Strip.

Located in the California Hotel and Casino, this is a usual stomping ground for those wanting chicken/beef teriyaki, rice, spam musubi, saimin, or hawaiian mac salad.
If you've never had any of these, well, this place might not be a good place to get your first impression. Everything was way overdone except maybe the saimin. 

Service is friendly though and prices aren't bad. Bummed.I was ok with this place for a while. The food is ok for the value. 

However, lately management is really not doing his job. Orders take forever to be served when there is literally no one in the restaurant (25-30min) and overall, customer service is getting worse.

Today I went for late lunch with colleagues. We had the discomfort of being present in a verbal fight between Joe (I guess THE Joe) and one of the cooks. What a shame. They were arguing in the middle of the super small dinning room! .

The one thing that really ground my gears thou was that I order a spaghetti with meatballs and after waiting for half  an hour I got my plate with no meatballs. After a couple of minutes the server brought me a cup with 1 meatball. "Ill bring you the other one in a couple of minutes", he said. Five minutes later, with my plate almost finished, he brings me the other sad meatball in a small cup. I guess it was some kind of deconstructed italian cooking experiment...Had lunch here today with the wife.  Food was ok, not spectacular but not the worst I've had.   My taco was a bit greasy but the shredded beef was well seasoned.   The wife had an enchilada and said the sauce was tasty.  Beans and rice were both very good.  My biggest complaint was the service - marginal, at best.  The waiter seemed annoyed by my request for an extra napkin and our glasses never got refilled.  I'm usually a good tipper, but that guy got a measly $1 from me on a $25 ticket.  On the plus side, the food only took about 10 minutes to arrive once ordered.Unbelievably overrated. This place is way over priced.  $17 for a left over recooked carne asada burrito plate. Located in not so desirable neighborhood. Stay clear!!! The quality of food is sub par.   They are trying to get hotel prices in a ghetto neighborhood. I'm sorry...but I will never return.  They charge $4.25 for microwave tamales.... :(Um yeah, so I've worked in restaurants my entire working life and tonight I've witnessed a few fundamental health code violations. Our water was poured from the tap straight from a hand sink in the back into our glasses.  The hand soap from said sink was located directly over a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of water. The server washed out a horchata/lemonade pitcher in that very same sink--which you're not supposed to do. Those sinks are for hand washing only. I saw a busser bus tables then go cook on the line. Did he wash his hands or just wipe them on his extremely dirty apron. Seriously it looked like he was butchering meat. Unfortunately we were seated near the line where the servers pick up the food. They were horsing and joking around to the point we thought they had been drinking. It was really inappropriate. In keeping with the drunk theme, my server literally laughed at me when I ordered a cheese tamale. He apologized, maybe he was thinking of something else but it was really rude. On a positive note, the food didn't suck.  I actually wouldn't mind food poisoning; I could really stand to  lose a pound or two. Hence the two stars.*The following is an update of my last update.  Another Yelp reviewer recently sent me a PM due to her curiosity as to why I didn't do or say anything about my experience at The Cal (while I was still a guest there), as well as in regards to what I'd suggest the hotel could've done to make my stay more satisfactory.  This is an excerpt from my reply to her.*

There's a few aspects of my review that I didn't mention because I thought they were obvious, would be redundant and/or would represent more of a chaotic rambling rather than a concise summary.  But apparently not, so... here they are:

1.  Without fail, I heard housekeeping doing their rounds prior to noon. The only reason why I mentioned them was because of all the noises I heard, they were the loudest.

2.  I stayed at a few other hotels in LV since last December, and I've never encountered a roach before - and a huge one at that.  Not sure how this could be remedied, since if there's one - there's definitely more!

3.  My roomie really didn't have issues with the room's "deficiences" the same way I did.  In fact, he already had super low expectations of The Cal, expectations that even I thought were too harsh (he also doesn't have a roach phobia, and the used bath water from the clogged tub barely reached his ankles and therefore wasn't too bothersome. I'm about a foot shorter than him).  Also, the room was under both our names but reserved by him.  So anything I reported would've ultimately fallen on him rather than me.

4.  The number of luggage/belongings I mentioned are only my things.  My roomie had a very big carry-on at the beginning of the trip and, like me, accumulated more things as the trip went on.  The idea of getting Bellhop to assist with transporting our things from one tower to another sounds like a good idea, but you've forgotten about tipping.  I would feel compelled to tip and - quite honestly - that's not something I'm thrilled about since I wouldn't have had to tip in the first place if the room had already been decent.  Having maintenance fix the problem with the clogged bathroom also sounds like a good idea, but if for some reason we couldn't change rooms before then, I would feel compelled to actually remain in the room while said person was checking up on it, which could be hours.  It's kind of like asking a repairman to come to your house to fix something... usually, you'd stay at home while he's doing it because you really can't say for sure if he'd steal something or even be able to / earnestly try to fix the problem.I definitely like this place because it makes me feel like I am back home on Oahu, but our room wasn't the best... I mean, I guess I shouldn't have expected a lot because I only paid about $39 for the night.... The thing that disgusted me was our shower had a lot of mold in it, and I am not referring to just one spot. There was a few spots... I have e-mailed the hotel and I am waiting to hear back from them...I love the Cal with everything I've got. I've been staying here at least once (and usually twice) a year since I turned 21, and we've even made it a family tradition to meet here for Thanksgiving. I'm a Hawaii girl, and this is the closest I can get to home without flying all that way.

It breaks my heart to have to give this two stars, but I don't have any other choice. We checked in today only to find our thermostat broken. It would only blow cold air. Even after it reached its set temperature, it continued to blow cold air rather than turning off. Even if you had it at the hottest setting and the room was frigid, it would only blow cold air.

We called the front desk who said they'd send up an engineer. 45 minutes later, the engineer came up (I have to note here that he was the nicest, most polite guy) and said there was no quick fix (he'd have to cut a hole in the ceiling), so we could either have only cold air or only hot air blowing. We asked the front desk to be transferred to another room and were told that they only had smoking rooms available. On both calls, we spoke with the same person (didn't catch her name), and she wasn't apologetic. She even seemed annoyed that we were bothering her.

We decided to go down there and speak with the front desk face to face thinking they might be nicer to us if they had to look at us. We were told again that there were no other rooms available. We asked again--surely there was SOMETHING else they could do. Surely our only option wasn't to be uncomfortable for the whole weekend, to be hot or cold or surrounded by cigarette smell. The girl we spoke to, Christina, was very sweet but had just started and didn't seem to know what she could do. She wasn't the person we spoke with on the phone. She enlisted the help of two other employees (neither of whom spoke to us or even made eye contact as they came over to assist) and although they said again (count them, this is the third time) that they could only give us a smoking room, they were magically able to produce a non-smoking room with a working AC unit on the fourth look in the system. (And they only took this fourth look after we asked if we could stay in a room in another of their properties in the area.)

Throughout this ordeal, ONLY ONE person (the engineer) apologized for the inconvenience. Seriously? Guys, you're in the service industry. This didn't need to be a big deal. Your poor handling of the situation made it a big deal.

I feel so let down.Over the phone customer service was shit. The cooks and the cashier looked unhappy but the food was game which I won't lie about. I called earlier wanting to ask if they had delivery. No answer. Called again and no answer. I called again just in case (cause who the eff knows if they're ignoring me or maybe someone happened to call before me). Finally this douchebag answers and responds to me by telling me that he knows that I'm the one that's annoyingly calling him (as if I'm prank calling him or something) and hangs up. Despite the fact that I felt under the weather, my ass wanted pizza so I drove there (not to get revenge), but to see if I get the same respect that I received over the phone. The cashier was on top of the customers, and so was one of the cooks (he cooks near the window... he looks like a New Yorker but I could be wrong). The other guy... I remember his voice... The douchebag on the phone. He was doing his job, but didn't show as much initiative as the other cook. He was just there watching the clock. No judgement here. Just upset. If you don't like your job, then don't take it out on other people. If I'm wrong, then why are you such an asshole? If it wasn't for this guy, I would have probably given it a 4 star.Eh.  Just eh.  The papusas are decent.  The chips and salsa have to have been store bought....and who the hell puts a "cell phone store" inside of a restaurant?  Hello, ghetto!They need to learn the basic of cooking and season their beef with salt.   Do not waste money or time.  I ordered the Chaeuteaubriand and it was so unflavored I had to soak it in the sauce to eat it.  My daughter ordered chicken and barely could eat two bites before saying I am done with this dish.  This place was not blowing your socks away or being pampered type of place.   4 Queens will also charge for parking even if u valet.   Be warned.  Overrated restaurant.I should have trusted my instincts.  I love the romance of old Vegas and thought we should try dinner downtown one night.  Hugo's Cellar seemed to be the nicest, most highly reviewed place I could find.

Looked at the menu while I was home making plans and had my heart set on chateaubriand - just love a good filet with bearnaise no matter what chefs think of the cut - and looked forward to it.

Was given a red rose upon entering...not my thing...too cheesy for me but I took it (and left it on the table).

After ordering, the salad cart was wheeled over and our salads were created.  Old school salads, nothing frou-frou here and teeney-tiney shrimp.  I made the mistake of filling up on it too much since we were famished upon entering, so much so that I was full when my entree was served. 

It was okay but nothing like I was hoping it would be.  Portions were large so come hungry.  

This was too old-fashioned for me with mediocre food.  I realize I sound like an idiot saying I'm looking for classic Vegas and being picky when it's old-fashioned, but Hugo's Cellar didn't provide the scrumptious meal I was hoping to have.I have been going to Hugo's for the last 20 years. It was my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas for that period. We went last Friday April 29th and were very disappointed in the food and service. All four meals were delivered cold so we sent them back then they reheated them and it was well done when served the second time. We made the mistake of not complaining again and ate the meals, but should have sent them back and left. I suppose any place can have an off night, but it was very disappointing for Hugo's to have one. Hopefully something did not chance permanently, we will try it one more time. The drinks were and the bartender were still great.
