They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.Do NOT. I repeat - do not do business with this company. 

We purchased a furnace with an extended warranty. The warranty was for 650.00 and we were told it would cover any defects, issues etc. Within 2 years the blower motor went out on a Friday. They advised us it would be 198.00 per hour since it was overtime. This was at 3pm on a Friday. They told me to read the fine print..... you know the drill. Finally after much run around I was told we would have a man out for no charge Monday morning at 8am. Of course no one showed up. after 3 more calls and missed times finally we had a tech arrive at 12noon. They do NOT do what they say, they are rude, and not the least bit proactive. Beware of any promises the sales persons make and any comittments the company makes.Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!
I've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.

I know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and ratingDoes anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:

1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.

2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)

Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that.The only reason I put one star is because I had to. One of the poorest managed and run motels that I have ever seen. The rooms were very sub-par with mold on the bathroom ceiling. There were crumbs in the bed and they weren't very clean.

The rooms' walls were very thin and you could hear everything that went on from people stomping around upstairs to listening to doors banging constantly. There was a ton  of noise from these places as well as the highway running parallel to the hotel as well as adjoining rooms.

Management was the worst of all. Horrible at enforcing the rules so other guests can be very discourteous as well as riff raff running around outside peeking into locked vehicles almost as if they were trying to find a way to break in. Head manager is very hard to understand as he doesn't speak English clearly with no common sense on how to run a business.

Overall, one of the poorest run hotels I have seen in a long time and for the money, many other choices in the area which provide way better service and accommodations. So overall, easy to make a better choice anywhere else. Beware.This place is awful.  

Drinks are way overpriced and weaker than a popcorn fart.

The place is filthy inside and smells like a old, sweaty jock strap.

Staff is slower than molasses and you'd see the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl before you get served.

Always a testicle festival.  No hot single chicks here.  

Rather buy a 12 pack of Ultra and spend my Friday night under a bridge.

Go Packers!!!!!!Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.

I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open "sometimes" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. 

Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. 

Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.This place makes me nervous just thinking about going there.
I have officially decided I am never going back here again. I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.
It's that bad.
Not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:
1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.
2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!
3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.
4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!
5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.
6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.
7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be "checked out" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.
8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.

Oh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.
If Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.
It's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.
Please, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.Terrible service.Pretty bad. They have recently changed the name. Seems like a good place to go downtown, but both times I have been were terrible experiences. 
Incredibly poor service by the bar staff and servers. I thought the first time might be a fluke but the second time proved worse. Food was nothing more than mediocre both times. If you HAVE to go, DO NOT order the artichoke dip. Absolutely terrible.Another review of AT&T wireless....not the store.  This may be a record; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me!  After 12 years w/Verizon I decided to leave so I could get an iPhone.  GIANT mistake.  I called to activate my phone, and was told the activation dept. is CLOSED.  I called customer service, and got it connected.  But then I called Mom and she asked why I was calling from her cell phone number?  They got the numbers attached to the WRONG PHONES.  So I called customer service back, and THEY WERE CLOSED.  It was 7pm here.  I dont care what time it was on the east coast...if their customer service dept (and tech support) cant be open when i need them, then i dont need them.  I'm going back to Verizon and im never leaving again!This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:
Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada 
Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.
Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.
The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.
This place sux!
Beer is good.Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food. 
My party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating.Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting!
How hard is it to make a blended drink?
Sorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up.Went here yesterday.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, side of beans and drink for me to eat there. Beans had chunks of what tasted like dehydrated dried onion in them and they were not hydrated. Sandwich bun was totally soggy and pork was dry. Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days. Spent $20.00 on a small amount and food and this is what we got. Try https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barbecue-Company-Grill-Cafe/100123416554
The Barbecue Company instead.  Their food and customer service are both great. Honey Bear's you lost a customer. BBQ Company is only open Mon-Fri until 3:00pm but worth the visit.  Once a month they have a buffet!This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.
NO "i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long." Nothing.
I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his "manager" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  
There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. 
I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....
Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. 
Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.
                                    Thanks for nothing, 
                                                       Augustina AKA ROBBEDSo after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.What is the hubub over China Chili?!?! Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!?

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!

First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.

For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!

The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. 

The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!

The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!

Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.

If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!Don't go to this store if you are looking for 45s. They give you a book to look through and ask you to tell them what you want and tell you the prices will be $4 upwards. They then price them up using various price guides. If you have found something that is priced highly they hide it then put it on Ebay rather than sell it to you. You do all the work (the books have a total of more than 300 pages) and they reap the benefits. If I hadn't had picked out a certain $300 record that record could have lain there forever. I wasn't even offered it at any price and I would have given them a good price.Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. 

The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.Terrible service from the manager Dave at this marshalls location. I tried to return something and he literally yelled at me and belittled me in front of a line full of customers for not having everything I needed to return the items. Get the hell over yourself! It blows my mind that the customer service at these establishments are so terrible considering how much competition there is in this day and age!

Not only was he rude to me but also to the woman that was trying to help me do my return. Will never shop at this location or let anyone I care about give there money to this shitty store.I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business...The store manager is lazy, rude and unhelpful. Same with the assistant manager Charlie. I feel really bad for the reps who have to work under such poor management.  I got no help from anyone when it was clearly a problem caused by someone at that store.  The manager refused to take me off speakerphone even when it was obvious that the echo in his tiny, depressing office was making it impossible to communicate. GO TO THE ARCADIA STORE AT THOMAS AND 44TH. MUCH BETTER!! BOYCOTT THE CAMELBACK STORE!It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!I was driving by looking for a place for lunch and I stopped in, hoping for some deli food. 

I was quite surprised to see that it's actually an old-school cafeteria. I didn't know that these places existed anymore and I was ready to be charmed.  Alas, that was not to be.

Although I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.

Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.

I see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like. 

It's also not particularly cheap.  My prison plate was $9.73 with the tax.  Not recommended.worst brunch I ever had!

I was hoping for a nice Sunday brunch but was very disappointed. The waitress told us that it is a fourty minutes wait for any order. She suggested pastry even though the cafe was less than one third full (12 people including us).  So we selected two crossants, a quiche and two cups of coffee. Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. 

Halfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.

 I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.  We asked her if there was anything we could have done differently to have a proper meal and she said no. 

The worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way. 

Will not go there ever again!Bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days. Brie was expensive and the worst tasting I've ever had.Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:

I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.

American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.

Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:

She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! "Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?" I asked. She looked back and asked where. "There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim." "Yes". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. "No," she replied. "My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me." She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.

Needless to say, I won't be coming back.Against my better judgment, I went to Pat Murphy's again. I mean, it's right around the corner from my house and they have Smithwicks on tap. Plus, my friends were going for karaoke and I hadn't seen them in awhile.

Still a dump. Still lame. Still hate it.I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said "order here." I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.

Now this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some "person" walked out from the back. I left.

If the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria.I will never go to this place ever again! The day after my nails were done they looked like I'd had them on for over a week and my cuticles looked horrible! At every other nail place trimming up the cuticles are a part of the service. NOT AT THIS PLACE! It costs an additional $5! Not only did they refuse to fix them but they refused to give me my money back and were extremely rude!! The guy that works in there had the nerve to yell at me! I will never go back to this place again! I am going to stick to 7 day nail and spa in Tempe Marketplace!This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's "Chicago style" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie "coma" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a 
windy city day buckaroo.I had experienced first hand why it's not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk, and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch. After finally getting around to getting it fixed, I contacted The Watch Repair Company:

12/12/09: I call the shop asking about a price quote and ETA on when it would be fixed. I'm told it would be $20, and it would be finished Wednesday (12/16/09).

12/23/09: Almost a week after I was told the watch would be fixed I call the shop. I am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day (12/24/09, a.k.a. Christmas Eve). Surprised that he would work on Christmas Eve, I am told the watch would be ready between 1-2pm. 

12/24/09 3:01 PM: I call the shop, and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by 4:30. Frustrated I let him know I would be there at that time.

After The Watch Repair Company had fallen through twice, I was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed. The only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand, mumbling  in sort of a primitive way. No matter, I was especially excited to have my watch back.

12/24/09 4:30 PM: I walk into the shop and let him know I am there to pick up my watch. He pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling "I got it cleared on out, I can give you a call when the crystal comes in," and hands me the same exact thing I had given him two weeks ago. The crystal was still cracked. After all that, nothing had been done. I am completely speechless, grab the watch, and head for the door. He mumbles "There's no charge on that."

I still have no Idea what to say. What a complete waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business.Pretentious and overrated.

This is the kind of restaurant for people who a) miss New York, or b) don't know what they're talking about.  This is the kind of restaurant where you'll pay $200 for $100 worth of food.  It's not that it's bad, it's that it's pretentious.  To pay this kind of money is a strip shopping center is...overrated.

Yes, the owner-hostess it's just not worth it.  Very snooty to other patrons she deemed unworthy, save the money, go elsewhere.My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. 
I ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!I have been going to this place for over 35 years.  I am originally from Joliet, Il where is was called Aurelio's (owned by a different relative).  I was ecstatic to find this place 16 years ago when I moved to AZ.  I frequently visit the restuarant as well as order out.  The pizza is very good.  Just yesterday I ordered my pizza like I always do (my favorite super six) (even though it only has five toppings) and asked to hold the peppers.  To my surprise when I picked it up they charged me extra for HOLDING the green peppers.  They will not hold an ingredient on a special pizza.  What they do is charge you for the basic pizza with adding for each ingredient.  I was appalled to think that I would pay more for less ingredients.  I quickly refused the pizza and walked out.  The manager quickly followed me out to the car who proceeded to argue with me that they had a change in policy and that is how they do it.  He was clueless and felt that it was fair to charge more for less ingredients.  I quickly advised that they have just lost a long time customer and that I will not be returning.  Believe me I will not be returning.  Where is the family business I used to know......Ugh, so slow, and not friendly, they could care less if they have your business, and the food shows it.Went to Wendy's on 7th St. and Greenway for breakfast with my wife. They opened at 7. We were there when the doors were open. Two gentleman were ahead of us. The restaurant had approx 8 employees.we stood for five minutes, the employees totally ignored us, one of the men left. The other asked if someone could help him, a employee looked at him, didn't say a thing, turned her back and walked away! The shift Manager looked at as and said," we'll be with you in a minute" Five more minutes went by and all the employees, and the shift manager still ignored us! We left! I eat at Wendy's all over the valley and generally the service is fast. Not at this location. The owners just went through a complete rebuild of the location and it looks great, but the service before the rebuild was horrible and that didn't seem to change, in fact it was the worse service I've ever had anywhere. If you are the owners of this location please do something about your poor attitudes of your employees and your management staff. Attitude is everything and it starts at the top.Would give this joke of a salon 0 stars if at all possible.  Stylist quoted me a price that magically doubled when finally arriving at the Salon.  The stylist was 30 min late to the appointment we made over the phone.  Called and spoke to the manager who showed no interest or concern in my disappointment.  She spoke in a condescending rude tone.  Avoid this place like the plague.Horrible service!!! Don't ask for them to quote you a price before your grooming service. They will quote you low and then give you the "but once you get here the groomer will let you know what it will be for sure".... Once I arrived they originally quoted me $47 and the groomer said NO its going to be $83.... ? Never will I take my pets here again!!!!!!New owners New Menu Blah blah 

I used a restaurant.com coupon and wish I hadn't. 

Dumpy, bad service, worst food. 

3 kids and myself for dinner during the week, 

I had the steak, a nice rib eye ...BARF 
IT WAS ABOUT 1/4 INCH THICK, GREY IN COLOR, NO SEASONING, AND 2 GRILL MARKS (SERIOUSLY 2) IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS BOILED. 

I SENT IT BACK (VERY UNUSUAL OF ME) 

I went with the ribs, which were Gray and boiled tasting too but the sauce was good and I was done! 

She sucked at refilling water, it spilled everywhere when she did and she never mentioned any kind of discount or anything. 

2 kids want wings, which were on special for $0.35 each IF you buy drinks @ 1.75 each. (waitress proceeds to tell me this is CHEAPER then buying the wing plate. 

1.75x 2 = 3.50 
12 @ 0.35 = 4.20 
total 7.70 for 12 wings and 2 kids hopped up on Dr Pepper. 

I ordered the 5.50 for 12 wings. and 2 waters. 

PS Wings were good. 

Kid #2 got fish... it was greasy and chewy, she didn't even eat all. 

The salads we OK the dressings were OK. 

Don't bother unless it is the bar your are after, at least the bar girl was cute.POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Called to get a price for one print job, and the guy who answered the phone interrupted me three times to quote prices before hearing the details of the print job. Needless to say, his first two quotes were less than half what the correct price for the job. They would not have honored the first two quotes. The guy was rude even when I thanked him for his help.THANK YOU! 
Finally WONDERFUL Italian food ... Yumm & double yumm!!!

That was last year.  And it was true. Wonderful warm welcoming feeling, wonderful food, wonderful service. And very understanding and cooperative toward my wife, who is blind. Even to the point of standing on a chair to direct and adjust the available light to best serve my wife. 
All in all quite impressive and worth the 5 * I gave it. 

But that was last year.  I don't know what happened, maybe they were sold, but this year was entirely different. No warm vibe, no welcoming feeling, totally empty, music and tv blaring, some staff person sitting at the bar texting, waiter says: this is the best lit table (it was pretty dark), I request the table were the guy adjusted the lights, he say I can't do that and it never happened, no one would do such a thing. And the woman at the bar chirps in that I don't know what I'm talking about.
Nasty nasty nasty - especially to a blind person. 
I wouldn't put anything in my mouth made in that hostile place. Stay away!Ran through their drive through last Thursday. The employee working the window seemed to speak english perfectly but kept asking me to repeat the order. (it happens so whatever, thought nothing of it despite the fact I only ordered one item).

After the 3rd time, he said "pull up". I pulled up to the window and had my card ready but was surprised to see said employee chatting away on his cell phone. He didn't say anything to me, not even my total and because I was dumb enough to have my cc ready in my hand out the window, he yoinked it and promptly charged it and continued chatting away on his cell phone IN FRONT OF ME.

I'm a cell phone whore just as much as the next person but I have the decency to know when and where this is appropriate. THIS WAS NOT THE TIME/PLACE, DUHHH much???

I stared down said employee thinking "surely, he MUST be getting off the phone to actually, ya know, provide SERVICE?" He eventually walked into the back out of sight, still never having said ANYTHING, not even "you want salsa?".

At least when I go across the street to Filiberto's, they have the decency to 1) give me a bloody freaking total and 2) ask me if I want some fu***** hot sauce. 

I'm not expecting a 5 star level of service (I'm realistic, not stupid) but stuff like this makes me want to shove cell phones up the employee's  noses. 

I won't be back.I advise not avoiding Phoenix pediatrics. The waiting room smells like cigarettes and walls & floor are very dirty. They are consistently running at least 45 minutes behind and when you finally see a doctor, he/she spends less than one minute with you.They need to fire that bitch Ashleigh. ...I did not tip you today because of the stuck up bitch attitude you had with me & with the mother and her sons before me.The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C... Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.I hate this airport, friendliest my ASS! From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers, this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to. I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way. I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole. Yup, sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa. Umm, Lufthansa... why do you code share with this abomination of an airline? Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place. PHX? BOO!Terrible airline operations, incompetent TSA.  You're better off flying in to ABQ and driving.I like to stay at Hilton Hotels, because I have an expectation for accommodations that are a little more upscale.  Well, skip this one.  In all the hotels I've stayed in this was the WORST mattress.  Didn't sleep at all.  I would have been better off going out to my car for sleep.  The room was what you'd expect in a less expensive place....old thin linens, furniture that needed to be replaced badly.  Then there was the restaurant.  I'd traveled all day and decided to go pick up a sandwich at the restaurant.  I figured they could do the least amount of damage to a club sandwich.  I got to my room....couldn't even eat it.  The white bread (not toasted, but totally dried out was also MOLDY.  There was no mayo on it, not that I would have eaten it if there was.  Yuk.  I fly out of Sky Harbor often, but will NOT try this hotel again!!Tried to call in order. Girl who answered the phone seemed lost and requested we be place on hold. (Hold as in place on counter and left to hear their personal conversations for over 5mins) Another women picked up seemed even more confused than the first on what we trying to do (how hard is we'd like to place a to go order). Finally gave up hung up on them and called our normal place just down the street from them. So much for trying something new.I have a similar story about Advanced Auto Service.

Went in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works.

I politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on.

He even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful.Service is fine. quality of food has fallen significantlyHigh prices, poor selection, and awful customer service. These are the reasons I chose not to register at Babies R Us in the first place. When l received BRU products at my shower and had no use for them I tried returning to the store. I did not have a gift receipt nor a gift registry so I was told they couldn't do anything for me. I was stuck with products I didn't need. Really? Is this how you treat your customers? The cashier admitted that each item was currently on the shelves but she had no way of "matching them up" against a receipt or registry. She even suggested that I try returning them to Walmart because their return policy is very lax. I was disgusted and offended. I was doing the right thing by taking the products back to the store from which they came. Even Target allows you to return things without a receipt. I'll never buy anything at BRU.Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime. 

We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds. 

The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible. 

When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat. 

Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki! 

Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order. 
This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night! 
The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night. 

My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a 
damn big mac. WTF! 

The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it. 

Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but "have a nice day"! 

*vomits*My son made reservations for Mother' s day for our family and specifically requested handicapped accessible  seating.  Upon arrival we found we were seated  upstairs,  not on the main level by the handicapped entrance.  When I asked the location of the elevator I was told they don't have one..."it called legs".  (not a good response for an Iraq veteran in a wheelchair).  After being told to go back outside and up the main entrance to the upper level we found the seating involved steps.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training.I came here after a car accident - I had smashed my head into the door panel and was having issues with memory and major migraines. Dr. Hetrick saw me once, then kept referring me to his PA - although she was nice, it really caught me off guard when she refused to prescribe certain medication because she hadn't had experience with it... So she would only prescribe meds she was used to, then told me to go see another doctor for everything else. After being overly drugged with nortriptolyne and topamax and having an adverse reaction to both, Dr.Hetrick's staff got overly pushy with Botox (for me it felt like they wanted me to get it so they could get a big payday rather than because it would actually help me). After I refused the botox Dr.Hetrick basically told me that he couldn't help me and that I need to go see someone else (like their acupuncture guy down the hall). I ended up switching Neurologists altogether and finally found one who was able to help - I ended up getting nerve blocks for several months which made my migraines go away completely. 

This story gets better - back in April I got a call from the billing office (Rose) who told me I owed some astronomical amount of money, so I referred her to my lawyer (who's handling my car accident claim). I thought everything was taken care of until I got a very unpleasant call from Rose just a few minutes ago telling me that she was sending me to collections. I asked her if she had spoken to my lawyer and she said that she lost her number... Super unprofessional. 

Either way - if you already suffer from headaches - you may want to avoid this additional one and find a neurologist who cares about your health and has a competent billing office.Although I usually love Target, this location is always lacking. The staff is rude and the baby section is tiny! They never seem to have anything in stock and when you ask them they grumble and tell you "everything's on the floor" always.
Everything is always on the floor? HmmmThis UPS location prominently advertises its printing services. Upon printing a shipping label, I was inexplicably charged $2.50 because the file was on a thumb drive, requiring the employee to spend an extra 20 seconds to retrieve it. No mention was made of this absurd charge prior to printing. I'll give it a solitary star, because it is conveniently located.死八婆  made me wait 30 minutes for some pan fried noodles and fried rice.So I've been to this restaurant 3 times just to make sure it wasn't me that was being rude or a jerk. 

So to start off the food is just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad, but the pricing is high for the things here, I can get it at any other Korean restaurant for way less.

So here's is why I gave the place a one star.... The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied "for what?"....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out 

So for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent.What a crap experience !  Get someone who listens and speaks clearly to work the drive through!  Hope that idiot working there tonight enjoys that job because Jack in the box is about as good as he will get!I thought I did enough research before I had Lodi install my garage doors.  The sales part of it was pretty good. I guess i assumed too much ,  in thinking that my sales rep would at least try and match the door to the color of my entire house.... Installation was ok too....  although the auto door opener was mounted on the wall...and wired to the motor in a very "elementary " fashion to say the least....just sort of wrapped the wire around piping and draped across the ceiling.   No biggie. But I had problems with the keypad mounted outside...will not take the programming.  I had the repair rep out....  could not make it work ....he said it was a discontinued model, ( or something like that?)  He would look into it?  After hearing nothing I called back again...they want $85.00 for a service call?????  I explained the situation to the guy that answered....he said" $85.00 and we will come look at it.   No wonder they gave me a "good price" on the door opener that i bought?????  So NO outside keypad i guess.    I will NOT have them back !!!if you want garage door service dont call these guys.  purchased two garage door openers, went out of my way to make sure they had all the information about my doors, delt with a guy named jay, called him couple times giving him information including the fact they were 8' doors, service guy shows up says i can't do your doors no one told me they were 8' doors, i say ok when can you do them can you go get the hardware, he says no i'm too busy i have no idea when i can come back you'll have to call scheduling. give me a break, thanks but no thanks i'll take my business elsewhere suggest you do the same..................Customer service is nonexistent here.  Employees are not friendly at all.  Bagels were good, but not worth the lack I found personality from the employees.  Second visit w/ my family of 4.  Not a difficult order and not a busy time.  Next time we'll drive further to go to Bagel Nosh, Brueggers, or another Einstein on Val Vista where hopefully the employees will be less robotic.Maaan I'm not puttin No stars up, Ya'll close at 10 but giving me food at 9 looking like 10. Service Bad at this one, damn how many times do I gotta ask for breadsticks & water refill. Food looks like sum1 made it outta a box, shoot I could've made this, don't say I shouldve that's not the point, I come for 1 thing, it don't matter what time of day or Nyt food should look & taste the same....Olive Garden is good but Boo this one!!!  Skip my server also Craig, took his sweet ass time...smh....I guess I gotta put 1 dumbass star....the review was blank for a reason!Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the "manager" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless.Installed a hot water system for me and botched the job. Terrible time getting them to repair their shoddy workmanship. The workers don't speak English. Use extreme caution when using this company. They hide  their poor reputation at Home Depot and screw up their good name to boot. I would not recommend delta mechanical.I just recieved HORRIBLE customer service at this store.  I went to purchase a Netbook for school.  My husband gave me his card and took mine because his account had the money in it.  I was able to swipe the card and push credit before I was ever asked for ID, then was told if I had the pin number to that card I would be able to use it but since I did not I couldn't.  To me that is suggesting credit card fraud without implicating themselves.  I left.  I went home and placed the order online, put it in my name, and set it for in store pick up.  Because the store was closing in 10 minutes I hauled butt out of the house and left my ID but had the printed reciept, with my homework on the back (I recycle).  I also had the card used for purchase, a debit card with my name, my android phone with the bestbuy emails confirming my order, my checking account reciept, and many other ways to prove I am who I am.  (Not to mention the sales associates who had helped me minutes before).  I seriously doubt, at 9 pm, someone is going to know I placed that order, come to my house and steel the reciept, and go to best buy all in a timespan of 10 minutes, but whatever.  I also told them they could look up my best buy reward zone account and I would verrify every product purchased and what store they were purchased at.  This was not happening.  I got a little irate...I had been at this for hours, been to different locations, and now was being told that after I spent hundreds of dollars with them I could not have my item. Before I ever got rude, just a little loud, I was told that my behavior would not be tollerated.  I said this is why I hate best buy no customer service.  He told me he could easily cancel my order and I could spend my money somewhere else.  REALLY??? REALLY??? They then called mall security and the cops. That is when I started cussing.  So this is how they treat the people who keep their business alive. Circut City didn't do too well...any business can fail.  Best Buy has never honored our warenties, have never been nice after we spent money with them until we were ready to spend more,  geek squad messed up my desk top so bad that even the CIS and Electronics professors at my college could not fix it (after geeksquad tried to charge me to fix their mistake)...this was the LAST straw.  I am completely done.This place has the best wings! My fav is the honey hot. I've been going here for years. A year and a half ago, I moved to California and whenever I come back to Arizona I have to stop by for my wings. Today, I go thru the drive thru and order 2 orders of the honey hot, headed back to the freeway because we're heading home and realize that we only got one order. We had to turn around, go back to complain and the girl that took our order tells us that she only charged us for one, then if the fact that they charge a "convince" fee for using a card isn't bad enough, they want to charge us it again when they inconvenienced me. I mean, come on... Take an accurate order. Do your job! Plus she went and got the owner and he was a jerk. Talking over us and arguing with us. They have lost my business. Making a mistake on an order is forgivable but having poor customer service is unacceptable.Where to start with this RAG, "The Arizona Repulsive" ??

They are the worst example of an alleged newspaper.  The Accounting practices are the worst, including FRAUD by the accounting department.  Yes, FRAUD.  When confronted with that, they never denied it.

If you don't get a paper today, you will NOT get it today... tomorrow "IF" you are lucky.

ALL employees in the "Customer NO Service" department are outright liars.  Every stinking one of them.  In one phone call, if you speak to  several people, you will get a different answer from each and everyone of them.  Call back, same subject, same runaround, different lies.  Guaranteed !

Another thing, their alleged "New" website is a 100% rip-off of the USA Today !!  How easy that was, "New and Improved", sure.

After you cancel, if you are lucky enough for someone to get that, they will sell your name and phone number to telemarketers.  Now, you are faced with getting rid of them.

Don't waste your time and precious money on this bird cage liner.

Actually their score should be minus 10 or worse..Middle of the road service & taste.  Weird, cold atmosphere in lounge.  Pricey for quality.  I saw Schwan's trucks in the back & checked menu... It's what they serve!Amidst a sea of chain restaurants along a seemingly endless row of strip malls, I expected this little Mom & Pop to at least try to compete. We should have stopped at the complimentary chips and salsa because everything we actually paid for was bland... even the service!the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, call it Orange Chicken, and my coworkers will back weekly!(see Ben V.'s review)  I ordered delivery one time and was grossed out enough that I ended up throwing everything away after the first bite.  I eventually implemented a rule that we would no longer provide business to this restaurant after a terrible call we received from them.  Our company would order delivery almost weekly and would always throw quite a bit of money at this business.. Furthermore the tip would always be VERY generous.  Until one day we left a tip of... (please play dramatic countdown piano riff in your head here) 10 DOLLARS!  AHHHHHH!!! With the next order that was placed, the business contacted us to complain of the size of our tip, stating they weren't sure if they could deliver our current order if we are only going to tip blah blah blah.  Thats right, they complained about only getting a 10 dollar tip for the delivery. (the bill was only about 40-50 dollars) .  You are far better off sticking to local joints that are not only delicious but are grateful for your business. (TOTT's, dragon express, etc....)I was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure. It bled and stung and was not pretty. I was compensated by a 10% discount.(?) This is not how I would do business if I wanted to retain a brand new customer whom I just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle. Ouch! good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels. Horrible service!i have been here twice once for breakfast and once for dinner. the breakfast was  average. For dinner i had enchiladas and taco it was the worst mexican food i have ever had. the sauce tasted like the dollar store sauce and the enchilada had green olives on it, you dont put green olives on that kind of food.  the silverware was dirty and there were flys buzzing  all around.  the waitress was ok , but i won't be going back.AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Seem to employ under-experienced groomers, has poor, very poor customer service.... they couldn't even call me when my pet was done because they never asked me for my information let alone any record of my dog's last vaccinations! I would NOT TRUST AARDBARK GROOMERS!!!!!Not overally impressed with the quality of the lunch here. Food was average at best. They actually brought the wrong burger to my wife and instead of fixing it like a great establishment would, they simply brought her the extra toppings. Lame.Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!Wow, I have never received worse customer service than here.  Set up a tee time for a saturday morning round of gold with some buddies from college.  It had rained all week and was raining the morning of our reservation and was about 40 degrees at 6 am.  I wore a collared shirt and blue jeans due to the cold.  Mind you, I understand the need for a dress code at nice golf courses to keep the riff raff out.  My jeans were presentable, my shirt was a nice polo, and NOWHERE on the website does it state no denim, only the need for a collared shirt. When I arrived, I met Mike, who is the cashier at the clubhouse.  From the second I walked in the door, Mike started harrasing me about my jeans, telling me I could not play yet would still have to pay because of the 24 hour cancellation policy.  Mike was extremely rude and unwilling to have a rational discussion about the "unposted"dress policy. 10 fays later, they charged my credit card I had used to reserve the time for $240 which I disputed.  I, for one, will never golf here again although I have played at Johnson Ranch several times while in school.  The course is average.  First nine holes can be found anywhere for less money, back nine is nice although all the building of houses has diminished its appeal. If you value any type of customer service for your hard earned money, look elsewhere.  Superstition Springs is much nicer for the price in my opinion.Worst nail experience I've ever had!  He cut them shorter then they should have been cut and  I asked for "squareish" cut on my nails, so they'd be rounded on edges, but there was no rounding.  After I had paid, before he put polish on them, I said they still needed to be rounded and he said it was too late....and he meant it!  My pedicure left me with skin hanging off two toes - not trimmed well.  Very little interaction with me during the hour I was there and the tools didn't look clean.  I will never return...and would advise you go elsewhere if you want quality work!Worst gel manicure I have ever had.  She destroyed my nails when taking the polish off.  She clipped my skin and then smiled at me.  And the next day the polish was literally peeling off.  Bad service + bad results = bad review.  I was hoping to like it since it is in the neighborhood.I would NOT recommend this Pets Mart to take your dog for a grooming. I have a West Highland White Terrier and took him in for a traditional Westie cut. He came back with a "cocker" cut, not a Westie cut and looked ridiculous. I took him a few days later to another groomer and they asked me "Who did this?" I told him Pets Mart, North Scottsdale and they said that he was not groomed to the breed standard and that his "genital" area and arm pits were not done to regulation and it was not sanitary!! Will not be going back there. I think their employees need better training. They don't seem professional to me at all.1stars...is all they get. I used this dry cleaner about 4yrs ago...my pants weren't cleaned well and they flat pressed them. Last Friday I decided to try them again (times are tough & they're cheap). I asked the guy to plz make sure they creased my slacks...not flat press. Well today I picked my order up and sure enough all 3 pair were flat pressed!!! It ticked me off bcz of course I asked for creased...but besides I wanted to put another pair in for cleaning.  The guys said they were sorry-the kid I put my order in with was suppose to tag my slacks "crease". 

Well I did put in another pair of slacks today; the new guys said they would tag them crease.

I'll see how the slacks come out tomorrow.  

After tomorrow I will exclusively use Z cleaners. Z cleaners is very pricey...but they always do a phenomenal job...and you dont have to request your slacks to be creased.

Also there is a (I believe) a $0.50 charge for debit/credit...not a big deal...just thought you should knowAVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!  I went to this dentist because his office is located very close to where I live.  Keep in mind, I'm in my 30's.  Never had a cavity in my life.  NOBODY in my family has cavities.  Up until my visit to this guy, my teeth were perfect.  

He uses this sonar wand thing that detects 'microcavities' that have yet to show up on an xray and tells me that my teeth are perfect EXCEPT for these 'microcavities'.  He scares the daylights out of me by telling me that unless I get 10 'microfillings' in my 'microcavities' they will be full blown cavities within 6 months.  Alarmed by this prediction, I set up an appointment to get 4 of these 'microfillings' put into 3 of my teeth immediately with the intention of getting the rest of my mouth done later.  I go in to get my teeth drilled on the next day and the anaesthesia he used was so strong, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack (I have had anaethesia before and it was never like this).  He proceeds to drill on my teeth and that was the beginning of my dental  problems.  For about a month and a half I suffered discomfort chewing and temperature sensitivity.  I finally call the office and complained and they tell me to come in for an 'adjustment'.  He does some more drilling and it seems a bit better, but still my teeth still don't feel the same.  A few weeks later, I notice a black dot on one of the teeth he has massacred.  I brush it and it appears to go away, however, I notice a very small cavity on that tooth that is going through the filling.  WTF?!?  I immediately make an appointment to see my old dentist (who's office is far from where I live, but has been my dentist for the last 11 years).

I tell my dentist what this guy told me and did to me and I come to find out the 'microfillings' were COMPLETELY UNECESSARY!!!  My dentist just shook his head and said 'that's too bad'.  Everyone has small fissures in their teeth.  They are a cause for concern if you are a teenager, but for mature adults who maintain good dental hygiene, they are basically dormant and as long as you continue with good brushing habits, they will remain dormant.  

My old dentist proceeds to tell me that the dot I am seeing on my tooth is the result of an air bubble in the filling material that popped and exposed my drilled-on tooth to decay.  Now, after this M-F'er jacked my teeth up, I have a real cavity that is showing up on xrays.  My dentist told me I could go back to Douglas and have him fix the filling for free, I said ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IN HELL AM I LETTING THIS A-HOLE within a mile of my teeth.  I would rather pay my old dentist to fix this botch job.  Keep in mind that the reason I had this work done was because of the scare tactics he used.  Well it's been over 8 months and the 6 'microcavities' that I did not end up filling (because of my nightmare experience with the first 4) are NOT full blown cavities like I was scared into believing would happen.  In fact, the teeth on the side of my mouth that this guy did not touch are perfect.  So, now I have a real cavity in the tooth he jacked up and I have to suffer the rest of my life by being on the never ending hamster wheel of maintaining these unecessary fillings every 5 years.

So, the moral of the story is: Don't get seduced by all his high tech equipment.  Those kind of offices are all about the flash and sizzle and somebody has to pay for all that overhead and expensive equipment.  Guess what?  That somebody is YOU!  He will come up with any excuse to work on your teeth to generate revenue even if the work is COMPLETELY UNECESSARY like mine was.  If he mentions the word 'micro-filling' or 'micro-cavity' get out of your chair and RUN out of his office unless you want your mouth utterly destroyed.The guy who helped me was really rude and barely said a word to us. Didn't even give us the different price options and it ended up costing a lot more than we expected. Unfriendly and made us, the customers, feel like a nuisance.My recommendation, do not go!  Tonight's dinner could possibly be the worst experience at any restaurant ever.  Our server was short with us and seemed to have no time and it wasn't even busy.   The food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce. La Torretta was over priced and the atmosphere was plain and seemed quite dated.  

I don't know who might have posted the other positive reviews but I can only guess it's family.I had a lower blepharoplasty (eye lift) by Dr. Nachbar in September 2003. This procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. My eyes will always have Dr. Nachbar's mark on them. Some of the damage is not fixable.

The results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed  low and not in a natural laugh line. To make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3/4 of an inch and ended with a divit. This divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. The incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. The left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. A  piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. Both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. My eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure.

I communicated my concerns to a Sharon Brown on staff by e-mail and phone. She was completely unhelpful. I requested my money back and never received it.

I am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. If I could give zero stars I would. I truly regret every day that I chose Dr. Nachbar as my surgeon. I hope this review helps you in your choice.Continue to be horrible. Now I ordered carpet, they input the wrong one, when I communicate this they tell me the carpet I ordered 12/24 is no longer carried! This store is a train wreck.One word.  Yuck!By far the WORST wash I have ever received anywhere, and this was a $70.00 service.  I still have stains on my passenger side carpet (which was the reason for getting the shampooing in the first place).  I don't think that they even washed it as they were supposed to.  I had to tell them for 20 minutes major areas that they had missed.   I need to clean all of  the windows myself since they are dirty still and have water spots and fingerprints on them.  The guy I arranged everything with was nice and assured me everything would be perfect.  I told him if I was going to pay so much I was going to be very picky.  He understood and guaranteed it would be perfect.  However, he was not the one doing the work.   I would be upset if I had only paid $12.00, because there are plenty of places that do a much more thorough cleaning for that.  But having paid far more, I feel the need to alert my fellow yelpers to this scam of a car wash.  My car reeks of mildew and the wet seat with whatever they used to clean stained my shorts a yellowy brown color.  Thank God I didn't have somewhere to be after the car wash.  This place is a nightmare!Never been here. Just tried to get a menu to place an order for an office.  I was told there is no menu on the web.  And that they can't fax me one.  So.... they don't want take out business??  He said I should come in. Then what - call back to the office for the orders of everyone.Needed a simple screw tightened on an implant. Standard screwdriver does it. They quoted me a dentist and 2 specialists and $750.  I have done it myself before but thought I would have a dentist take a look at it.

Update went to a different dentist and he tightened it for $59.If I could give no stars I would. I went in with my friend looking for a dress for her wedding. We tried to find someone to help us and when we finally did all she did was point and say " the dressing rooms are over there" that was all the help we were offered the whole time we were there. And in the dressing room there was no one to help us and an entire rack fell over and almost hit us. We will never return, I highly do NOT recommend this store.The Coffee - standard starbucks.

The People that work here?  Zombies

I've been coming here for 6 months and order the exact same 'ordinary' thing, and NOT ONCE have that remembered what I order.  It's a friggin coffee - plain - same size every friggin time.

One visiting this location should not expect any "hospitality", "emotion", "intelligence", "warmth" or any normal service that one would get at a more personal cafe.

Get your coffee and leave - and remember, the coffee isn't THAT good anyway.

This place sucks.Multiple issues from time of check in until check out. 
I called to make the reservation, I was considering a different hotel but chose the Fiesta specifically because I was told breakfast was included with the room rate. Upon check in, I was told breakfast was not included. The front desk receptionist was rude and off-putting. I asked to speak to the manager. She went behind a partition and came back out and told me that the manager said breakfast wasn't included. The manager wouldn't even come out to talk to me. I got my key and went to my room. I headed out about 5 minutes later and had the shuttle driver drop me at my destination. When my husband and I were ready to go back to the hotel, we called for the van. I got into the van, but he wanted to stay a little bit longer at the bar. So I asked the shuttle driver to drop me at the hotel, then go back to the same corner to pick up my husband. He said he would. I texted this information to my husband assuming he would be back at the hotel within about an hour. I was sitting in the lobby texting him and a large woman that I assume worked for the hotel came up to me aggressively and asked "are we expecting any problems tonight??!" I was taken aback by her aggressive tone and stance. I just said "uh... no..." and this scared me enough to head to my room and wait for my husband to get there. 
I fell asleep within about 5 minutes and woke in the morning to find that he was still not in the room. I checked my phone and had missed calls and voicemails from him, but my phone was on vibrate so I didn't hear it ring and it didn't wake me up. 
Apparently the driver never went back to get him. So, my husband ended up taking a cab to the hotel. When he got to the hotel, he asked for the room number and was told that it wouldn't be given to him. The room was in my name and I was the one who  checked in and had the room key. My husband explained the situation and was still told that he could not have the room number. I do understand the security reasons behind this and I respect that protocol. HOWEVER, why wouldn't the hotel staff simply call my room to verify that my husband was allow to have access??? Or have the security person come to my room and knock on the door to ask me? I do not understand why they wouldn't do this. Especially given that the drive KNEW I was waiting for my husband and I gave NO INDICATION to the security guard that there was a safety or security issue. 
End result is that they literally KICKED HIM out of the hotel. They would not give him my room number nor would they try to accommodate him, other than calling him a cab. The cab ride home cost us over $100. Simply infuriating. I plan to post this review on many review sites and I will make sure word of mouth gets out as well about the unprofessional and aggressive attitude of the staff. I'm outraged. We were treated like second class citizens. Something needs to change or I expect your "resort" will likely be closing soon.Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.We were going to eat at Beavers Choice but they were closed today. We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING 

I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. 

The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.
Also

The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion. 


I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!Had a bad experience with promised sale prices on a used car. Drove 30 miles went into dealer to buy the car and found they had jacked it up 1000.00 from what we discussed after they got me in the door. Dealt with Dave, Charles and Steve. Steer clear they will waste your time.I'm new to AZ, but I've always been very pleased with Big O in California.  So today, when I got a flat I decided to head to the closest Big 5 and have my two rear tires replaced.  I phoned ahead and was told that they would have my tires in around 2:30pm and would give me a call.  I got the call around 4pm and headed right over.  The wait was longer than I am accustomed to, and after a while I was called into the garage area.  I notice that the hood of my car is open.  "That's odd," I think since they are only supposed to be swapping the rear tires.  The mechanic explains to me that they can't get the hood to latch and wants to know if there is anything wrong with it.  "No, it's never given me any trouble at all in six years, and why the hell are you poking arounud under my hood when all I want done is the two rear tires replaced?"  He explains that they are doing a "courtesy check" of all my fluids and such.  Great, now please close my hood.  Over the next 20 minutes a procession of mechanics spray WD40 into the latch and slam the hood with increasing violence.  Eventually, someone gets it closed.  The manager comes over for me to pay the bill (which I do).  I tell him that I'm pretty upset that my hood was fine, didn't need to be messed with and now has to be violently slammed to close.  He gives me a line that "we open and close hoods all the time, and we couldn't possibly have screwed it up."  Ok, fine, whatever, I've already spent too much time here and need to be on my way.  I leave, angry, but done, or so I think.  About a mile from the shop, as I approach a stoplight my rear hatchback pops open.  Apparently they couldn't manage to close that properly either.  There are some good Big O's out there, this isn't one of them.  Avoid this location like the plague.Wasn't that good,, tasted a lot like Pizza Hut,, really wasn't worth the price.... You can tell they use frozen dough.... The sauce tasted like it came straight from the can.. Just wanted to try it once,, but I assure you I will never go back....  I can make a better pizza at home....Scheduled me and my two kids.  Appt at 9 am.  Didn't see the first of us until 10am.  Didn't let me escort my daughter (teen) but did let me escort my son (at about 10:30am).  They were disorganized and behind schedule.  My daughter said the doctor/dentist wasn't personable-- didn't explain things to her.  She said the hygienist was nice though.  Same dentist seemed like he wanted to get my son in for more xrays, son might be missing an adult tooth underneath baby molar.   But then the assistant took us back after he left and did full pano xray.  He was not missing that tooth.  Weird that the dentist wasn't willing to do it right then-- wanted us to make another appt.  They did fluoride treatment on my daughter without asking me, which was $17.  Which I paid, but they should have asked first, I would have said yes-- principle though.  I never got seen, they ran out of time for me, because we had to leave by noon.  Took 2.5 hours to see 2 out of 3 of us.  Weren't very friendly.  And to boot, I found out they use Dr Jeffrey Kootman for their surgeon on Thursdays-- he did extracted my wisdom teeth years ago and I would NEVER let him touch my kids or myself EVER again.  Very disappointed.  Don't get Total Dental insurance-- hard to find a good dentist and this is an example of what you get!Can I give no stars please?!?! Went in there and had My boyfriend ask for a water- bartender refused to serve us because we had been drinking already. Aren't they obligated to do that? What a joke. F the Yelp reviews. Service is what's worth talking about, and Tonys Definitely does not deliver.
BoooOooOoOoo!The food may be good, but the staff and service stink.  I have come here a couple of times since they are open 24 hours.  I went to the drive thru and sat there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgment, so I decided to go in.  I had to wait another 5 minutes to order.  The cashier then overcharged me for my food. When I complained the cashier made it be known how inconvenient it was.  As i sat to wait for my order, the staff began speaking in Spanish about my order.  (I know Spanish) While I didn't catch everything that was said,  it was enough for me to throw away my food as I walked out the door from an uneasy "they probably spit in the food" feeling.Worst place to go if you really want to eat and enjoy......bad food complimented with worst service possible in this world. Ambiance is ok ok kinds......only good thing is it is not one of those restaurants which looks like rat holes. Staff is not at all courteous.......and it looks like they don't know how to smile to your customers....looks like they are only paid to serve...not to treat their customers well.      
We orders some dishes and 4 gobi paranthas.....they came back after 10 mins informing us that they are out of flour and so can serve only 3....we said okay.......but were shocked to hear such an excuse!! Anyhow...that was not the end....when they actually brought food, they told us that they don't even have a single so they chose for us to bring plain naan (not even asking us or apologizing)!!  Wait....that was not the end too!! When they brought the check...it was having an extra beer which we never ordered...and when I pointed this out to the owner...he behaved as if I had done a crime pointing this out....he said how can you blame us like this....we put only those things that we ordered...and refused pointblank to accept the mistake.
Overall...a strict no no for this place.....Roaches on the bar? Kitchen closed at 10;15 PM? What happened to this place? YUCK!!!! Caught a roach on the bar and put it in a glass upside down. No apology, the barkeep just put it on the other side of the bar near other employees standing around talking!! The counter was dirty and there was trash on the floor and under all the counters!! Where is the health commission? I used to love this place but I can't drink and not eat. dui alley is right there and it's only 10:15!! Still very hungry sounds like bad management. Thank god off site betting keeps them alive but damn this place is filthy. They should be embarrassed but I will take my business back Mellow Mushroom where the kitchen is always open and the bar is cleanBoth my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again.So apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood Mexican place.  The last 2 times we were the food was terrible!  3 Margarita's officially broke my heart and I am unwilling to get hurt again!If I could give it zero stars I would. Service was slow and horrible. I tried the meat sampler which looked like they cut open someone's stomach who had recently eaten BBQ, boiled it up, drowned it in BBQ sauce and then served me that mess. Greasy, disgusting...I almost crapped myself on the way home. Seriously, I almost didn't make it. All I can say is that Guy Fieri is a total f$%^ing whore for recommending this dump.

If you really want to go there, make sure you wear diapers before eating.I went in to pick up a few things and headed to check out.  5 people in front of me and within 1 minute , 3 behind me; one cashier.  She waits on 2 people with multi items and as I am walking out of the store, she finally calls for back up.  This is the second time this has happened in the last 30 days in exactly the same way and with the same outcome for me.  I went back the second time because they have always been courteous and I thought it was a one time thing.  They obviously have some kind of staffing issue that isn't working very well and I won't be going back any time soon.  My money spends everywhere.I try not to have any regrets in life, but i regret not going to my normal place.
My friend and I needed pedicures and quality girl time together.  This place was between her and my house and I found a coupon, so we went.
There's nothing special about this place.  The same prices and services as every other nail salon in the grocery store plazas.
My toes look really nice, except for the chunks of skin missing around my nails.  I don't really have much cuticle down there, so that may have been the problem.  Maybe she has a routine.  
It hurts to walk.  4 of my toes have scabs surrounding my nails.  Last I checked, the cuticle only grows on the bottom.  
I guess that's what I get for trying to save $2.This place is not woman of color friendly, If you are African American you will BR ignored for fair skin ladies that the sales staff thinks will purchase more. I went in on a Thursday evening lookin to purchase a few items after the sales girls helped two people that walked in after me, when one finally acknowledged me she said she had to take a phone call and left and neve came back! No one else recieved that treatment but me, terrible service I took my money elsewhere.Gluten free people need Tamari, I understand you have soy sauce but that doesn't help me, come on Sakana, we come here so often, it's 3 dollars.Stopped for lunch.  Service and food are not  good.  I had the ham and cheese melt.  Bread wasn't toasted and soggy, fries were burnt.  Husband had the crispy chicken sandwich- not worth $10.  Bread was hard and not fresh, fries were burnt also.  We split a slice banana cream pie.  It was okay but nothing about it taste homemade.  As we left I heard they were under new management and I'm wondering if this is why it's going downhill?  Kinda sad as we like to support the locals.I can tell you this I will not be a regular here. Sorry Big Apple but me no likee. You get good size portions but quality and taste is a big part of it too. chicken strips overcooked with a hard crust. .Whatever the heck the corn mush was tasted bad.  They are testing out a dark loaf of bread was supposed to be served with meal we got that toward the end. No bueno no flavor to it. I ordered a steak it was nasty dry and small. I was like this aint no rib eye. There was no steak sauce. Oh and the smoked chicken was so overcooked it was very dry I think it was old ugh. Well at least we had a nice time with the family. Thats all that matters.The least satisfying place in Goodyear. Not only did we experience slow service(2hr wait) but the owner (and manager) clearly expressed  no concern that four people in our party specifically ordered gluten free pasta and meals received regular pasta and breaded meats. When we pointed out the time delay and food allergies they replied " so what is the problem?"

A lack of concern for their service is obvious.Rude employees.  Don't expect much help. Slowest check-outs EVER.I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the "Paul Revere of Yelp" and warn all of you good people.

They are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked "with guacamole and sour cream"? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, "that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it," but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.

Look, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money. 

The decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said "He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen." Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self.The facility is big enough but that is kind of the only positive thing I can say.  The ice is bad, the price outrageous. My main problem however is how bad it is for families.  I've been to other facilities where we could bring an umbrella stroller (for a 1-year-old) but here-no dice.  Which is made more unfortunate because it's not posted anywhere.  We had to show up to find out.  They also don't have any walkers for inexperienced skaters-so two of my kids who were looking forward to it couldn't do much.  At least my 7 year old had fun.   I really did try to be nice to the employees when I suggested they put more on their website but they were apathetic teenagers who were less than helpfulWorst Dennys ive ever been to. Waited 30 minutes for a half plate of food. Waitress was unattentive. Meanwhile our buddies in the table next to us ate, payed the bill, and were completely done before WE EVEN GOT OUR FOOD. The manager offered no discount or comp or anything for our troubles. Thats pretty bad service. Id give it half a star if i could..Not impressed and won't be back.  Service was great. We came with our restaurants.com coupon and they did not charge us the 18% tip the rule said was required which was nice but we still tipped them well. 

Place is clean and roomy. Has a TV but was hard to hear over the noise and it wasn't very crowded.

We ordered the 20" pizza and mild wings.  Was happy about the large sizes. We had pepperonie and garlic topping with their regular thin crust.  Wing had good flavor and was not overly drenched in sauce. They were meaty and plump.
Pizza was very sad. Crust was flavorless cardboard looked and tasted like a premade frozen type.  Sauce tasted ordinary and blah out of a can.  Not enough toppings and the garlic I think was from a jar not fresh.

Won't be back.How can someone call this a pizza?  Saw the deals and reviews of how wonderful this place was so I had to try it.  When I got my pizza I was not sure of what I was looking at.  The crust was soggy, cheese not fully melted, and sauce was memorable in a bad way.  I guess I got what I paid for.It saddens me terribly right now to give such a low rating to this hotel, when the hotel was actually awesome. The rating is so low due to the customer service my friends and I received from the pit boss during Sunday morning (6/2/13) blackjack session. My softball team and I all stayed at Sunset Station for a softball tourney that we had about 10 miles away. The price was right and we had a teammate who was a high roller at this casino. The food and service the restaurant was great, and the customer service in the gift shop was excellent as well. The problem arrived when 3 friends and I sat down early Sunday morning, money and drink in our hands to play $5 blackjack. The dealers Nana and Leissle were happy to have a change of pace and to play with 4 girls excited and eager not only to tip but to celebrate our winnings together. The cocktail waitresses also enjoyed our company. We sat at this table
For at least 3 hours while the pit boss Ralph continued to tell us we were too loud?!?!!?! As the 4th hour approached us, my friend and I hit a 3rd blackjack in a row betting a $25 hand and we all screamed in excitement. The PitBoss Ralph- then decided to kick myself and my friend out for being too loud! When I asked for a manager, they brought over a large security guard named Mark to escort us out. As we tried to reason with them, I kindly and cooperatively asked to speak with a manager. They denied me the rights to speak with a manager then Mark put his hands on me and told me he would call the cops. I then asked to speak to his manager. After two more security guards came over and our friends were in tears and we had all been denied the right to speak to a manager they denied us yet again and asked us  to fill out a comment card! Even one of the cocktail waitresses walked over to explain to the security guard that we were doing nothing wrong. The security guards then warned us they had called the police and they were on their way. We exited the casino immediately after that. I will never stay here again, nor will my team or anyone I know. I will be calling to speak with a manager and because I left my name and number I am expecting ad waiting for someone to call me!!! Worst customer service and Las Vegas and overall casino experience I have ever had. Be aware and do not stay there. The rooms are cheap, but at what cost!!! You have no rights, and no respect!!!!!Had an appointment today for my son, I have been a patient for years. Our original appointment was for 2:30 we were called earlier in the day and asked if we could come earlier ,I changed the appointment to 1:00. After waiting till 2:15 and still not being seen I told the girl at the front desk that we would be leaving. She didnt seem to care at all. I have always found the doc and PA here to be great however their staff has always sucked. Based on this I will Not be returning. I will find a new doctor for me and my son. Doctors should never forget that the patients time is important also.i would never have gone here since i hate italian chain places but we were given a gift certificate. So here is the breakdown
Calamari- I could have fit the whole order in my hand. I was overdone and the worst i ever had.
-Eggplant Parm- Me wife had this and took three bites. She said it was under cooked and very bland. I tried a forkfull of the pasta that came with it. No taste at all
-Lasagna Bolognese. So - so. It was not that bad for a chain place but i would not go back for it
-Tapas meatballs. They were drowned in sauce and carmalized onion..apparently for a reason. to cover up their horrid taste.
 
The only chain place i would order pastas are Cheesecake Factory, they are all good there!!This place was horrible!  The pizza was so bad I had to spit it out... I also ordered the chopped salad, not only was the salad chopped to nothing, the balsamic dressing was not good.As a Las Vegas resident I have visited numerous Chipotles across town. This one is by far the worst. They give you as little as possible. The workers are stingy with the food like it is coming out of their paycheck. If you ask for extra anything they will ignore you. If I am paying $10 for a bowl I expect a decent size serving. The line is always out the door because they are very slow and out of product all the time. Drive the extra mileage to go to a better Chipotle across town because you will get better service and food.So let me just say I never ever write reviews but I'm so upset at the customer service I received at this location it's ridiculous! Went
To service desk to Register for my baby (first child) and woman asks me what I'm wanting to register for, I told her everything and proceeded to tell me that they didn't really have a big selection and maybe I would be better off going across the street to babies r us...Wow ok so if her goal was to send me away and deter me she did a great job and then she mentioned that she didn't have any free bie packages for new mothers to give me, omg! I wasn't looking for anything free all I wanted was to be registered at Toys r us for my friends and family to help celebrate our joy of our first child. I will not be Registering there at all! Ever!So I ordered a large 16 inch Pizza Napolitana for delivery with 3 items, and asked for mushrooms, tomatoes and anchovies(only on half the pizza) the guy charged me $5 for delivery because I lived like 5 miles away instead of the 3 miles radius that they charge 2$ for which I didnt mind paying although it didnt seem fair and when I got my pizza i wish I had returned it. My total was $24 something and for a 16inch 3 topping pizza it was a total rip off. 
The anchovies I asked for only on half the pizza ended up being 3 tiny pieces on 4 big slices of pizza, thats not even one anchovie for a slice!!! 
Also, mushrooms and tomatoes are not the most expensive veggies in the world and it looked as if they sliced just one mushroom and one tomatoe for a large pizza that clearly looked that these guys were trying to make money and not a quality pizza. It might be a different story if you are in the restaurant for a sit down where they cant do it to your face but for delivery they totally try to get away with being as cheap as possible and $24 dollars for a pizza shouldnt be a cheap pizza with barely anything on it, bottom line, i paid $24 dollars for a cheese pizza.Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning.I liked this place and gave it good review last year.  Their  featured Thanksgiving menu looked interesting but it was terrible.  The food was cold and had to be sent back twice for reheating.  The desert was yucky and ugly.  The waiter didn't seem surprised that the dishes were barely touched.  What makes it all the more galling is that the meal was $35 per person and we left hungry.  Horrible.  We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager and he said nothing.  Happy Thanksgiving---Not.I'd give a 0 if I could. The staff is very friendly, but the food is HORRIBLE! My husband and I got food poisoning from some lengua tacos and Carne asada fries. I guess I should've seen it coming when the cashier/cook said he was having trouble finding the lengua. (cow tongue. Hey, don't knock it till you try it... Somewhere else, of course.)This is by far the worst Roberto's in the area.

Its the nearest one to where I currently live so we would go out of convenience. Being that it's a Roberto's the food is basically the same as anywhere else but for some reason getting what you actually ordered is a challenge. 

They charge a $1.10 to add guacamole to an item and on 3 separate occasions I got home and they had neglected to add it even though I had paid for it. I initially shrugged it off and didn't want to get all bent about the situation but it definitely got on my nerves.

The next time I went in I made sure to tell them about the guac situation and this time they included it but still charged me despite their 3 past screw ups. I thought, alright fine it's just a dollar.

A few days later we returned for breakfast burritos. Took the order home and they had put the wrong meat inside of one of them. I don't know how Carne Asada gets confused with Shredded Beef - and in a breakfast burrito nonetheless. Gross combination. 

At that point it was clear that they are simply too incompetent to get a to-go order done correctly. A mistake or two is understandable but this is just ridiculous. It happened time after time, consecutively. I shouldn't have to babysit them while they make the damn food to make sure they are doing their jobs correctly. 

I have never had this issue at the other location I used to frequent and though it is a longer drive I will be going back to the old location. 

Don't waste your time and money on this Roberto's. They are sloppy and careless. They don't pay attention to what they are doing, especially at 1am when the place is dead and they aren't even busy (which is usually when we would go). No thanks.LOVE YOUR PET? THEN GO ELSE WHERE!
If your going here for their low rates then I suggest only getting vaccines (dirt cheap) on weekends, how ever if in any case you need someone to care for your animal, then you got the wrong place. my poor dog was sick with diarrhea, I took him in for his shots and explained that he was sick, they said that ad long as he is eating and drinking he'll be fine, well guess what he wasn't. I had to bring him in again for blood work I was never explained what was wrong with him instead they said Dr. Stefano says "bring him back in for more blood work" (I guess one test isn't enough or they needed to charge me again,  AWESOME). I declined, and sought a second opinion I went to Pebble and Maryland animal hospital, and when I requested the records to be faxed over they gave me attitude (how audacious), they faxed over only shot records and when I called them again they said  "we will no longer fax anything" and hung up on me! WOW,  how Unprofessional this is how they treat patrons, just imagine your animal in their care? You're better off leaving them with dr. Kavorkhian at least he would sympathize.  Take my word, experience and frustration and heed my warning.Me and the wife decided to give this place a try. We came in on a Thursday and the World Cup was going on,it was a bit loud but to be expected. I ordered the dozen oysters, seafood bowl, and chicken fajitas. We washed that down with hands down one of the best red beers I have ever had. 
Now onto the food. The waitress brought us out two waters which we didn't ask for and charged 1.50 a piece for them. The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it. The chicken fajitas were cooked well there was plenty of chicken fajita and also came with a side of rice and beans however the tortilla wraps or disgusting and fell apart in your mouth while you're eating. 
The prices are absolutely ridiculous the chicken fajitas were $16 my seafood bowl was 17 ,two beers were seven dollars apiece you could just go and get the same quality food for probably a third or a half of the cost.
The only redeeming factor of this place is the furniture inside does have a Mexican island feel and the Mariachi band was pretty cool but the food is utter trash and the level of attention that the workers placed on the customers was also poor.
I understand the World Cup was going on however these employees are being paid to serve customers but without the customers they would be out on the ass.Slooooowest Trop Smoothie everr!!!
I frequent this location since I work in the shopping center n it's always a drag even when they r slow :/I don't get this place. Servers and management don't speak English so if they make a mistake or screw up your food they still let you pay for it. Very average sushi with lots of creams to cover the flavor.Get out of the business Lowes!  Home Depot knows what they are doing so get out of their way.
Sound harsh?  read on then judge for your'e self.
I manage 3 4 plex apartments here in las vegas, and needed 2 sets of counter tops for 2 units that I was quoted 1/2 of what Home Depot wanted.  Time was critical these units are being rented by two families that live in their cars currently because they are down on their luck.  (my employer is very generous and rehabs units for low income housing giving people a second chance)
I went to Lowes on w. charleston and the price was more than 2x what i was quoted on the phone.  I was in a hurry so I ordered them and was assured they would be there on 6-13.  I called 6-13 told they were not in and called 6-14, & 6-15 again told they were not in.  Turns out they were in the whole time but the employees were too lazy too look on the back of the counters to see who they belonged to.
When Lowes finally found the counters they had made a mistake and ordered the wrong size they were both too short.
6-26 Lowes has the counters in and they are too short a second time.  Store manager  Ben is supremely disinterested and I am pushed off to the counter top guy again.  I explain I need the counter top 8' not 7' he seems to understand this time.  
6-27 Lowes calls to take measurements themselves because they still haven't ordered the right size yet!  I met counter top guy on site show him I need 8', he leaves assures me he will order as soon as he gets back to store.
6-28 4:30 pm (today) I get call from Lowes they screwed up the credit card charge and haven't ordered the tops yet!
Meanwhile I have 2 families living in their cars waiting on counter tops so the county will let them move in and Lowes can't seem to get it together!
As if this wasn't enough, I was assured that the area manager Lary Ednes from Lowes would call to help me out with this problem.  Well Larry, its been 3 days and counting; each day I'm assured by your office i will receive a call that day and nothing.
Helloooo?  Lowes,? is anybody home?

Lowes your slogan is "Lowes never stop improving".  Well when are you going to start?Horrible...My friend and I decided to get a pedi after work today... That was a huge mistake..They cut a chunk out of my foot and didn't even apologize.. They talked to each  other in their language and didn't even say hi to me.. the worst part is that we were in our uniforms so they know we were locals... I will NEVER return and neither will my friend.. Oh and I posted a pic on here of my foot too... I forgot to mention that another tech did surgery on her foot with a needle and put the needle in a sanitary bucket right in front of us.. thank goodness I have been vaccinated for hepatitis.. :(  .. and I'd love to give this palce a negative 5 stars.. And I forgot to mention that the nail tech next to us pulled out a needle and did surgery on her foot right in front of us and put the needle in the "clean" box.. WTF...This place is a HUGE ripoff. I have a 2009 Camry that needed an oil change; tell me why they're trying to charge me $300 for all kinds of other services such as brake check, tire check, filter check (mind you other places do that as part of the service already!). It doesn't end there. So apparently, $30 to change/add oil, that's it, other fluids won't be topped off, that's extra! That's like the barber shop wanting extra to clean off the hair they cut off from your neck! I'm surprised they didn't try to charge me to talk to their front desk. Needless to say, I took my car back and refuse to give them even one penny. This place is so unethical, but I guess it's my fault for not wanting to take my car to the place I normally take it to who charges $70 and get everything these thieves were trying to get away with.ok, so what they forget to tell you when you book a room at this property is you don't actually get what you pay for.  Ok so the room is a bit less than other places, but when you get here they hit your credit card for something they call a "daily resort amenity fee" which is equal to or even more than the room actually costs you in the first place !!  If I would have been aware of this I NEVER would have stayed here !!  I would have stayed at one of the more appropriate hotels.  The staff seems as if they are completely understaffed and overworked and they have been rude as hell the entire time we have been here.  We spent 1 hour just checking in to this place as the line was out the door and they only had 2 people working.  It was completely annoying.  NONE of the rooms have coffee makers as the hotel has determined that they are a "fire hazard" ?!  Really?? The halls outside the rooms are filthy with trash and things that people have put outside their rooms and that have not been picked up by the staff.  The Buffet that I can remember being great in the past was completely sub-par and most items had absolutely no flavor what so ever.  I can say over all I am a bit disgusted with The Palace Station and will not stay here again !Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business.Hi.  I grew up in Las Vegas and have eaten breakfast at the Omelet House many times.  My experiences have always been decent which is why I am completely disheartened by my family's last experience with the Omelet House.  Yesterday, my husband and our two children, ages 8 and 4, were running errands and decided to have breakfast there.  My husband had been fasting for blood work.  The facility was across the street and as anyone who has ever had to maneuver around Charleston and Rancho knows, it is quite difficult to get around due the no u-turn lanes and multiple lanes of traffic.  My family parked at the Omelet House and walked across the street at 9:50am.  He signed in at the blood place at 9:57am.  He returned at almost 10:25am ready to eat food and noticed that his car was missing.  The Omelet House had him towed.  Now I understand the need for ample customer parking on busy days, like weekend brunch, but it was Monday and there were many open parking spaces.  The gentleman and I use that term loosely, claimed that he waited 30 minutes to call the tow truck, but tow records show that they called at 9:52.  As my now stranded husband was trying to figure out what to do, The Omelet House staff read to him from a piece of paper something that ended in him needed to leave the premises with threat of arrest.  Did I mention he had two small children with him?  When did we stop treating people like people?  How would parking in the lot been any benefit to my family unless they were planning to eat at the Omelet House?  Well, if the purpose of the parking policy is to keep people from parking there, it worked.  I know of at least 4 people that will never park in the parking lot again.  Good job Omelet House!I paid for an estimate ($99) from this company and was told that it would be $774 for the repairs to my LG front load washer. Plus they wanted me to pay them in cash after taking a check for the estimate. I chose not to work with them on this repair because I felt that they may not be around to warranty their repairs. I then had someone from LG come out and the same repairs were $324 instead of $774. Buyer beware...This is located attaching to PT's Pub. As many have voiced it is better drunk. Most of the time the beans are way too runny the meat is flavorless and its just bad mexican food. Ive had it at fairs and at several locations it is just bad jujuThis place should definitely stay hidden! Spend the money elsewhere for a GOOD haircut! The hairstyles are as outdated, & old school as the ladies that work there. The receptionist reffered my sister & I to a lady that was supposed to be good with cuts "Madge", but this Jamaican lady that cut my hair was horrible! She obviously never had that many white clients because she was  rude, & very rough w/my sister & I & didn't know what she was doing. She would grab a bunch of hair, pull it, & start chopping! I was supposed to have a layered look. But I would have gotten better results if I gave a blind person shears & a bowl. When she was finished she had me look in the mirror & I noticed one side of my hair was way shorter than the other, after she had been chopping for a good 20 min! She told me my hair must've already been that way.... Never again!DON'T EVER GO TO CAFE VERDI!!!! (3111 S. Valley View, LV). I ordered a Chicken Parmesan breast and side Caesar salad. It took an hour to deliver and I got chicken fingers and fries. When I called to let them know my order was wrong, I was on hold for over 10 minutes waiting for the manager. When he got on the phone and I told him what happened, he says "I can bring your order in an hour and a half. We are really busy cause it's lunchtime." I said, "You do this for a living. Don't you plan for that? I waited an hour for my food, and it's wrong, and you want me to wait another hour and a 1/2 so you can get it right?" I told him I would post a poor notice on Yelp! He laughed and said (and I quote), "WE'VE BEEN HERE 25 YEARS, WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!". THEN he hung up on me. Really? Not if I can help it. Do me a favor, don't give them your business, and make sure no one else does either. They don't appreciate it and they don't deserve it.  (And I only gave them a 1 star because 0 was not an option)Honestly first time I came here it was good second time the air was off in the room when I got there n Vegas is 100degrees they wouldn't give me the banner advertised rate as promised before n the air turned out broken the toliet didn't wrk
And I had to switch rooms then the second room air took forever to feel a tiny bit decent n still pouring sweat n found a huge dead cockaroach in my room like Wtf never again I'll pay extra 20$nxt time n stay somewhere else thnx ps no wifi in the rooms it all sux n I'm not usually that picky bout hotels just need a cool air condition place to
Sleep thnx!This place sucks! I give it 0 stars. It's cheap, but you pay for what it's worth. I went with my family & the food was cold & nasty . In top of that "supposedly" it's unlimited champaign but after the 5th cup they cut us off! What the fuck! We weren't even drunk or anything . The waitress was rude &I would not even come check on us . I will never go here again. I rather go to the Mandalay bay buffet. It's a little more pricer but it's worth it! Never again.I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.Bedbugs. Seriously. Bedbugs. Would have rather had a DUI (which I avoided by staying here instead of driving a few shitty miles to my apartment). Now instead i'm covered in bites and praying I didn't bring any of those f*ckers home with me. 

The kicker? We chose that dump because we didn't want to pay $200 a night like the places around Punk Rock Bowling that weren't sold out. Joke was on us, we paid $170. $170 a night for bedbugs. 

I don't know if anyone reading this had experienced the joy of multiple bites all over your body from little flea like bastards so I recommend googling it. And imagine them feasting on your body while you slept. Reading other reviews they also have cockroaches. $170 FOR COCKROACHES AND BEDBUGS. 

I'm just sleeping in my car next time.I Love classic coke, but was sadly disappointed when I had a coke from the McDonald's at 1343 Silverado Ranch blvd in Las Vegas. This is the third time I've tasted poorly mixed Co2 and syrup at this location. Are they trying to cut cost by dispensing more Co2 then syrup? I would have returned to the store to complain, but I had driven off by the time I took my first taste. Someone or the Coca Cola Rep please change the bag in the box or balance the mix so I can taste a true coke, I would hate to cross over to another brand over this continued issue at this McDonald location. I expect my coca cola experience to be excellent with each drink I consume.so so so so many issues from bad customer service, super expensive, and then surprise charges on your bill

FILE A COMPLAINT AT THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU !!!Irma, the surgery scheduler failed to call us to inform us my husband's procedure had been cancelled. We took time off work and he started eye drops seven days prior as prescribed. Irma was rude to us from the start. This was a frustrating experience. We are going with another eye group.I love Italian food. Never visited an Olive garden before. My wife had a $25 dollar gift card, so I took my wife here to use the gift card and try out the olive garden. 
  My first impression upon walking in was not good due to the bad smell. Smelled like stale Parmesan cheese mixed with the body odor of several people that havent taken a bath in a month.  I sat down and was given menus. The menus had dried food smeared all over them from previous customers. 
  The waiter had cookie crumbs on his shirt, and what appeared to be salad dressing stains on front of shirt. 
  I was tempted to walk out, but decided what the hell, lets use this gift card up. 
 Ordered the special   unlimited bread sticks, soup, or salad, and pasta with sauce for me and wife. (9.99 each)
 Waiter brought a basket with a whopping 3 bread sticks. I got the salad, wife got soup. The salad tasted pretty good, but mostly had just 3 green salad leafs. The rest was mostly salad stems, onions, croutons and other junk. They give you a big bowl of salad and it is mostly stems. I could have asked for more salad, but I might have to argue about not finishing what was brought to me. 
   The pasta seemed to have been sitting around for a while before I arrived. It was dehydrated and not fresh. had to use knife and fork to cut it up. The marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it. I could only manage to force myself to take a few bites. What crap!!!! The back ground smell, and the pasta smell and taste almost had my stomach churning. 
    the fun part was when the waiter brought the check. The total was 28.39, I gave him the 25 dollar gift certificate, and 3.40 in cash. had to wait for 15 minutes for my change., and waiter tried offering us dessert, which was included. I declined desert, as the deserts were probably crap too. I took my penny of change and departed with out leaving a tip. Needless to say I wont be coming back there. The prices are a bit high, and the quality of the food is terrible. The staff seems friendly and attentive, but jeezz the smell in there just makes you look at at the dirtiness around you more, and makes you wonder how clean is the kitchen.Hunnie Bunnie's pre-school is in the same lot as this spot. I decided to pick up some grub to take back to the Ranch and then catch up on The Walking Dead. 
I've never been in here before or seen a menu so I ordered a few items. The lady took my order and then I sat down with a to-go menu to wait. As soon as I opened it I saw the FAMILY DINNER menu - for $24.99 you can order two entrees on the list and it comes with two fried shrimp, two fried spring rolls, soup and either white rice or bbq pork fried rice. I called back to the kitchen and asked the lady if I could change my order to the family dinner menu?? She said it was coo. So I ordered the BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein and Egg Drop Soup. 
The food came out quickly and I was on my way. I picked up Hunnie Bunnie and she got in the car and asked: What smells so good in here girl?! 
We were so damn hungry we ate the Spring Rolls and Fried Shrimp in the car! There was a lot of black pepper in the Spring Rolls and HB said they were salty. 
The Fried Shrimp were like a shrimp roll, and lots of breading - pretty bland tasting. There was that reddish sweet dipping sauce served with these, but eating in the car I didnt have time for that nonsense! 
Anyway, got to the Ranch and opened up the rest of the food. 
Everything was pretty BLAND. Really not much flavor AT ALL. I KNOW it's Chinese fast food but COME ON! Panda Express tastes WAY better!! I most definitely wouldn't EVER waste my money on this bland ass Chinese food again!Stale chips, food under seasoned and their bathrooms smell horrible no thanks Super Mex.................................The worst place ever!!! I will never go there again and I will tell everyone I know how bad this place is.  They charged our credit card twice when we ordered shirts.  When we found out later that day we called and they said "no problem we will take care of it when you pick up the shirts." We go today and the owner says "my paper work doesn't show we got paid!" Even when we showed him a copy of our bank statement.  He was rude and had no customer serves.  We ended up paying twice for the shirts (because we needed them) and "THE OWNER" will now have to deal with our bank's fraud division!!!!  Everyone makes mistakes and that is ok but when you are rude and disrespectful to your customers, you might want to remember you are NOT the only company in town!!!!! and in these hard times you would think you would want to keep every customer you can get.Downgrading from three stars to one, due to a disastrous experience on Easter. We called a WEEK in advance to ask about vegetarian options, and were told that they could accommodate with no problem, even though it was a set menu. Turns out the "accommadation" was nothing but an appetizer from the non vegetarian version of the menu with the meat taken out. Still charged the same price though!

When we emailed to complain, they sent us back a truly patronizing email.  "We had several vegetarians that dined with us on Easter and were very pleased with the options." So you know, clearly its MY fault that I didn't enjoy whatever half assed entree they chose to throw down in front of me.  If it was my kitchen, I would have been ashamed to send that dish out to a paying customer.

Every restaurant has an off day... to me its how they deal with it that decides if they are a place worth returning to. For example, we visited Nittaya's Secret Kitchen last night and had some.. problems with the service. There was a mixup in the kitchen that resulted in our entrees being served roughly ten minutes apart. Not a great impression. What was great was that they apologized, took full responsibility, and asked what they could do to make it better. They did not say to us "Well the other customers got their entrees ten minutes apart and they were fine with it." We have every intention of going back to Nittaya's. Marche Bacchus? Well lets just say I wish this had happened last year so I could have had my rehearsal dinner elsewhere.This restaurant has gone from a 4 star to a one star in a year.  Our waitress deserves the star but the food was horrible.  Lobster salad should be taken off the menu.  It had no flavor at all.  So disappointing! Will not go back again.  What a shame...beautiful location!  Understanding it's under a new management.  Get a new chef.  Change your menu also.If you specifically request guacamole and they charge you the extra "fee" for it, then they should put it on your damn burrito...  They even forgot the mild salsa.    First and last time eating at Baja Fresh.  Should have made the drive to Chipotle.I will never take my kitties back here, EVER! This is pretty lengthy but if you read it, you will understand why:
On Monday 4/21/14 I came in for a simple ultrasound on one of my cat's abdomens- she had been vomiting for going on 5 weeks now- I had already gotten blood work and x-rays done with a previous vet which showed nothing- next step was ultrasound and then, possibly, surgery. Most vets don't have their own ultrasound equipment and time was of the essence at this point and since Craig Rd does, I simply just wanted the ultrasound so we had some kind of jumping off point of, if they had to do surgery, which organ(s) are affected
 I  brought my cat in at 640pm (after work and getting copies of her records), we waited for a room for approx 30 mins, no problem. When we got into a room, I was told it'd be another 45 mins before I could see someone. I was fine with this as I just needed some kind of answer for her. After 30 mins, a tech came in, asked me a bunch of questions and left. 20 mins later Dr. Calloway came in and asked me the same questions and stated in the least compassionate way that "we will just have to open her up and do exploratory surgery". Now, I was not opposed to doing the exploratory surgery but I wanted the ultrasound in addition to this to see upfront which area they need to explore. I was trying not to put my cat through any more than she needed. Dr. Calloway went on that they needed to do x-rays and blood work again- what for? I just had these tests done not even a month ago when she first started getting sick. She said exploratory surgery is the only way to be sure since I have done everything else. If this is the case, why did she feel it necessary to rerun tests we already did if they just wanted to slice and dice her? Now it was nearly 8pm and she informs me that the vet who can do ultrasound is going home when I was told by the front desk staff that any vet could do this. So, I asked what the cost for this procedure would be (just curious) and she said "I'll be right back". Another 20 minutes went by and another tech came in with a printout of everything they wanted to do to her- x-rays, blood work, ultrasound (even though she said it wasn't needed) and on and on to the tune of $2700 and change. Really? And he says "Ok- so you're gonna leave her here with us tonight to do this surgery tomorrow." Umm, no! I already told the vet this- didn't she hear anything I said?
In the entire 2+ hours that we were there, not once did anyone even look at my cat! They don't even know what she looks like! All they did was talk to ME and not check on the patient. I would've got the same result had I shown up there myself without her. Why did I have to stress her out and have her in a kennel for over 2 hours, not even including the car ride there and back if they weren't even going to look at her, much less do the procedure I was specifically there for?? So, I left in disgust. 
I wound up taking my baby, Panda, to Advanced Animal Care in Boca Park for the ultrasound that Thursday (1st available appt) and they found a blockage in her small intestine. Surgery was necessary so we scheduled that for Friday morning and they removed part of her intestine which was necrotic (dead), the blockage had blocked the blood supply and killed off that part of her. My point is, the ultrasound showed where they needed to "explore", and that is what I needed to know. Panda is home now and doing great! I would like to add that Advanced Animal Care, Dr. Pederson, saw nothing wrong with her blood work and x-rays and did not find it necessary to redo these same tests. She also understood the urgency of our situation. AND, since Panda had to stay overnight 3 nights, she actually stayed with her! Who does this? Vets don't typically stay with their patients. And the cost? $920- including pathology of the dead tissue, just to be sure. That is a far cry from $2700! 
So, all I can say is, I will never go back to Craig Rd and Dr. Pederson at Advanced Animal Care will be my vet from this point forward because of the superior care she gave my baby. Please do your research and ask questions! Your pet is depending on you for it's life! 
It is my belief that Dr. Calloway at Craig Rd. was trying to play on my emotions and get more money. My gut feeling about her is that she really didn't care about Panda at all and was all about the money. It's $185 for ultrasound with them- I paid $400 with Advanced Animal Care and you know why? It was worth the price to get it done right and in the long run, it cost me less and Panda got superior care. 
I'm sorry this is so long but I wanted to be very clear about why I  will never step foot in there again. I just felt like they turned their back on me and her when we needed them and felt I was being taken advantage of with the situation.So I've lived in Vegas for over a year now and I've passed by this place more than a few times and wondered how good the food/service was.  Tonight we found out...not worth your time! 

After being seated we had a very prompt waitress TO START.  She took our drink, appetizer and dinner order, then handed us off to another waitress because her shift was ending.  No problem at first, but then we didn't see our new waitress for about 15 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us, and asked if we were ready to order...already done that, and then she went and checked on our appetizer.  25 minutes later, it finally came out...2 crab cakes shouldn't take that long, but ok.  On top of all that, her attentiveness lacked when it came to drink refills, to the point that my fiance' had to get up and ask for more water...

Finally, about an hour after we were seated, our salads, which were limp and tasteless bagged salads.  Then dinner, we both ordered the fillet with grilled shrimp...what came out was NOT a fillet, looked more like thick NY strips, and 3 small shrimp...$34/plate.  Per the menu:    

"Your Steak is cut from the finest beef available in the United States."   
Please tell us how you would like it prepared.

The food was prepared ok, but by this point we were not pleased with the the quality or the service.  It was about this point that I believe the waitress caught on, because she checked on us 3-4 times in a 10 minute period.  I went to speak to the manager, who was seated at the bar, a few drinks in.

I introduced myself, then began to talk to him about what was going on...explaining about the waitress hand-off, the lack of attention and then the over-attention, and then the food.  His response to me was, "Well let me get you a gift certificate to make this better the next time you come in."  I told him straight up that I'd never come back here, and that for what they served us, $34/plate was a bit extreme.  His response: "Well, you're not going to get the kind of quality for that price anywhere else in Vegas, believe me.  That's really all I can do for you."  Ok...I guess my last year in Vegas was all a dream, because there are plenty of places that are of much better quality for the same price.  I felt very dismissed, told him thanks for his time, and then went back to my table to get my check.

The waitress asked if we wanted everything wrapped up...about half of each of our meals left, and we said "NO, just the check please."  She figured it out at this point, and we told her we had spoken with the manager about everything.  She got us the check, which was now 1/2 off, magically, and a $50 gift certificate to come back.  I paid my bill, and we beat feet out of there.  

Decor aside, or lack thereof, this place is AWFUL!  If you're in Vegas full time, spend a few extra dollars and get a steak worth your money somewhere else.  Don't waste your time going here!I've stayed here a few times just because it's literally 5 minutes down the street from family.  It's always been a problem, with people partying in the next room and some rooms stink. But my recent stay (of one night) will hopefully be my last. 
My mom drove me here around 6p.m. on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't busy at all. So I don't know why the reception clerk put me in a room on the third floor directly across from the parking garage level that takes people from their cars to the casino. I mean RIGHT ACROSS from the parking garage, like someone could be sitting in their car and I could look them in the eye from my window. Throughout the night I listened to car stereos, people laughing and yelling and a few car alarms.

After a couple of hours in the casino, I went to my room. I was tired from flying in that morning and spending the day with family, so I didn't go back down to get another room once I saw my situation. I could hear people talking in the room next to the t.v. but didn't hear anything from the room next to my bed, so I stuck my earplugs in and fell asleep thinking that room was empty. Wrong. And this is how I learned just how unbelievably thin the walls are here: at midnight I was jolted awake by a thumping sound that didn't stop. I took my earplugs out and realized it was the metal headboard in the next room being slammed against the wall (great furniture) in the room that was NOT empty. The walls were so thin that EVERYTHING was audible. I got up,moved my luggage from the other bed and right when I laid down, a car alarm went off. At 4 a.m., the guy in that room began throwing up in the bathroom, which was next to the bed I was in now. He was busy with that for half an hour, then walked into the wall, then got himself tangled in the wire hangers of the coat rack, also next to my bed. I've stayed in hotels all over the world, some not so great, but this is the only time I've been able to tell everything that was going on in another room like I was watching it. I gave up and called my mom to come get me, as I was more exhausted than when I arrive.

And here's where the Santa Fe "resort" gives you the final middle finger- when we went to the desk to check out and tell them how I had been kept awake from their thin walls and parking garage noise, they demanded an additional $15 bucks for an "amenities fee" for the 10 hours I spent in their craphole. We were told "sorry, everybody charges a resort fee" by a woman who clearly just wanted us to shut up and go away. And yea, the sheets are like laying on canvas sails.Mary Ann has moved on to the Luxe Salon near Simmons and Ann Road thank god.

Mary Ann was the only reason to be going to Spirals Salon. Mary Ann is worth the drive and again you get a professional haricut, styling, coloring, etc. at a very reasonable cost.

Call Mary Ann directly today at 650-269-1291!AVOID THIS ER - The wait is ridiculous.  I took my mother here and we waited 6 hours and she never saw a doctor.  We ended up just leaving - but they never took her insurance information (dummies), and sent her a ridiculous bill for hundreds of dollars just for the privledge of sitting around and being denied medical care.  The nursing staff who worked there were completely unsympathetic and inhospitable.  These nurses were cruel gatekeepers to the actual doctors.  Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  

The ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.

A few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first 20 minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.

They built so many houses in Summerlin and then didn't think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.  It's ridiculous and I will always make the extra drive to another hospital.I don't get how this place is ranked so high on Yelp! We chose KJ Kitchen based on Yelp ratings- GET IT TOGETHER LAS VEGAS! THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! We will not be returning to KJ Kitchen.

Usually I can overlook bad service for great food, but the meat was rubbery, slimy and flavorless on all dishes we ordered. The dishes were very unflavorful in general. 

The service was worse than the food, I had to like turn around and wave to summon our waiter whenever we needed something (and we are not at all needy) I only summoned 3 times, once to get him to come take our order after sitting there for 15 minutes, another to ask for utensils and rice after our dishes were dropped off and he took off running, and then again 15 mins after we were done and dishes cleared to ask for a check. It was awful!Apparently, the Hooters Hotel has 24-hour $3 blackjack tables. I mean, there are banners posted against the building outside, there are signs above the slot machines...The Hooters Hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $3 blackjack tables.

My friend and I walked into the Hooters Hotel.
We looked for these $3 blackjack tables.
We circled the casino three times.

THERE WERE NO $3 BLACKJACK TABLES.

One star for false promotions. 
(I was looking forward to cheap gambling too!)I have eaten here three times. Everyone always told me how amazing this place was so after trying it the first time (maybe about a year ago), and having a plain, tasteless meal, I figured maybe just a fluke or hopefully they have changed since then. I ate there about 2 months ago and again it was just blah. The third time did it for me when the food was not only gross and tasteless (AGAIN) but two people that work there that I dealt with were extremely rude! Never going back.Stopped by to pick up a new pair of walnut Blundstone boots. Was informed that they only come in black and stout(almost black). Proceeded to order said walnut boots off the Internet instead, since they do make them and saved $50. This is why local businesses are going broke, agree with the other reviewer that this shop was boring.I have never flown US Airways since they became US Airways.  I did however, fly America West and was happy with them nearly every time I flew with them.

I HAVE to write this review, as I had an awful experience with them yesterday.  I was scheduled at 7:23am out of Phoenix and arriving back here in SF at 9:30 am in enough time for work at 11am.  I arrive, and proceed to the E check-in.   The computer starts having "issues" and so I try to get the attendants attention and I failed.  Knowing I didn't have a lot of time before we depart, I decided to to to the counter check-in.   I waited 5 minutes before getting to the counter only to be told that I was no longer on this flight b/c it was less than 30 minutes before departure!  WHAT???  I have a carry on ANNNNND that computer right there (pointing at it) has something wrong with it and that is why I came through your line.  It was 25 minutes to departure and she refused to check me in!!  Again, I ONLY had a carry on.  It didn't matter to her that I had to be at work at 11am.  Arriving in SF later than 9:30 am was NOT AN OPTION for me.  She hastily said, "you can try and get through security and see if maybe they'll let you on the flight.  That is all I will do for you!"

I finally get through security and get to the gate at EXACTLY 7:22am, one minute to spare, begging the customer services reps to let me on the flight or I was going to lose my job.  

They of course told me NO.  The flight was delayed 2 hours and I was late anyway!!!  Ahhhhh...

Thankfully, the flight attendant had a lot of personality and was very accommodating to me, even if I was 1.5 hours late for work.  

I wish I had the name of that lady in the Phoenix airport downstairs at the check in desk.  I mean, when I pointed to the computer that was giving me problems, there was a tech guy working on it and she saw him.  Even seeing him, she still wouldn't accommodate me in any way and was rude about it.  Poor customer service!  I WON'T be flying this airline again, I can tell you that. 

I was not only blown away by their complete lack of care for me and the "issues" I was having with their E-check-in computer, but also the lack of  "social" skills one needs when working in customer service.  Eye contact!!Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around. I asked if I could get a half sandwich and the owner rudely asked what I expected him to do with the other half! Is he THAT stupid or just a smartass!Worst food I've ever been served. Anyone writing a good review most be a relative.
Brisket, salmon, and chick fry steak all VERY poor quality. Total waste of money. Was there 3/14/12.Austin needs to find work elsewhere. Very very rude. Mr Pettiette should be made aware how disrespectful his son is.The people are nice, but the service is just down right AWFUL.  I could go on and on but let's just put it this way, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!  3 hours for a "partial highlight" I went running out of the salon with wet hair! Worst experience in a salon ever...Went there last night since I have MLK day off.  I asked about the beer specials that they normally have on Sunday nights.  Bartender said there were not any that night.  Wow, what a slap in the face.  They took advantage of the long weekend and decided they would make more money if they did not have their usual specials.  This is bad KARMA!  I hope there are other guys out there that support Charlies all year long that are upset by this.  I would suggest not going or at least don't tip or have one less drink then you normally would.  Best bet, tell them how unfair this is either in person or via social media.Apparently I'm too nice. I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks. 

Wrong. WRONG!!!

I am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.

Upon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back. 

I miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).

No offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners. 

And that was the day that Regal lost my family's business.I was here today and found a hair in my sandwich. I was willing to overlook this, but then my sister found a hair baked into her cookie. That is more than I'm willing to overlook. maybe they should employ hair nets. They need to do something to regulate before I ever go back. I saw a dude sneeze into his hand too. Sandwiches are good, but I just don't trust the quality at this point. Sacks is goin in the litter boxComing from LA to visit Phoenix, I wanted to try the local Pho.  I have eaten at numerous Pho places in Los Angeles area and was dying to hear what all the rave was about.  I picked "DA VANG" because of the great reviews.  All i have to say was that this placed literally sucked.  The service was horrible. The waiters took our order then took almost 20 mins to get our food. I don't know if they cared that their customers came to eat and were hungry.  Second, the food that arrived was overcooked. The meat was hard, the beef tendons were obviously old and the soup was too sweet.  Overall, if you want pho, try some other place. If you're in Los angeles, I can recommend tons of great places that are fraction of the price with great service.  

Overall, Da Vang was a horrible experience, overpriced, bad food, bad experience. I will never go back to this place.This place sucks. It reflects the ghetto area surrounding it. The cashiers are loud and annoying and don't have a trace of customer service etiquette  And I'm pretty sure some of them actually bring their kids to work with them...expecting customers to babysit them. 

There is almost always some weird, drunken derelict sitting near the restrooms. And the teenagers that hang around are always talking trash about other people they know.Do not move here. I wish I would of listened to the bad reviews I saw before moving here. I would never recommend this place to anyone. It is in a bad part of Phoenix and cars were getting broken into right and left when we first moved here. There are gates but at night they are never closed or secured. You are lucky if both or even one of the pools are clean and up and running. The appliances are a joke and from the early 1900's. The management are so rude and not helpful. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.You have gotta be kidding me reviewers!  This place was neither tasty or satisfying, It wasn't cost effective, it wasn't great service. It wasn't even good food.

Let's start with the salsa. There is nothing chunky or spicy or fresh about it, It is sweet tomato sauce with a bit of onion in it. If this is salsa Ragu missed the boat by -this- much. It is most certainly not prepared there and is the absolutely worst salsa I have ever been served. I took one dip and I asked the waitress if they had any other types of salsa available. She said no. My partner said "it sort of grows on you," so I dipped a few more times and all that grew on me were questions as to how a Mexican restaurant was calling this salsa. I was considering an exit strategy, but we decided to let the food determine our visit.

Looking around the place, it was near empty, except for a large family table, a senior age couple and another couple our age who were also visiting for the first time. I know because they were asking all the questions I had about the menu. Interesting layout allows you to watch the cooks plate up the food. This can either be a great experience or a fearful one. Good lord how many onions are being put on the sizzling plate? What is being poured out of a deep frying basket over them? I don't think this bodes well.

I ordered the half pound Beef Fajita. My sizzling experience was that of two cups of undercooked white onion, one ring of green pepper and a tiny ring of red pepper. Sliced Fajita meat that was charred and chewy perhaps dropped in the fryer? Tortillas which were completely uneven in thickness and sizes (I guess that means they are homemade, right?) They were almost too cold to fold and were damp from being steamed warm I think. EW. Still I was hungry and going to make this work. My condiment plates shredded cheese was fused together as if someone had scooped it partially melted with an ice cream scoop. The sour cream was plentiful but warm. I desperately wanted to add the chopped tomatoes to the salsa bowl, it seems they belonged there, but there were only enough of them for one Fajita so I didn't. The only way I was going to get these fajitas to be remotely tasty was request some lime. Fortunately I was able to secure some juicy wedges which helped. My partner said they liked the beef jerky meat, but it's not what I had in mind. At all. That's ok, the border dinner was sure to please them, right?

NO. It should have been left at the border and denied entry into the states. The congealed enchiladas held the fork in an upright position and refused to be edible. The charro beans were only edible if you pierced the plastic shell of dried beans on top and dug out some bite from the middle. My partner who loves rice didn't even scoop a bite of the spanish rice a roni provided. The dinner salad was a wilted ranch dressing mess and was useful only to put on one of my fajitas. I thought it would add some crunch. It didn't. We stared at the fried tortilla cup that held the queso. Under the skin the cheese heart was beating. Seriously, it wanted to live! It would shudder periodically as if something was swimming beneath the surface. Heat, I imagine, is all that made it percolate, but we had reached a stage in this dinner where we knew it was a bust and everything became fodder for jokes.  I am never going back and I thought others should know that Outback and Lone Star are in the same vicinity. Make a better choice.

$33 dollars. 

Wasn't it 33 pieces of silver that betrayed Jesus? These positive reviews were a Judas kiss, folks.We have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVER

I am talking about 9-10 years worth...Ulgh. We knew better. But we had a gift card. How can you resist $25 off your meal, right?

It was a Saturday night, peak dinner time. The place was packed. Well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. But it certainly felt jammed. That was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a Starbucks. To boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. Lots of crying babies.

I felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. She could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. However, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as I realized she sucked as a server. I can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. I was also thirsty a lot. 

Now the food... wow, the food. OK, it started well enough, kind of. First, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with EVOO and cracked pepper. That's it. No balsamic or herbs or salt. That would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. But it wasn't.

The blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. Blah, blah, blah. The only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. Everything was dreadfully underseasoned. My lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. It could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs. 

The whole meal was completely underwhelming, and I was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. Damn you, gift card.We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their "country comfort food" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants.The is a great junk yard, to get cheap USED parts for your Japanese imported vehicle. However, I DO NOT recommend their mechanics who service your vehicle. I used to be a very regular customer there, although not any more. I always felt like I was getting shafted in the end, and how ironic that I would have to go back to this mechanic every 2 or 3 months because something would "mysteriously" break down, like clock work. Then I got really suspicious when I agreed to have my oil and oil filter changed at this location. Not only did they replace my motor oil with the blackest (meaning worst) oil available, but they put almost a quart TOO MUCH, in the engine! I've had my brake pump, oil pump, brakes, and starter replaced there over a period of about 2 years. Along with a whole list of other repairs, too long to mention. They accept Visa or Mastercard, but only if it is associated with a DEBIT account. Good luck charging your parts or repairs on a credit card. Their card machine will mysteriously not work for CREDIT, but will work for DEBIT? Gimme a break. You're better off finding another mechanic, who will fix your vehicle. But it is a great place to find cheap used parts, because that's what it is: a junk yard. The owners are Turkish, and are very shady, they tend to speak Turkish to each other, when they are trying to scam you. Pay attention to what they speak, and what you don't understand.

Pros: They will attempt to fix your vehicle

Cons: They will over charge you, and something else will "mysteriously" break in less than 2 months!First off I thought I had already review Lai Lai but I guess not. 
Had I reviewed it I would have given it a solid 3.

Now I want to give it a zero. 

I don't know what happened but the Mongolian BBQ no longer exists. The hubs and I went in there this past Friday and it was all ripped out. 

They tried to get us to stay to order off the menu, which was just Chinese food...I reallllly wanted Mongolian BBQ. 

So sad. They are right down the street from us. No more Lai Lai for me.They gave me a quote of over five hundred dollars that included new rotors and brake pads for the back brakes. I took It to a mechanic I trust and was told the back brakes still had 75% life and rotors were fine. I ended up paying $189 for job. I would not recommend this business as I feel they are very dishonest.BEWARE: These guys will mess up your bank account, and will provide a horrible customer service to go with it. They will only sign you up for insurance without your prior approval.This place is A dive. Really surprised this place is still here. red neck heaven. Don't recommend this to anyone. Restrooms are filthy. They don't serve food. Just beer. Liquor.Terrible.  Sticky interior.  Incorrect order.  Orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze.  Kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice.  I didn't finish my egg roll.  Crab puffs were the best part of the meal.  Will not go back.Had a flat took it in to get fixed and they called and said both front tires couldn't be repaired needed to be replaced. I told them not to do anything ill pick it up because I knew that couldn't be right. The next morning I took the car to discount tire and they fixed both front tires for free!!! and no they didn't need to be replaced.Boyfriend & I were in Scottsdale for golf vacation so breakfast was a must. We went to US Egg, the Good Egg and Butterfield's Pancake House on Shea Rd. All three were better than BC. Sat down to nearly empty restaurant late on a Tuesday morning  when waitress finally came over , BF ordered diet coke and was told that they have Coke only. I ordered iced tea no lemon and got lemon and after I added a Splenda & tasted it it was fruit flavored which I don't like. When asked the server said it was black tea then admitted it was mango tea. So I said I'd just have water and after some eye rolling I finally got it. My tomato soup was ok but the grilled cheese had some burnt charcoal bits from the flattop. Boyfriend asked for cheddar in omelette and got  pepper jack(yuck) also asked for fruit but got barely warm potatoes O'BRIEN. More eye rolling when he asked for the fruit. This place seems to want to be a healthy hip place but with the bad service I got I wouldn't ever recommend or give them another dime.  Go somewhere eleHorrible service!!!
I was visiting from LA and we hav tons of hookah places. Since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude. After seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us. They had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down. I asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us. 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol. They put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes. I actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more. Then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink. He said ohh the kitchen is closed. I said well can I atleast get a drink? He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him. 
Service is the key in these kind of business. I guess that is acceptable in Arizona but this place would not survive one day in LA. 
Poor management...The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out..It's too bad you can rate a store ZERO stars. Dillards is by far the worst store on the mall - especially the shoe department. Every time in the last 2 years I have walked through, not one person has even looked at me. I tried to get a pair of sale shoes the other day, but they didn't have my size, and the girl told me there was "no way" she could look to see if another store had them. We send people to the moon and you can't even LOOK for a pair of shoes.This is a bitter review.  The place doesn't really deserve 1 star, but I was asked to leave by a bouncer, and when I opened my mouth to protest, he grabbed me and escorted me to the door.  There is NO reason for a bouncer to get physically aggressive with a non-aggressive patron.  This guy was a meathead, and even seemed to have some roid rage if I'm not mistaken.  When are bars going to learn that by employing these types you lose business?  I would never go back there, and that means anytime I'm with my friends we will avoid the place.  DIPLOMACY is the name of the game in bouncing.  If you must kick someone out, do it in a discreet, non-confrontational way (unless the person was being violent to begin with, in which case feel free to put him in a half-nelson and toss him out the door)Dear Ra:

Get over yourself. 

Just sayin'.
- AliciaWe went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.The products are "low class," and so is the "supposed' Manager ( female in cahouts with the male  owner)..As soon as a customer leaves the store, the OWNER males SEXIST COMMENTS about the customer. they have a good laugh at your expense!..how pathetic!!!!!

Paradise Valley?...some hopes...how about "The Twilight Zone?"Different name same garbage...this place stinks and should be banished from serving food.  You will know that it has totally given up once they change the name for  third time to one of those (ril)(fil) Abetos places...stay away for your own goodTerrible service. Very rude food server. Embarrassed to have brought my family there. Will never go back.Although the dental practice looks professional and clean, the staff was not genuous in their concerns of my comfort. Yes, they said what you wanted to hear but you can tell when someone is not sincere. As soon as I said I wasn't sure about coming back or my discomfort when I had my teeth cleaning, they called me everyday. Not to check up to see how I was doing with the tooth I originally came in for care, but to see how quickly they can give up my appointment to fit in someone else...Everyday at least twice a day they called and not one of those calls or messages were to ask about my pain on the tooth. That's when you know the dentist and staff isn't about your comfort and health of your teeth. Yes, we are all in business to make money but money comes  with success of making your patients happy not treating them like another dollar sign. And to be charge more than $1200 for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous.The only thing to say about Flickas is," Why in the heck can't you pass a health inspection...EVER". You can't even get hand washing rightUnprofessional, rude, and didn't repair my equipment in the time he said. 
I dropped off my broken subwoofer and he said it would be 3-4 weeks before it would be looked at. When I dropped it off he said it should be less than $175 to repair and that he would call if it was way more than that. This is not how you do business. You don't make repairs before first authorizing the amount. 5 weeks later I called and he said he hadn't gotten to it. He said that he had told me 2-3 MONTHS (he didn't). I picked it up to take it to another place that could get it fixed in a timely manor. He was rude to me when I picked it up and told me to get lost. I would not recommend that ANYONE take any sort of equipment here.Ok after reading all the reviews and seeing that it was split between 1 star and 5 stars I decided to give this place a shot with the help of a groupon.  I figured the 1 stars were just people being cheap well I was wrong.

Positives:  The service was good, enjoyed our waiter.  I had a blast with my wife dispite what follows.

Negatives:  The Food and the Price.  The food ranged from ok to terrible regardless of if it was free our the high prices that I paid.  

Oyster half shell:  Small with no real flavor= no Brine taste
Escargot:  No flavor
Shrimp Toast:  Lots of flavor and that flavor was salt.
Wife had Stuffed lobster and said it was ok if over cooked, so 3 star on lobster.
I had the Trout, I love Trout.  This was the worst trout I have ever had.  

The crowd here was mixed, but I got the feeling that the younger crowd was here off the groupon and the normal crowd is older and enjoys the taste of the food.  I could see someone with a different sense of taste loving this place.  

Now the Price is crazy I really should of just left after I ordered a beer and it came in a coffee cup looking glass and the Wife ordered a shot glass size Gin and Tonic for $10.   

I guess it one of those places you have to try once and we did, I just wish I didn't have to pay the $150 tab for fish I going to give to my Great Dane.

I do want to once again point out that the service was good.Played there a couple of days ago. Not impressed to say the least. Facility is in fantastic shape for oversseding this time of year. (mid october) We showed up at 6 am for our 640 tee time. (that's plenty to get warmed up, get a cup of coffee, and use the bathroom before teeing off.) Clubhouse was empty. Ya know that xmas story when they say... "Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse?" Yea, that's what it felt like. Finally, after siiting around for 30 mins, the pro shop opens. We pay for our rounds, and get 10 mins to hit some balls. 

*10 mins later*

We get to the tee box, no starter. Even the groundskeepers were running behind. Not a big deal, the guys were cool. With my limited spanish I was talking to one gentleman, and he was talking about how one course is down, and its a lot of work for them at the moment. I get it. They're busy, it's my day off, no big deal. The pace of play was slow, because each tee box we got to were being groomed, the tee boxes were on the side of the tee box, so we had to slow down a bit. Whos fault was that? Ours, of course. Golf course was in great shape, the views are amazing (I like Sun Ridge Canyon more, personally.)

*4 hours later*

Get done with the round, go inside for some food. Order drinks... 1 coke, an arnold palmer, a lemonade and a water. Server got 2 of 4 wrong. awesome! We order food, and the server says "Would you like to take care of that with a credit card or membership?" Well, in the REAL world, we wait till after our food arrives to usually pay... if you want a good tip anyways. Maybe I am in a different country it's otherwise... I answer I'll take care of it with cash. Here's his god to honest answer.

"We do not accept cash."

What?

Last time I checked, this is America, and it's safe to accept legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve, buddy.

Get the food, fries were the best part. 


Get the check and the 20% is automatically added. Wow. We had a party of 3... not 8 or 10, 3.... Three. no wonder there was bad service.

TL-DR?

The service all around needs to be stepped up if. It's too far to be treated that way. But then again, if memberships is all they want, maybe they've found their niche. Old people all around, a nd a lot of people who don't care. Nice business plan, guys!

I'll pass next time.From a scale from 1 to 10  I  give this place 1...We literally stood in the entrance for 15min and the hostess never showed up as people kept piling in. And the security staff standing there gave no explanation as to why NO ONE was present to seat people. Just stood there. So we left. I can see why it has such low ratings...I hate to say it, but seriously? You're going to have kids learn how to make sushi and send that to customers? It was horrible. Uneven pieces and falling apart--I paid for that. I can't believe I paid for that. 

The miso was nasty as well. Too many onions and the seaweed used in the soup was nasty. I'm always up for miso soup, but I will never eat anything like what they put in front of me ever again.

Plus, the service sucked. I'm sorry that I came in a weird hour (right about 2:30 pm), but why take a table if you are not going to stay for them? I have to say though, that I am kind of grateful that we ended up with a different server. The second one was actually nice--but couldn't even pronounce the words correctly. 

To top it off, they wear shirts that say "Miso Hungry," but one guy was walking around without the "ry" attached so it stated, "Miso Hung." 

Yeah. I'm never going here ever again.Got food poisoning here today. I have been here before and have been satisfied. Today though I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs. Since then I have been vomiting all day. Very upset this is keeping me in the house on a SaturdayI have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!We went here for dinner the other night and ended up wishing we hadn't.

The staff is very friendly and that's probably what keeps this place open. The food is bland at best and way overpriced for a little hole in the wall. I ordered a strawberry margarita and found that a strawberry had never been near it. Clearly a flavored mix.
We each had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. The shrimp had been so overcooked that it was like chewing on little lumps of plastic. The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned.
We left with a feeling of "Lesson learned."Bait and switch so much for free diagnostic.Agreed with the rest of the reviews which I should have read first. Steamed won tons dry, tough, and bland; chow mien noodles overcooked, bland, dry; shrimp tasted old and fishy and like the mud vein wasn't cleaned out; portion sizes on the small size for the typical Chinese restaurant although they were enough. I usually like to have some left for lunch the next day. Mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish.

On the positive side, we received 2 egg-rolls that we didn't order.

The price was probably average but very high for the quality of food received. 

We were quoted 30-45 minutes but it took about an hour to be delivered.

Overall disappointed and will definitely be trying somebody else next time.Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk.We had a layover on our family trip to Cancun today. We went out for Mexican food and found Macayos Cantina. I have grown up eating Mexican food and let me tell you this place sucks! The food tasts canned or processed,  its dirty and the staff looks dirty and unprofessional. They had no knowledge of how to make a Michelada or a Mexican Preparada,  weird for a "CANTINA".... the waiter just said "we dont serve that here bro". The chips and salsa as well as the rice and beans were old and dried out. Avoid this place unless you are looking to get waisted with a bunch of college kids.Tried to go in for lunch, a few days ago, and were told there would be a 15min wait for a table..at like 3 in the afternoon with no one else in the place..poor, poor form. Took it down the street and spent money, elsewhere. These are the businesses that are crying about the economy hurting them, when in reality it is their own service and dedication to patrons that falters.They have turned into social snobs.  My kids have been asked  (told) I do not want them to give this place any more money.  Unbelievable!!A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat.  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.

And to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly "recycle" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.

If you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.

Edit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:

1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)
2. Panda Express
3. Subway
4. Filibertos

As you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.  Please, just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else.Gross.

I love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.

No flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money.Ugh... watch out with that new Salmon Salad.. mine came with about 1/2 cup of oil.. ate the salmon, which was fine, and then saw the oil... took the greens home, hoping I could soak out the oil but it was impossible.. must be over 800 calories with all that oil.  $9 for a salad, pretty expensive, and this time, mostly wasted.. threw out the soggy greens when I got home.My boyfriend and I went in the store this evening and received bad service. You'd think they'd want to help push through a $5000-$6000 purchase, even if it is 30 minutes before closing...but I guess not.

We'll probably buy from Best Buy..they always go above and beyond.This place was a super big let down. Frozen fish squares? Cold unsalted fries? Flat pop? Frozen burger patties? And a burrito that looked like someone just popped open a banquet meal and pulled one out. The banquet would probably be better. Should have known the universe was trying to tell me to leave when they only take cash. It's the 21st century. Get with it. If you are looking for a better fish sandwich you'll have better luck at mcdonalds.This place deserves nothing. I got house chicken and chicken fried rice. When I got home to mix the two I bit into it and found a thick sharp plastic!!!!! I didn't really care because I didn't swallow it no harm whatever. Called them to let them know. Or see if they can fix the problem for me because we are starving and find this crap in our food. Thinking they give us a new meal and a refund on the inconvenience and  apologize for the object they yelled at me! They yelled at me. Are you kidding me? told me if I wanted new food they wanted the old food in full. they asked me how much of it I ate. Making it seem like there doing me a favor. Wth no. I found a price of plastic that could've had me choke! I had to stop my meal to argue with these guys on the food for 20 minutes. To find out there's no way out of this. I hung up because I didn't care enough to argue in circles. But hey if you want A HUGE SHARP object in your food that the restaurant will blame you for then hey this is the place to go!!!Not so good. Got very sick after eating the mahi mahi and macaroni salad.FYI Went there last night-1/22/2010---it was closed---I assume Alberto's is no longer.To call this fish and chips is SOOO wrong.  Its nothing like fish and chips should be.  Go to George and Dragon in Phoenix if you want real fish and chips.  Greasy squares of fish is disgusting.I love all you can eat buffet and the stake house the cafe restraunt I eat slots of food and I am still skinny I love that ever play machines there and sports ticketsI wish I could give no stars. I have literally had to call so many times to complain that I've stopped because it's clear no one there give a fuck about their customers. McDonalds corp just had the owner if this location call me and all she did was question me about all the issues as if I was the one who seemed sketchy. I even told them I don't want free food just get my order right.the first time I went here It was 115 degrees outside so I just thought it was the heat that amplified my disappointment in this place...   while 35 for this course was not a bad price at all, i wont be returning after this round... the weather was great, I was primed and ready for a great round....  that being said, I put my 3 iron perfect right down the middle of the first fairway on the desert course...    and then, i hit off of the fairway..... It felt like I was hitting off of the cart path.... or concrete... it was terrible...  this course is really not well kept at all, the starter backed up one of the courses for tee off close to a half hour... it was a terrible mess....  

after an errant tee shot on one of the holes i went over to the other fairway to get my ball only to see someone pick up my ball and pocket it... terrible golf etiquette... another gentlemen advised me that they were members and wouldnt do that...   just an overall bad experience.... avoid this one yelpers.... its not a good place....Called 1 week before the flowers were to be delivered.  The flowers never arrived and the staff had no idea what happened.  They blamed it on the guard at the gate and lied about trying to deliver the flowers and never attempted to deliver them.  Four days later the only thing that they told me was they would refund my money and hung up on me.  Paula, Pat and the deliver person Bobby were unable to help in any way.  I was unable to talk to the owner but judging from the staff this florists has some real problems.This is an unethical, unprofessional dental office.  They scheduled my son's follow up orthodontic appointment and when we arrived said we didn't have an appointment although I had the appointment reminder card.  Also scheduled an appointment to have his mouth-guard made for sports again when we show up, no appointment although we had the appointment reminder card.  My son's orthodontic treatment ended early but they refused to remove the braces unless I gave them $1000 (the remaining balance) which I signed a contract to have debited from my account monthly.  Stay away from Aliante Dental.I was referred by a friend to Sunrise Vet Clinic. The clinic is in a bad neighborhood and the building is run down. I have been multiple times and never saw Dr. Henderson. I have always been pleased by the service of the other Vets in the office. 
    After dealing with Dr. Henderson we will never go back again. He never listened to what I told him about my dogs. I told the Dr. Henderson multiple times one of my dogs was abused and may bite if you do not let him sniff you first, and to not come up from behind him.  Due to his horrible bedside manner and lack of listening skills my dog snapped at Dr. Henderson when he came up from behind my dog and grabbed him by the mouth.  Dr. Henderson called him a bad dog and walked out of the room. Not only did I warn Dr. Henderson, but this is notated all over my dog's chart that he may bite if nervous. My dog has never done this with any other vet in the office because they take the time the time to let him warm up to them.By far the most greasiest pizza I've had in Vegas. Total disappointment.Bedbugs... need I say more?  I woke up covered in welts... so did my buddies.  I guess we got what we paid for.  I'll never stay here again.  I would write a longer review, but the bedbugs just make it all moot.I'm only giving This review a one star because It wouldn't let me give anything less

So where do I begin?

I went Memorial Day weekend for a music festival and my anniversary this year. Already booked this room way in advanced for a way cheaper price and I shown up to pay triple the price. 
Because there was a music festival that caters to punk rock or alternative crowd, we and anybody that was hotel guests were marginalized to where wrist bands FOR THIS WEEKEND ONLY. Not that bad you say? Well this ensures that you can't bring ANYBODY to the room with you and if you do want to, then you have to pay $25 a wrist band just to visit. YOU CANT EVEN VISIT OTHER HOTEL GUESTS IN ANY OTHER ROOM!  that's right. My friend in the floor above me can't visit me. 

They also had this card system to operate the elevators. In which you are subjective to the floor that your staying on. 

For the room itself; it wasn't bad until I tried to flip some switches. Some of the electrical didn't work. Not that big of a deal. Looked in the bathroom to find a wet towel on the tub floor. And on the sink counter, I find CRUSTY, DIRTY PANTIES! No joke! 

I raised hell and all they gave us was $15 food credit in which it didn't work. 

I keep getting harassed about the wrist bands which fall off in the shower and tried to get me to pay an additional $25 to buy a new one when they had my name was filed as a guest. I've payed $400 to be marginalized, with horrible service and didn't even care when I talked to the hotel management with no sort of compensation. 

This is the worst establishment that I have ever stayed at with no regard for customer service. I've felt like I was forced to wear flair and we know what party made people wear flair. 

I'm never staying here again and I urge anybody that is planning to stay here, gamble, eat here ect.  To find somewhere else. I know about 2 dozen people that could vouch this review and had similar experiences.WAY overpriced!!!

Nothing was special about this place. And thats really sad because we spend like 350 for a couples massage for only 60 min... :(

the shower/ steam/ jacuzzi area was awful! i mean my gym has better amenties then that!!

Oh and the massage therapists didn't actually give you the whole time in my opinion...I think they included dressing time and stuff...lame..but not nearly as lame as the medicore massage that we recieved...ATTENTION: it's called pressure, and when I'm getting a massage I would like to feel some pressure...otherwise I could rub my own body thank you!! 


next time i'm in town i'm trying ceasers!REASONS WHY I DO NOT DRINK TEQUILA: 

i am banned here for life. 
yup. for life. 
uh huh... not just for Light... but from Bellagio. 

the VIP people don't know what they're doing. mainly because they combined our party with a bunch of crazy red necks without consulting us. we ended up getting into a fight with the red neck party and the security guards stomped on our heads while some of us were sprawled out on the floor. they completely did the WRONG thing and participated in knocking us all down, destroying my brand new LV purse (because it was covered in people's blood) and not STOPPING the fight. 

now, i'm no fighter. i CAN fight and have had training, but i'm more of a "let's work it out" kind of chick. not when drinking tequila. it is the devil. i... turn into the devil. 

we ended up being handcuffed and taken away by the Bellagio security. apparently... Light's cameras weren't working that night, so they had NO live or recorded feed of what happened or the fact that their bouncers were involved in the fight; not stopping it. WOW. 

view photo. that crystal bowl..? yeah, i smashed it on someone's head.Our non-smoking room smelled like stale cigarettes, the decor went out of style when Clinton entered the White House, and the location was inconvenient.First of all, I booked 2 rooms with a view 2 months ahead. I ended up with two pet stayed rooms with no view. Room was still dirty from the last visitor. Do not recommend staying at rio because of bad customer service. Will not stay here again.This place could be good. I wouldn't know though because we tried to go there last night and it was closed for a private party and today I tried to call to order lunch for pick up and they don't answer their phone. That's stupid!! The restaurants in the Rio are a horrible excuse for food, from what I've tried, and I was hoping this one at least would be good as we have to stay at the Rio for trade shows. Maybe some time I'll be able to try it. PICK UP YOUR PHONE!!!If I could... I would seriously give this place 0 stars! THIS IS A MEDICAL CENTER! You are supposed to be acting like doctors, nurses, etc... but I feel like I came to jail or something around that atmosphere. I have something to say about the front desk ladies.. on their faces they have a look of "I don't give a damn". Also, the nurse that called us in with short red spikey hair she had the same look on her face too and was super rude. Very rude service being that they are working at a medical place. I'm surprised I am even writing a review about a medical place.. shouldn't I be reviewing like a restaurant or something?! pathetic... If I was going to UCLA hospital, USC hospital, John Hopkins Hospital or another hospital in the world, they would not give me this kind of bad treatment. I don't know where these assistants/doctors graduated from but they sure don't know what they are doing or how to treat patients in the right manner. 

My grandpa went to go get a checkup here and the doctor said he was all fine and he did not have to worry about anything anymore. As soon as my grandpa got home, he finds that the doctor made a mistake and we waste gas by driving all the way down there again and that is when all the rude service began to be thrown at us. 

I suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please! I am doing everyone a favor out there. If you are sick or in urgent need.. rude people are the last thing you need to deal with!ordered the double cheese steak.  there may have been 3oz of charred grizzle in the sandwich which was greasy.  the chicken pizza with white sauce and tomatoes was a chopped breaded chicken patty.  The pizza was in editable.  called for delivery .25 miles away...took 1.5 hours.  when I called 45 minutes in, the lady said it was on the truck and hung up on me.  Avoid this train wreck.Stay away from this shuttle "service". Although the trip from the airport is fine and pleasant, we bought a round trip ticket at the airport thinking it was going to save time & money. Nope. I called in advance to reserve our pickup from the Luxor for our 6:05pm Sunday 11/13 departure and they told me that they didn't have any shuttles going to the Luxor for the entire day, except at 9:30 AM? WHAT?????????????????????????
THIS IS LAS VEGAS!!!!!! These people take your money even though they know they don't run all day. If this information was made available, I would have saved my money and just planned on taking a cab back to the airport. Which was the exact same price as the shuttle in the first place. Basically, save your money and if you are staying at a hotel at the beginning of the strip, just take a cab, it will cost you the same thing or nearly the same. I will never use this shuttle again.You really get to experience the flavor of North Las Vegas at this course....

Be warned that if you are in need of rental clubs, I guess you need to let them know way in advance. When we showed up on a friday afternoon, they asked if we had our own clubs. We were just in town for the weekend and did not bring any. The attendant just said "we're completely out of clubs" and offered no other resolution. I think they maybe had 2 sets of full clubs for the 18 hole golf course. Kind of ridiculous. Wasted cab rides to and from the course.

On the plus side there was a charming grocery store across the street from the course named Marketon (formerly King Ranch Market). They have great deals on chicken and make a mean soccer-themed cake.I was with my children at Meadows mall, and decided I wanted to have my favorite chocolate candy which is sold singularly and costs $1.50 and is usually set on the counter and isn't seasonal it's always there.  I asked the employee "SHIRLEY G." if they had any and she said yes and began to open the glass case I said no they are usually individually wrapped and on top of the counter and she said we have NEVER had those.  I said yes you do the only reason I know this is because it's my favorite. She said no no ! I said it's no problem are they discontinued. And she said "MA'AM I just told you we have never had those!" and yelled at me. I leaned forward a little and saw them in a plastic case being dusted or refilled on a back counter. I said those are the candies I'm talking about right there and pointed at them. And she said you didn't say that kind I said yes I did but that's ok I don't want it anymore nevermind and turned to walk away and she said "WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE STUPID ABOUT IT" I just kept walking. I couldn't believe that she number one yelled at me and number two called me stupid infront of my children. I found the corporate office address and will be writing a long letter to them about how disgusted with how I was treated.so eight years ago when I got married this was a good place, with a nice show in the front, and some statues and things at the entrance, it had a really nice medieval feel to it you know?

today it is just gross, they replaced the Merlin with Dick?  That is ridiculous.  anyway the casino is so smoky you can feel the lung cancer growing, even the smokers in my party complained (and they smoke 2 packs a day)

the beds were uncomfortable, even the cloths that I packed and didn't wear came out smelling like smoke at the house.  none of the other casino's seemed to have this problem.  I won't be staying at the Excalibur on my third trip to Vegas, if there is one.  

I will likely stay at either the New York New York, or Treasure Island, with the remodeling the Treasure Island seemed pretty cool, though the new show was not child oriented (though I wouldn't call it child inappropriate, it was borderline.)Horrible
That is how I describe this place. Check-in SUCKS . 30 Guest standing in Line but 3 employees working. Employees no smile on there face as if are forced to work. I only stay at this place just because my 2 small kids.
Nothing good about this place. No microwave and refrigerator. Wifi free but very SLOW.WOW..........all I can say is that the reviews for this restaurant under its original name Inka Chicken were so bad they change the name & took down the worst of the reviews. Bad, Bad, Bad, stay away unless you know the new owner personally, only then you might get good service & not get ignored. Don't be fooled Che Inka is the same place.Without a doubt the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.

My wife and I booked a room at this motel through Travelocity for our upcoming trip to Vegas. Their posting said 'pet friendly', so we booked the room and went about our lives. Finally the start of our vacation arrived and en route to Vegas (we drove) we decided to call Best Western Mardi Gras to inquire about check-in. My wife casually mentioned something about our pet and, whoa- turns out the whole property isn't pet friendly, only a select number of rooms are. You guessed it- our room was not one of the pet-friendly rooms and all of those were completely booked. So we were told that our room was now void since we had a pet. It's still unknown if the fault here lies with this motel or Travelocity but, let me repeat: their listing said 'pet friendly', not 'pet friendly with restrictions' or any indication that any other steps were required to identify we wanted one of these pet-friendly rooms. Ok, mistakes happen. This is not my complaint.

So here we are, en route to Vegas in the middle of nowhere and just found out we have no place to stay. Needless to say, our Best Western Mardi Gras operator was less than compassionate about our situation. When we asked if there were any options for us she just said no and hung up. I could blame the poor customer service on one individual but, after calling back and speaking with a manager, I received essentially the same. We were literally stuck in the desert, on our way to Las Vegas with no idea where we would stay that night. If we had Internet access (like the folks at the Best Western surely had) it wouldn't have been that difficult to find some alternative but, as we mentioned numerous times to our Best Western operators, we were en route and in the middle of nowhere.

Anyone with an even moderate degree of empathy or customer service could have:
A) contacted another Best Western property to see if they had availability
B) taken 5 seconds to find a local number for a kennel so we could inquire about boarding our dog and keep our room
C) advise us of any other local pet-friendly properties
D) contact Travelocity to sort the issue out (instead, we did)
E) none of the above but at least express an apology for the complication
...and instead, they did none of these.Food is ok and boring. It is a part of the Darden chain of restaurants so if you are familiar with Red Lobster, think of a Caribbean inspired version and you have Bahama Breeze. The drinks are delicious and really bad for you, and the food always tastes exactly the same; consistency is good. I have actually eaten here a couple times, but my last experience will have me never come back.

If you are looking for mediocre food in the array of mediocre food options near corporate Hughes center you could wind up here. Maybe you have coupons and you purposefully drove here? Understood.

My final visit to Bahama Breeze began with 2 coworkers and I walking in and standing in front of a host podium without being acknowledged. Three professional ladies, standing in an empty entrance waiting to be seated, until a couple minutes later a host (who never lifted her head from staring at the floor, I must have missed the carpet design) finally sat us. We were helped by a strangely hostile server who at one point through the meal had his manager come up to us and apologize for the wait for our food. This came as a surprise to us because he never mentioned anything about late food, and we hadn't asked about it. 

When our lunches arrived my baja fish tacos with a side salad had turned into baja fish tacos with a side soup. I enjoyed the soup and made no complaints, it was a tasty chowder with fried shrimp. Overall the food was unmemorable but not inedible. The service was terrible. I can't believe that every person I interacted with: host, server, and manager were not polite to outright rude. We were *told*(not offered) to get free dessert (or else our server said he would eat it? wtf?) but never received any apologies. Not for the late food, not for our shitty greet at the front door, not for our strangely hostile server, not for our late and incorrect food. Instead we got begged to take a free dessert. Sad. WTF guys, get your shit together.Living proof that casinos own public officials - a 3 day banquet for 3,000 guests from all over the world, and the food is an 'open trough.' It was disgusting, to say the least. Shame on the executives at the Wynn for not providing a healthy atmosphere to dine. At the buffets, there are sneeze guards, enforced by the health department. But not required at banquets, so not provided. The executives at the Wynn have the experience to know better. 

Seeing people laugh, cough, sneeze, and simply talk over open containers of food was primitive. Shame on the Wynn. Only classy on the surface.Two years ago I introduced my sister to S-a-F. We played $1 or $2 blackjack for hours, because that's how long it took the 80 year old dealer to get through one deck, lol. The pit boss came over and she had to be 90. We had a good laugh there. There's no ambience but if you like to play for cheap, it was one of the only choices remaining on the Strip.

I went back last year and, sadly, all the tables had been replaced by machines. It was early in the day, before the food vendors opened, and there was literally not a soul in the place besides me. No drink service, no cashier, no management. If you have a problem as I did, or need change or anything, you have to go out to Circus Circus, and their managers don't know anything about Slots a Fun's machines. It was a sad state of affairs and unless they turn things around, it looks like Slots a Fun's days are numbered.Wow, what a rip off. I recently went here during my visit to Vegas. If you want to pay an outrageous price for a "Fatburger" then this is the place for you. I walked out of there with a bill of $50 for 3 cheeseburgers and a greasy hot dog. The lady at the register had an attitude and i think that those prices should provide better customer service. Will never go there again. It truly is nothing special and definitely NOT worth the price!I'm not sure how good their burgers or pulled pork sandwiches are, but what I ordered was not good at all. I got the chicken ceasar salad wrap, which isn't difficult to make whatsoever..but they made it so wrong and distasteful I have to give this place a bad review. They put in carrots and zucchini and some odd sauce which definitely wasn't ceasar dressing in the wrap. It wasn't even busy when we came here and we barely got any service...the only thing I liked about this place was the french fries, which you really can't screw up so that's nothing to brag about.  I do not recommend this place to anyone unless you are a burger or other greasy sandwich lover.This place is horrible. Its one of those places that you think could be fun because of the movie. The idea is good, but the only people dancing on the bars our the audience. You can't just have your patrons dance. Something professional would be nice.Went to this restaurant a few years back and loved it! After going to STK and a few other places over the past years instead while in town, we thought we would give Gallagher's another try. What a disappointment. Tough steak....crap...Sam, the waiter was awesome, though and that was the best part of the visit. Shrimps were very good, but the star of the meal, our steaks...very sad, indeed. Won't return. Now, STK, that blew our heads off...should have went there again.We decided to stay in this place because its the cheapest we can get from expedia with only having a week before departure to book in the middle of the summer. The second floor hallway stinks. I wanted to get into our room to get away from the smell only to find out that our room stinks as well... a non-smoking room that smells like someone just had smoke? what the heck. I've been to other cheap motels but this is by far the worst.This was not our first time but it will be our last.  Drinks were fine, we were not offered bread. Two meals turned out ok but the 3rd was steak and it was ordered medium well. It was a charred, hard knot. We sent it back after the other two were finished with their dinner the third received the remade steak and it was RARE. Mind you it took 35 minutes to make a rare steak. When we received the bill, it had the steak on and off not once but twice, both with notations that the customer didn't like it. Hmmm, nothing about not making it right but blame the customer? Me thinks NOT.  We waited and waited and it was a week night, business dinner. We will not  be going back.Bad food and pushy waiter.  We hardly finished what we were served. My fish was heavily battered and the french fries seemed to be out of a bag- really fast-food under a plastic tree.It was very disappointing, I was told how great the pizza was and I was severely let down. I actually got up and left after I had my first bite. If you are a Vegas local and want a good pizza I would highly suggest you forgo this place and instead try Pizza My Dear or Grimaldi'sDo not shop Stein Mart, did you know that sexual orientation is NOT protected in there employee handbook. Do not support a store that doesn't support equal rights!I am not very good at wrapping gifts without them looking rather messy.  So, for a recent special occasion, I took the gift (a book) in to Alligator Soup to have it professionally wrapped.  
The store is crazy-packed with all kinds of generic gifts, greeting cards and such.  It was hard to even tell where the register was because the counter was so cluttered.  I was told it would be $7.50 for the wrapping and was shown some gift wrap to choose from.  I was very surprised at the limited choices of solid color paper, but selected one.  I was not asked about the occasion or the accompanying ribbon.  I was very surprised at the finished result - you could see the title of the book right through the paper.  I mentioned this to the lady helping me, but she just offered to move the bow.  No thanks!  I have had gifts wrapped at Papyrus before and the results were beautiful.  For $7.50, I would expect them to have a better quality paper or to at least double wrap it.  It felt like a rip-off and I don't feel as though the clerk really cared.  I wouldn't go back for anything.I had a very interesting experience at this location!  The girl behind the counter had a sense of humor, but it was a touch on the... ghetto side.  When I got done ordering my food she looks at me and simply says "No, you can't have that".  Ok, funny, ha ha.  Give me my f#$%ing sandwich.  

I ordered the Buffalo Wrap.  Now, I admit, I am not formally trained in sandwich manufacturing, but this item did not sound like rocket science.  Apparently I was wrong.  17 minutes later, and a really entertaining bickering session back and forth by the staff, my masterpiece arrives.  The wrap had a decent flavor - a bit heavy on the Buffalo sauce, but whatever.  They are getting 2 stars only because the wrap was good.  Not for service, not for humor.  

Best part is there was an older gentleman that ordered behind me that did not appreciate the "you can't have a sandwich" comedy skit and got into a bit of an arguement with the employee... to which she actually tried to defend herself.

Sorry, you get one shot - I won't be back.Poor customer service, and arrogant management. The cash registers also do not face to customer, so you cannot see the prices as they ring up the items, unless you go through the self check out lanes.While a few have had a good experience and most poor, I had to speak up about the living 'conditions' of these dogs that were witnessed upon entering the store. The cages are small and for the larger breeds who are past the 8 week old, cute, puppy stage-they seem to barely have enough room to stretch out and lay on their side. Part of the high prices and their success with selling the dogs at such a markup is because when you see them, you can't help but want to snatch them all up and get them out of those conditions and into a warm and loving home.  All the dogs had water, but I saw no food, and in fairness, I didn't notice too many dirty cages.
They did seem to be well staffed and no one in the store was rude to me. It's fair to say they were a bit aloof but it's clear for most of the staff this is just a job; maybe they just get indifferent after being there awhile...
Honestly, you have to think of this place the same way you would think of a shelter.  Your saving a life and giving each of these sweet little souls a chance at a good life outside those conditions, the only difference is you get to have them as puppies and pay a much higher price. 
All this said, Petland is a business and owners make decisions about how their business is run, so in a sense-it is what it is, and it is their right to operate in a way they see fit.  As a consumer, I won't be back because I prefer not to support a business whose practices I don't agree with. That said, for those that buy, bless you. You really are giving each animal at Petland at better life by bringing them into your loving forever home.It's been over a month, and I'm still waiting on the resolution of the double charging for our pizza we ordered. Not worth it if they make a mistake, because there is clearly no urgency to correct it. I'm not talking $30 bucks here. We were charged $124 TWICE.

Don't order from here. I wish we would have ordered somewhere else, eaten less delicious pizza for less money, and only been charged once. 

What happened to what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? This mess sure didn't.I would like to start by saying that I grew up in a mediterranean country and know this cuisine well. Paymon's is one of the worst attempts at mediterranean cuisine. The food tastes bad and their prices are crazy high, considering. Their dishes are usually soaking in oil and take forever to digest as a result. My suggestion, try Khoury's or Alibaba.Horrible service. Horrible food. Don't waste your time or money!So my friends and I went to Lupo for my friend Rich's bday. It was a first time for all of us. 
Now straight to the point I had a dry ass Penne Pasta (don't get it) but my friends offered me a sample of their food.  I tried the Sea Bass which was amazing, my other friend had the Braciola Di Maiale Alla Griglia, another had a pretty good steak but I don't remember the exact name.  We ordered sides to each meal which was delayed by far, they had already completed their meals by the time the sides arrived.  
We asked to speak to management he apologized for the delay in the side orders and comped my meal and took half off the bill.  
He also sent out 5 different types of desserts for us to try, yummy.
Overall the food was good but I would never go back there again.  Not my cup of tea.DAILY HOURS are subject to change.... Seriously?? If you're not busy you just close when you want? Ha! The posted hours that day stated they were open till 9pm, I arrived at 8:15 to hit 1 bucket of balls. To my surprise that wasn't happening, and the punk younger employee made it very clear "if we aren't busy, we shut down. Do you just expect us to wait around for customers?" - MY BAD BROIt's not really meant to be a negative review.  BUT--I happened to wander by today on my way to the grocery store, and they are no longer in business.There is not much to a smog check, so I have to rate this location purely on customer service. As you can see from the stars,... it was not that great. The guy running the place has a severe case of "small man" syndrome. In other words, he hates everyone because god gave him a tiny body, so he is forced to compensate for this by acting like he rules the world. I don't mean to dis the guy but he was a complete jerk. He was annoyed with every customer that pulled up (including me). The whole experience was just very uncomfortable from start to finish.  I will probably avoid this location this time next year when I'm looking for a smog check.Had a 1:30 Appointment today (5/21/14) with Dr. Baldauf.  Received a call around 10 that the doctor was in surgery and we could either see his Physicians Assistant or reschedule.  We opted to see the PA.  Got to the office in plenty of time, and was shown into an exm room at 1:40.  The nurse or whoever the female was that showed us to the room, asked the usual questions and her last question was, "And you are okay to see the PA?"  We said yes and as she left she said she will be right in.  At 3:20, Dr. Baldauf came into the room. My mother, who is the patient let him have it for her waiting so long.  He was apologetic in his arrogant way stating well I am in scrubs!  He wasn't interested in listening to what I had to say.  So it was decided that my mother would get an injection, which is what we had the appointment for in the first place.  He said his PA would be in to do the injection.  10 minutes later she arrives and apologies again for the delays.  When I told her we had agreed to see the PA instead of the doctor, she said she was with the doctor in surgery.  Well maybe this story works for spouses or whoever you are lying too but soneone really did lie here.  I would not take another family member to this group of doctors if they were the only ones left in town! Medicare will also here about the kind of service this office offers.  My mother is 91 and it was very uncomfortable for her to sit on that table for that long.  Think it might border on ELDER ABUSE!Carlos is the worst server there.  



I was sat got my drink and then waited 10 mins for the Guac that I wanted.  Mean while a table gets sat next to us and the place wasn't busy like it has been last time I went there.   The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.



This is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him.I signed up for the mailbox service in person, and when I did the female employee clearly stated "There is no other fee when you request your mail to be forwarded other than the postage you pay to have it sent to you." So I signed on for their 12-month service.  Gave them my credit card number to keep "On File". Imagine my surprise when I first requested mail forwarding and my card was charged an extra $5? When I called, the male employee on the phone said, "No, the woman misspoke. There is a $5 fee on top of your postage each time you ask for mail forwarding. I am the general manager," and proceeded to be annoyed at my puzzlement. Then he claimed he didn't have my credit card on file. When I insisted I had given it (how else did the first forwarded batch get to me??) he claimed that UPS must have shipped my last batch for free, since he couldn't find my credit card info -- all the while getting more annoyed at me!

When I insisted they had my card info and I didn't want to give it a second time, and I also wanted assurances that they didn't lose my info somewhere (!), he went and FOUND my original info. He had it the whole time.

So just watch out when you sign up for a service with this UPS Store, and check your bank statement/credit card for anything that looks unusual. They clearly don't train their employees well, if someone "misspoke" about a charge and got you to sign on. They are really nice in person but seem to be very disorganized, and I am wishing I didn't sign on for a year and entrust them with my mail :(LVAC is fun to work out at! Because finding your weights is like a scavenger hunt. They are (almost) never racked.

I'm not the kind that likes to stink up my car with post-work out sweat. I even put up with tne piss-scented showers and having to pay $0.50 to use the lockers (2 quarters).

What I do love is that if is fully a 24-hour gym including the snack bar that has a large variety of protein drinks.

It almost makes up for having he rudest and most unprofessional employees of any business of any kind I have made ever been to; no exagerations and all kidding aside.This place used to be decent but has recently had a complete turnover in staff and they all are pretty much useless. This heater in the pool hasn't worked in 2 years and I was told by the "corporate" office that they have mechanical issues. For 2 years? Really? We haven't had landscaping done in almost a year so now I've listened to loud leaf blowers and other machinery for 2 full days now which has repeatedly woken my newborn. When I called the office to ask about the noise I was told "well we have to do landscaping!" Shocking since its been nearly a year since anyone has done it. Our towel rack fell off the wall only to reveal it was being held up by caulk! Some of the maintenance people are great but others are completely useless. Security is hit or miss. The security gate is useless being that people sit and wait until a tenant opens it then follows them in. Or they wait until someone is leaving and darts in the exit gate. The garbage trucks show up at 6am and wake the entire complex. The noise level is steadily getting louder and louder. I will not be renewing my lease.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!

This has to be the worst hotel I've ever encountered. Between losing my reservation, having only 1 elevator that works (it comes every 30 minutes and most of the time is full), and a very RUDE security guard who wouldn't let me charge my cell phone at a wall outlet in the lobby and who physically accosted me, I will NEVER stay here again, nor would I recommend this place to anyone. The one plus is free wifi in the lobby that let me write this review.The rating is for delivery service, not the product. Haven't received yet so can't rate. Be warned Rc Willey delivers on their schedule. Not the customers. They give you 10 hour window for the day you choose so you better have whole day with nothing to do so Rc Willey can graciously deliver the item you paid for thousands of dollars + delivery fee. The day before the delivery, u need to make sure you go online (yes online) No one is goimg to bother to call you with 3 hour window time frame. Apparenty it must be up to delivery guys where they feel like goimg that day first. So you better don't make any plans on delivery day. Extremely unwilling to make it convenient for customer to have the item deliver.This time our experience got more  terrible then the last experience and each  time we  say we will give this place another try and its the same.......  We love the fried Pickles, but the real crapy service is now not wroth the 25 minute wait for drinks, take our order and the 30 minute wait for our check every time!

The owner must have his head 10feet deep in the sand, because while we were there this past time three tables walked out without paying and one with out even ordering after sitting there for 30 minutes........  Wake up and start giving us some service or the you going to lose customers forever!

You can only get better!I have never had my hair cut at Cha Cha, and I am grateful for that.  I was with my mother a few years ago when she had her hair cut here, and it was the most uncomfortable salon experience i've ever had.  i actually feel a little bad because she only chose the place at my insistence, as I had wanted to try it myself.  

Anyway, I don't know how you could make a simple bob look so bad, but I honestly think going to Cost Cutters would have done a better job.  The guy didn't listen to what she was saying, or else he was inexperienced and didn't know what he was doing, but either way, it was a terrible hair cut.  He also talked her into some "streaks" which were this hideous raspberry color, and looked like some 13 year old got into a bottle of miss clairol.  The whole time we kept giving each other worried/uncomfortable looks, as Mr Cool Tattoo (the stylist) kept cutting hair obliviously.  

Like a typical Midwesterner, my mom didn't say anything, but resolved to tell all her friends.No parking!!!!  

Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.

OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!  

Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a "Hi, can I help you?"

Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!

The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.

Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!

No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.

The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came. 

The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!! 

Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!This place reminds me of Fat Tuesdays.  It's a place where tourists and college students go to get nasty drunk but don't expect good food.  

The food is incredibly spicy but lacks quality and actual flavor.  It's as if they spiced up the food so they can sell you more margaritas.  If you wanna go just to get messed up on margaritas, which you kinda end up doing while you're waiting to either be seated or served your food, then the place is perfect for you.  

Unless you're a tourist - don't expect any decent customer service.  The place is an old mortuary redone into a restaurant.  It needs some SERIOUS updating, hell, just get a hose and wash the inside clean!!  It's sticky and nasty!I say I will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food, but I do it anyway, Maybe it is me hoping that It will be better the next time I go. It was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there!

Had friends in town visiting and they wanted to meet and eat there. We got there with a large group, and was told if we call an hour ahead of time, we would be OK. Wrong! It was a Saturday night and of course it was busy. So I understand that. The wait is not bad because of the bar outside, but $3 for chips and salsa? $21 for a pitcher of Ice and Sangria (more ice)? luckily there are comfy seats to consume the overpriced drinks with a bunch of grouchy hungry people! 

Finally a gentleman from our group went in and said we would squeeze into a corner booth if they let us. That is what we did. I did not mind the squeezing, actually it was kinda fun. But after we ordered the drinks and then waiting for a waiter who was a smart ass - It was getting old. 

The interior is cool, the booths are an old carved wood and with all the crap on the walls, you know there is some history. The patio is comfy in the springtime, but feels like the owners took their old patio furniture to work. There is plenty of places to sit, but it is someway awkward. Careful, You might turn an ankle on the patio with all the chairs.

Ordered the Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chile. I know this place is not a New Mexican style place. My family roots are in New Mexico and I know what is Hot and good New Mexico cooking. So I do not know why I expected that from my order. The food came and is was not a heaping large portion of rice and beans and entree like you normally get. I thought that was chincy. 

I dug into the meal and found the tortilla to look like it was a dyed blue, not a real blue corn tortilla! My wife's order came with rice and she barely got a spoonful portion. WTH? Where was the meat? The rice use to be hot too, but someone must have raised hell that it made all the food so spicy that there was no flavor. Now it is a normal mexican food place boring rice. Although spicy, everyone was on the clean plate club, not because it was not good, but because we were starving! 

One person in the group ordered the Tamale, and it looked REALLY GOOD! She said it was good. 

Dinner at 6:30 - it was not going to happen. We finally left at 9:45!
Everyone left kinda disappointed. I left muttering the same words... never again!Worst customer service I have ever experienced - unfortunate because the food was really good. After the waiter took our order, we never saw him again. Never came over to ask if we needed refills (which is necessary since the food is spicy) and didn't get everything we ordered. Pointed it out to the waiter, but still never got our guacamole and they still tried to charge me for it. Also, my wife had to carry her plate to the cashier just to get her leftovers boxed since the waiter just dropped the check off as he ran by.  If the service was even decent, I would be a frequent customer, but because the service was so bad, I won't go back again.Definitely not a fan. The food was so so. Not worth the price IMO. The service was also extremely lackluster. For a Sunday night with only 2 tables it sure did take an awfully long time for our food to come out. Our appetizers also came out after our entrees. My glass was empty about half the time. Even with a groupon I feel like we wasted money by eating here. I would go to PF Changs instead.Bed bugs!!!!!!! Bed bugs. My husband and I had to stay at the Stratosphere until our apt was ready to move in. I was in one room and everything in the bathroom stopped working we were switched to another room. I woke up two days later with what I thought was a rash at the time. I went to quick care and was told that the appeared to be Bed Bug bites. I went back to the room and low and behold there were several Bed Bugs I found. I immediately told the hotel manager and was moved to another room. I made a report with the security. I had bites all over my body that turned into these big dark spots that looked like little rashes. No one never inspected the room while I was there this was done days later. Security took pictures of my body in the new room. I had to buy all these different itch  creams, take all my cloths, bags, luggages, shoes ect to the cleaners to get steamed cleaned and washed because the only way to kill these Bed Bugs are by high heat. Finally risk managment got intouch woth me and said theu had some one come to check it out and it was negative sign of bed begs. I have pictures showing these things. The hotel didnt compensate me for all the money I had to spend to get rid of these bugs they offered me a complimentary dinner at the nasty a** disgusting resturant cafe these people are a fuc****  joke and im still suffing from the incident. This hotel is the fuc**** worst. Please please spend a little extra money and find a better hotel to stay at. The worst hotel in my life.Ive eaten at MANY Thai restaurants, and to me this was a total disappointment. I read the other reviews on here and was eager to try this place out. The portions that they served us were small compared to other restaurants that I've been to. We had the pad Thai and one of they're curries. I thought well their portions might be small but lets give them the benefit of the doubt, all i have to say about the taste is there a dozen more restaurants that i rather eat at. I DO NOT recommend this place at all. Its extremely Americanized, if you've never eaten Thai before you'll love it. But if you have something to compare it to you'll be disappointed!!!!Of all the places in Madison to go out, to eat at, to do anything at, why would you go here? (Especially when there is a line. Seriously.)There is an employee named Marcus who works here. He looks like a younger version of Charles Manson and is very rude. One day, he kicked me out of the store just because I walked in with a backpack and threatened me not to come back. I did contact the manager about him, but he never replied back, As far as I know they both still work there and I am boycotting this location until they are fired.One of the filthiest dirtiest casinos I have ever been inside. This hotel is so off my list I can not explain it ! The casino floor was so filthy dirty, empty drink glasses all over the place, full ashtrays everywhere, disgusting machines so dirty that you do not want to touch the buttons. When I asked the floor "key" person, he simply shrugged and said, "you can go anywhere you want, why do you come here if you do not like it?" Seriously- the bathrooms are so dated, you actually have to flush your own toilet, imagine that ! The bathrooms were also very filthy dirty, no one had been around them for a while, most were dilapidated of toilet paper or seat covers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME at this hotel !The front desk just called and said we were using too many towels! They said we can have three sets, yet the reservation was made for my wife and three little kids in a large room. We had asked for enough towels for each one of us--five sets. 

I've never encountered this kind of pettiness in a hotel. Never! And I've stayed in many, many on business. 

With all the choices in Vegas hotels, why would I ever come back here? I recommend the Venetian or Paris, where I've had great experiences.ugggggggggggggggggghhhhh... I will never visit this place again!!!!

1- You are on the complete opposite side of the strip
2- they are still charging a crazy amount per night
3- The rooms are old, and make me want to sleep in my car.

The hotel is very old. I did not have the best experience there. I had to call room servicer to have them change my sheets. They were not clean. I dont recomend this place at all.

But on a bright side i will give the buffett a 5 stars. I keep telling myself tht if i go back to Vegas i will visti their buffett. You pay I believe $15 or $16 per person all you can eat. But they have a pasta buffett where they will cook you chicken, shrimp, with any kind of pasta i personally loved it this must of been the best thing about the entire trip. The buffett highly recomended. To stay, defenitley find else where.Stayed here when I was 18 & it was great! The location on the strip is still good but 10 years later the hotel still looks the same :/ It's outdated & hello no working WiFi is totally unexceptable!!! The whole weekend we were frustrated trying to get some kind of Internet service! It was just horrible! 
Also our reservation was wrong & they gave us two handicap rooms with one bed instead of regular two queens in them. They did bring a cot to each room but that was not what was reserved! They offered us the choice to swap into the correct rooms in the morning but when we called @ 11 am they said rooms wouldn't be available until maybe as late as 4pm. We gave up since we weren't going to just wait around to move. We wanted to go have fun...which we did! 
Had a blast as always in Sin City but definitely would not stay @ Monte Carlo again!Saw Zumanity last week. Was underwhelmed as my expectation bar of a Cirque de Solei-branded show was set pretty high. As one of the other commenter's said, this was more of a cheesey burlesque revue than an dazzling acrobatic performance. 

When we bought our tickets (from Ticketmaster), I was only given seats on the side of the stage that were "best available" and cost the same as the seats n the front. 

TIP: DONT BUY SEATS ON THE SIDE - THE SET IS STAGED FOR FRONT VIEWING ONLY.The Mirage.  Where should I start?   When my wife and I checked in on Thursday night we were told that they upgraded us to a room with a great view.  Yeah an amazing view of the roof.  After calling the front desk they moved us to a different room,  this room does have a better view.  After getting into the room I have realized that the A/C, will not cool the room below 72°.  Then yesterday I went to get in the shower and the handle came off the wall in my hand.  Are you kidding me!  With the prices you pay in Vegas I at least expect a A/C that will freeze me out and the ability to take a shower with out having to schedule for maintain to do repairs.

I would strongly rethink I ng staying here if you have thought about it.This place is horribly overrated.  Service was terrible.  They act like they don't want you there.  It took 45 minutes between the first course and the main entree for the food to come out and not once did any waiter come by to check on the table.  Do not go.  Plenty of other great steakhouses in Vegas.The rooms are ok.  Seems higher up you get a better room.  Be warned...the staff will tell you one thing and you may get something entirely different.  We were told a strip view but ended up with a east view looking down Tropicana.  The room was clean and we had plenty of towels and such.

In a large hotel like this, you're definitely treated like a number and that's the way they make you feel.  Typical for the huge hotels in Vegas.  So sad actually because their prices are extremely high for what you get and the service you get.  Which is poor.

The room and floor attendants were excellent.

The pool is very very nice.  Go strip down to your swimsuits and enjoy the hot sun by the water.  Cocktail!  : - )

I don't recommend you do Valet parking if you don't have to.  The wait to get your vehicle on check out time is absolutely incredible.  I'm glad we didn't do valet as they suggested.  The walk from the parking structure is a long ways to the elevators to the rooms.  Security is constantly patrolling all the floors on the parking structure.  They get around pretty quickly on the bicycles.

I've seen the KA show now 5 times.  This last time...on July 17th...I was totally let down.  What a poor cast and poor performance.  I've never seen such a pathetic group of performers in the previous 4 shows.  What happened to this show and the previous cast!  DO NOT GO SEE KA!  For the money, we, the customer expect performance.  Something that makes you go.....aaawwww!  Wow!  I was actually furious at what I was watching.  What a let down to the key performers that were still there like the Mexican guys on the wheel.  They're consistently good.  More on this part of the review later.  I want my money back!  Jerks! to you Cirque du Soliel for a poor job!  You guys should know better and now it appears you're taking advantage of the general public by placing less experienced performers on the stage.  I'll address that with Cirque separately.  Not letting this go for the money I spent.

Although, the rooms were clean and safe...I just can't get past giving this hotel more than one star.  There's a few little things they can do to make this experience so much more for their guests.  Too bad more of the customers don't demand more for their money.

Too bad for MGM.For some reason they did not have my reservation that I paid for through Amex. They blamed Amex, Amex blamed them. At the end of the day, I paid and got a room but they took no responsiblity or even tried to make it better. No customer service, the people were mostly rude. The only nice person there was at the buffet. An ok buffet if you like buffets... but over all, this place is out dated. If Joel Robuchon was not there, I would not bother going there at all.  So many other great hotels to try at around the same place. My sister stayed across the street at the Tropicana and that place was way more updated than MGM and at a better price.Door was nearly impossible to open, key card never worked on the first try, light was broken in the room.We did NOT stay at this hotel.  We came in strictly to do two attractions, the CSI Experience and the CBS Television City Research Center.  Upon walking in we were overpowered with the stench of bad cologne vs massengil douche in the air.  Initially I thought this was a hotel perfume counter gone bad inside one of the shops, but I never walked out of the cloud.  It followed me all the way through the hotel, into the attraction, and in fact, was still on my clothes hours later.  

If you have any kind of sensitivity to scents, you will want to avoid this place for lodging, dining or attractions.  Rather than gambling here, you would be better off just giving your money to the oodles of homeless outside the place in the walkwaI've not been back to Las Vegas since 2002 in February, it wasn't due to a lack of interest just that it isn't a place I would take the kids, so we decided to not travel back so often... more then 8 years later the experience was less then grand and that was largely due to Treasure Island, which is not a treasure at all. The Manager at the front desk who listened to my complaints was kind enough to look around as I explained what I was displeased with; even looked at his cell phone a couple of times. The front desk manager was a younger guy, round in face and body with dark hair; he was the perfect example of someone who should be washing dishes or taking out the garbage because very simply he should NOT interact with other people. My complaints were about how we were greeted, to our room and continued on to the general attitude of all the staff. In every store we went employees were constantly checking their cell phones, not really listening to you or treating you with an "oh great an interruption to our conversation just walked in." I was surprised that the Manager had the same attitude, when I informed him that I would not ever return to his hotel, he simply stated he would give us a comp to The Coffee Shop or Buffet to our choice but didn't have much else to say. I was encouraged to go speak to managers of the different areas of the hotel I had issue with, but that was it. Please see my reviews of the other locations within the hotel. 

The hotel Lobby - No sign or indication where to check in, but the "Check Out" counter was HUGE and the first thing you see when you enter... I guess that is because people are more encouraged to leave this establishment then enter. Stale smoke was in the air, every staff member sighed, looked at their phones and tried to get you to leave quickly... for us it meant we had to return because we received the wrong package, and when we informed them we were told we couldn't be helped and we had to go to the Mystere counter and they would have not just our appropriate 2 free buffet tickets but our Mystere tickets, of course they took back the initial package they gave us with the 2 for 1 buffet and Cocktails. Our room was clean, the staff who cleaned was nice, anyone of them should have been promoted to manager, we were in room 6073. 

While at the Blackjack table, they increased the dollar amount while I was at it, later I found out when a table is empty they lower the minimum then increase it as soon as 1-3 people sit down, and at one point I needed to hit a cash machine and informed if I left I would lose my lower Minimum. I was lucky to see the cocktail waitress once an hour, and she would either get orders or drop off drinks, not both at the same time. So if she was dropping drinks off at the table and someone tried to order she said "No, I will be back" and she'd come back maybe 20min later. One of the dealers who was at the table though nice had a bit of a superior attitude and kept informing two British men who were playing that she deserved a tip, and would take a portion of their winnings and declare "That's yours this is mine" and pop it in her tip box, although they didn't protest to it never in a million years would I have put up with that. She didn't try it on anyone else, but it certainly wasn't appropriate. The amenities at the TI (Treasure Island) are nil, there are 4 places to eat that I saw, a costume jewelry store, Mystere (which has to be the worst Cirque Du Solei show I have ever seen (and I've seen 3 others which I loved). If I go back to Vegas I would NEVER return to this hotel, and I would also mention that most of the hotels now are owned by the same companies, which means there is no competition; if you stay at one and have a bad experience they just expect you'll stay at another they own. The TI is horribly located, has no real redeeming features and the staff from the front door, servers, bar tenders, restaurants all the way to the manager would rather ignore you then show you that they're pleased you chose to have a vacation in their establishment.If you like poor customer service with cheesy gimmicks (buffet coupons that don't work the nights you are staying, resort fees, and customer service that is too overworked to care, then this is the hotel for you!  From check-in through check-out, you will find long lines for registration a pool that is crowded and closes way too early, 7pm when it is 90 degrees outside! 

The only saving grace of this hotel is the poker room and the location, but far better hotels can be found for similar prices.This is by far my worse hotel stay-horrible customer service, old and disgusting rooms and elevators that don't work. In fact we got stuck in one! The restaurants are slow and their system always seems to be broken so they could not give us our bill! But by far the worse is the location of the shuttle pick-up. Impossible to find because its in the back in a creepy alley where it feels like you will get shot or robbed. No one knows anything or can answer questions. Basically ruined my vegas experience.For someone that says they are food allergy friendly they seem to be doing a terrible job. I have a really severe egg allergy and a gluten intolerance. After waiting 30+ minutes for our food it arrived, with bread, and mayonnaise. Seriously?? 2 out of the 3 dishes were just totally wrong. 

Our server apologized and told us in all of the time he had been there he had never had that problem. I accepted and prepared to wait again. 

When they brought out our food finally, it was wrong again. My chicken with apples and brie? No brie. Also a giant silver server of mayonnaise, again. 

At this point I was about to have a full on panic attack. I got about two bites in and realized that my food was cold. Since it was wrong initially I assume it sat in the window while everyones elses was remade. There was no way I was going to be able to comfortably eat this, since they clearly did not take food allergies seriously. 

They did apologize profusely and took a big chunk of the bill off, but it was the worst restaurant we went to for the 5 days we were in Vegas, we will never be back. 

I wouldn't leave such a harsh review if they hadn't told us from my initial phone call before our trip, and when we sat down at the table, that they took food allergies seriously and were more than capable of handling it. 

They need to go back over the system they have in place because it is not working.This is by far the worse hotel ever. We arrived and our room was dirty. The Flamingo isn't the nicest hotel but I expect a clean room. I told the front desk woman (Fran) and she didn't seem to care. The manager Frank gave us a free upgrade. The room he gave looked exactly the same as the dirty room. I called to tell him because I thought it was an error but he said the room has the same decor and its a few inches bigger. What happened to a good old fashion upgrade to a nicer room? They even offered additional days for more than the original reservation. Nice! By the way we used to go there every year for a basketball tournament. I will never ever stay here again. You get what you pay for at the Flamingo on the Strip.This hotel is in dire need of a refurb.  I was pleased to walk up and only wait in line 3 minutes to check in at 11:30 a.m.  Well, I now know why.  First, they charge an early check in fee.  I was in the hotel industry for 10 years and this was my first experience with such a thing.  To avoid this $28 early check in fee, I was given the option of paying $30 to upgrade to their hip "GO" rooms over their substandard rooms.  I say substandard, cause the last time I stayed in one, I wouldn't walk on the carpet barefoot.  Needless to say, the upgrade wasn't worth $30.  Holes in the lamp shades, burnt out bulbs through out the room, an ironing board the was bent and contorted to the point of uselessness, closet doors with broken latches so they wouldn't stay closed, a rattling air conditioner that never cooled the room colder than 74 degrees no matter the temp it was set on and the topper, a testing of their Emergency Life System over the loud speakers at 7:04 a.m.  

By the way, did I mention I was staying there for free besides the $30 I paid for the "GO" room?  I won't be staying there again for $30 or for free.  Oh yea, I just found that they charged my credit card $103 for something.  That should be fun phone call.

This place is a dump...At Vegas for the first time and although I foresee and thoroughly expect rudeness,degenerates and blatant alcoholics to come my way; I have never experienced such rudeness as I have literally JUST experienced from a customer service attendant( to whom I asked a simple question; " where can I find the restroom". ) to which she responded, " I'm pointing at it, can't you read, it says "" restroom""", to which I responded " oh I'm sorry, I've never been here, so you could've just said " around the corner and to the right". 

Vegas is designed to distract you from EVERYTHING, plus, you're given comp drink for gambling. I'm sorry if I've been enjoying my vacation. How about just say, " hey, it's down this hall and to the right." I'll find it eventually. 
No need to insult me or my intelligence because I am far more sober than most of these people. 
The end. Thank you. 

"Norma" was her name. Avoid her.Stay Away from this hotel!!!  I promise that you will regret it.   As we arrived to the hotel we had a bell boy help bring up our luggage to the room.   finding out a day later some of our stuff were stolen and of course the hotel did not do anything about it.   It always take almost 5 mins just to get an elevator.   The carpet in the room was really sticky!!!  It was so gross.   Customer service really sucked.   I am telling you right now stay away....   pay an extra 20 bucks more to go else where.I second the person who thinks that the hotel should be renamed the Suxor.

Yeesh, for the money they charge for a room this hotel didn't have -anything- on Motel 6.  The costumer service was TERRIBLE.  Massive lines to check in. We had to switch rooms because the Pyramid room we got first was falling apart.  Seriously, falling apart.  (laundry list of craptastic-ogasmic-ickiness: shower faucet handle pulled out from wall, AC filter on floor under AC,  TV remote did not work, TV had missing buttons, no wireless despite advertising wireless.)

Dingy, Dirty, Dilapidated, Destitute.

I've stayed in many a nice hotel over the years.  This was not one of them.

By the way, if you've ever wanted to find out what it's like to live in Orwell's 1984 the posters of Carrot Top everywhere have that creepy Big Brother feel to them.  No matter where you are in the hotel our benevolent dictator Carrot Top stares down upon us.  All is double plus good at the Luxor when Carrot Top is around.   He is our benevolent leader and shall prevail in the war against our enemies Eastasia and Eurasia (Mandalay Bay and Paris respectively.)  The Ministry of Great Customer Service provides for all.   Less rations this year mean more than ever for citizens.  All is double plus good.  The Ministry of Truth  wants to remind you that Inclinators are double plus good and a triumph of the Oceania Ministry of Peace.

FYI should any MGM big wigs ever get their dirty little hands on this review... You've got one of the coolest (and timeless) exteriors on the strip in the Luxor.  An onyx black pyramid is never going to look bad.  Take a clue from the W hotels and make this place feel as cool as the outside of the building looks.  Dump the earth tones, PAY people to maintain the rooms (I know, crazy idea, but apparently customers aren't fans of holes in the wall and broken amenities on $250/night hotel rooms), and lastly, treat your customers like you want them to return.Stayed here on a business trip. I took off a star because there is no in room Wi-Fi. Then I took off the the rest of the stars because there is no in room Wi-Fi. How is there no Wi-Fi? Also the water pressure in the shower was pretty weak.For 4 months I've been going back and forth with Mandalay fighting their $43.24 AND $21.01 double charge on my credit card for the in-room Grey Goose bottle (which I NEVER touched) and resort fee, respectively. 

These jerks disputed my claim against them by sending my credit card company a receipt for these charges...um, ok? Like a receipt process anything? 

How about you look at the fact that none of the overpriced drinks and foods in the snack console was ever handled??? (I know that the slightest touch signals the sensors so we just stay away from it completely). Or how about you look at my original purchase and prepaid resort fee from Expedia?

I HATE YOU MANDALAY BAY, YOU CROOKS! wasting my time trying to get this fixed and STILL trying to resolve (I'm literally on hold with Amex as I type).I'd just like to start off by saying I came to Vegas celebrating my birthday with a large group of family this past weekend. We had heard great things about this restaurant and since we were staying at the Hard Rock hotel, we figured, why not? Arriving to the hotel from a long drive, my group and I were beyond hungry. As expected at a restaurant on a Friday night, we did expect a wait to get seated and for the food to take some time. First off, we had waited about forty-five minutes to more than an hour to receive our food. But before receiving any plates on the table, we had asked our waitress how much longer we had before our food came out. No reply or acknowledgment. The waitress ignored at least three of my cousins who asked and walked away. We kept waiting with our growling tummies until another cousin of mine walked in to ask another waitress. That same waitress spoke to her manager and from reading the manager's lips, he said "fuck it." Whatever that meant, it confused some of us. Soon after, another waitress who apparently was a manager herself barged in to our sitting area to check out what the issue was. We told her and responded with, "Smile, youre in Vegas.... bitch." Regardless whether you're in Vegas, New York City or Los Angeles, there is no need to wait over an hour for mediocre food. Or to even receive that type of attitude/service. Mind you, when the food was finally sent out, it tasted as if they warmed it up in the microwave. End of story, horrible service, mediocre food, poor management. Pink taco needs to step it up, "you're in Vegas!"I was going to rate them with two stars till I went back to my hotel at the Embassy Suites and got a better free margarita than what I just paid top dollar at Pink Taco.  The food was half a step above Chili's. I hate Chili's!  Hard rock is supposed to be a cool place to visit.  One really cool thing is good food.  They missed the mark big time.  Stale corn chips with salsa is a crime.  We may need to get Gordon Ramsey to do an emergency kitchen nightmares.  It's all about the basics.  Bacon wrapped jalapeños sounded great but missed the mark.  Chili  reallano was a big chunk of greasy cheese.  Not good. Will never go back.Food is blah and Waaaaay overpriced!

Service: good, but our head waiter was a talker. I would like to start eating my food before it gets cold, thank you. However, very knowledgeable about the food and prompt with refilling the water.

*BEWARE if you order the "FLAT" water, they charge $7 per bottle of water (and the bottles don't carry very much water)

Food: Had the Croque Madam, it was not seasoned at all and they used A LOT of butter.  It ended up being a big pile of soggy mush with a hint of ham.  Also had the French Onion Soup, which was very good (only because I LOVE Gruyère cheese), but still overpriced at $9 for a cup.  Also tried my friend's Mac and Cheese Gratin, where's the Cheese??? It was REALLY creamy and soggy, but I couldn't detect any cheese whatsoever.

The Bill: We came in a large group of 8 so they automatically tacked a %20 service charge on there, fine.  But with a closer examination of the check, they also tacked on a $40 RESTAURANT FEE!?!?!? So they're charging us just to eat here? WTF?

F YOU BOUCHON, F YOU!Went to this restaurent with the family while we were in town to see Phantom of the Opera. The service was quite good. However, the dishes tasted nothing like French. I ordered the Chichen. My wife the lamb. My dish was way too salty. My wife complained that her lamb was very bland, over-cooked (she asked for medium rare), and tough. My kid's Croque Monsieur came with a huge pile of fries, which was also way over-salted. It seems the chef got his or her salt for free and would not hesitate to use it liberally. Overall, it was a big disappointment after reading the good reviews.This place gets decent reviews from other people...maybe the time I went was an anomaly, I'm not sure.

Anyway, I did not have dinner there, I was only there for clubbing. It was so dead it wasn't even funny. I would say the place was 30% full on the Saturday night I went. Later I was chatting with a local at another club and she told me that place used to be HOT but it's so bad now they should just shut it down (the club part).Walked to entrance and there was no one there, no one eating and just didn't seem warm at all. Maybe if I was at spa this place might have been appealing.This place is not good at all.  I was there last weekend and let me just say there are plenty of other late night options in vegas.
I would even rather go to a fast food place.  

I was here with a few friends and the service was horrible and the food we ordered didn't taste right or just looked weird...like the chicken in the salad that a friend ordered.  As for my corn beef and hash, it came out warm-cold and was too salty.

I have no clue what was wrong, but the waiter kept telling us it was the grave yard shift chefs that were the cause of our problems. 

Also, my friend got sick from his salad.  To be fair we were in vegas and it could have been the alcohol, but I have my doubts.What a fucking joke.  This place sucked.

First off, they rope off every section in the damn place so you only have access to the bar and the 20x20(ish) foot dance floor.

Apparently you have to spend a lot of money for bottle service to even be allowed to sit down on a seat.

On a good note, the bathroom was like a drug store.  The ladies inside were VERY nice and had every fragrance, soap, drugstore item available that you could ever need!

Oh, and they were charging me (per my receipt) $14 for a premium Martini + $3 Martini Bump.  WTF is that?  I was paying $17 for a Belvedere Martini.  What a joke... and I don't think they were really even giving me Belvedere.  I woke up with a headache which NEVER happens when I'm REALLY drinking B.

Ladies were free to get in on Sunday night, Men were $25Pure sucks. Pretentious + Claustrophobic + Over-hyped. The dance floor is way too small. The lounge is way too big. I can't go 3 seconds without somebody bumping into me. Yuck. Go somewhere else. See how many times you can count their name all over the walls. Ugh...This place is 100% authentic.....if your standard of authenticity permits the use of Oscar Meyer hot dogs in a German restaurant.

I can't believe people think this place is good. I remember going there with a friend. I started off with a German salad. It sucked. I felt like I was eating a turd salad. When I received my entree, we both kind of looked at my plate and my friend acknowledged before I could say anything that it was indeed a hot dog that had been placed on my plate instead of a German sausage as advertised.

I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.

This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!

I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.

And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard. And don't forget to play some annoying German music and sing "ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy".Run.  Run quickly over to NYNY and get a slice of pizza rather than waste your money here.  Hubby and I got a deal thru tix4tonight and decided to try this buffet.  Mistake.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up mashed potatoes-HA....they did.  Disgusting.   I'm not one to waste food but I cannot eat this.
Run away guys.  I am still at the table while writing this, that's how vested I am in saving in you from repeating our mistake.I was at The Buffet and was happy as always..I love buffet and heard this was the best one in las vegas.  So a  me and a few friends waited in line for almost 2 hrs before getting into The Buffet.  Excited like a little kid in a candy store until a friend found a worm in the food.. YES a worm and it was trying to make a run for it.  The worm was still moving on his plate of food.  All of us stopped eating and report this to one of the worker hoping they would do something about it. The only thing they did was said the manger is busy and for us to take our money and leave.  So to cut thing short no way me or my friends will eat there again.  My friend record the worm moving on the plate and yes it will be on youtube and face book.  Can believe Bellagio would allow something like that to happen and do nothing about it..SO SAD!!!!!Richard Pro here with another review. I've had extensive experience dining at Las Vegas buffets for the past seven years.

Back when this hotel was Aladdin, the buffet was unbelievable. You'll see outside when you line up all the awards the buffet has won. Sadly, this is all in the past. The buffet today at Planet Hollywood is awful and nothing compared to before. The dim lighting had always been a turn off to me, but the food used to be so amazing and unique that I had to come here every time. Now I don't make any stops at this buffet during my annual trip to Vegas in December.

Taste and variety leave much to be desired. Food here used to taste like it was made by a real chef. Now the food tastes like something anyone can make. 

One star. I hate how the buffet began as king, the best on the Strip, and transformed into a place with terrible food.What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concernedThis was my first Cirque show, and we went so long ago.  This show traumatized me so much that it took me 6 years before I could watch another (O)!  I hate how other people in the audience pretend to enjoy watching clowns or whatever bouncing on big inflatable balls or understand the "story" line, which I believe is non-existent.  

The one star is because it was slightly entertaining due to bottles of wine consumed just prior to the show...I'm confused, but amazed at the same time. I loved it, and hated it at the same time too. I am conflicted. 

The people were amazing. I can't believe they did some of the things they did. True athletes. 

The problem: I was lost like I didn't know if I should be getting something or if I was missing it. To many buff men getting to friendly with other buffed men scared me a bit. Some of the costumes were also hard to look at. 

In all seriousness. It was awesome and am very glad I got to see a Cirque show in Vegas. Next time, the Beatles.  This overall was a dissapointment and waste of money (see the confliction) ..... thus, one star and I can't recommend it to anyone and would never go to it again myself.Good music and nice interior but horrrrrrible security staff. Super rude and pushy. Nowhere to stand without getting yelled at to keep walking.. Unless you drop $2000 on a table good luck getting treated like a regular person. Wouldn't go back after how I was yelled at for not moving fast enough away from "VIP" sections.. Guess I'm to regular chicagoan for all these bottles and bullshit. Ps dont bother with a package. We did and it wasn't worth the 1 hr open bar considering the shitty ass treatment we got..So here's the deal. I upgraded to the suite this weekend with the thought that it would be nice to spend some downtime in the room. What I've discovered is that they charge, a lot, for everything. Want to keep beverages cool? $35 per night for a mini fridge. Want coffee in your room? $4 per keurig cup. Who charges for in room coffee?

Rooms are average and the tower location is away from all the hotel amenities which are located at the Mandalay tower. I really regret "upgrading" and wish I was in a smaller, cheaper room in the Mandalay Tower. 

I do not recommend THE Hotel.Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.see Love instead, O is highly overrated.  Would never see it again even at half price.Huge disappointment.  Years ago Caesar's Place had one of the best Buffets in town.  You can image my surprise to find how small it has become now.  They did have frozen crab legs, prime rib and turkey but that was about all they had.  The salad and side selection was very thin.  You can get a nice meal in one of the other restaurants for about the same price.Caesar's Palace is a world known hotel & casino. Now it is known as the worst and most disappointing buffet in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The selection is very small. What is served is not top notch but quality of a Hometown Buffet for $30 per person.

Why would anyone go to Cafe Lago Buffet?  Because the allure of Caesar's Palace first class aura.  Don't be fooled and lied to by employees who post here.  Lagos will disappoint and insult you for paying for what you will never get.  Service is Off and On.  Undependable.  I was warned and did not believe. Now I know that I will not recommend this POS in Caesar's Palace.  You can dress a dog and make it stand on it's hind legs but it is still a dog.  Apologies to all dogs but not about Cafe Lago Buffet. 

Lago is all about the con games played out.  Bring you in and flip you for being a fool.  So don't be fooled. Go anywhere but here at Lago Buffet and be happy, not sad.  I'm serious!What an incredible disappointment !!! A few months ago I purchased an auction item for St Jude's children's hospital , it featured 2 nights in a Luxury suite at this "hotel"...
With breakfast etc... I live  in Los Angeles  and as an active member of  The charity it seemed right to bet on this deal and come visit my Vegas friends, I invited  the manager of a CVS pharmacy, the CEO of a major Coaching company, and a lactation expert in a Summerlin famous hospital, along with 3 ,17 years old ....their kids...A very civilized and educated group of people who came to have Thai food with us in the Tuscany suite of 2000 sq feet with a large dining  table that seemed to be " inviting"....in Any case after 20 min in our dinner , as civilized and normal as could be , 9.20pm someone knocks at that door , my husband sees those 2 men, one claiming he received several complaints from guests about us making too much noise to which all of our faces dropped !! How could it BE? Were we in the famous Las Vegas on a Sunday night November 10th  ?? No School on the 11th right ? only chewing our foods and laughing here and there to our friends jokes. By the way they all intended to go back to their respective beautiful homes early (and  decoration-wise much prettier than that overdone Rococo suite) .... I think that this pretentious hotel thought we planned on ALL  sleeping there ! What a joke! They kept on coming back and the 3rd time planned on getting my non-registered guests outside the room cause they were now 6 men, 2 of them in yellow plastic suits claiming to be security ! My friends and I  took our phone and started filming ,which immediacy calmed them down ... I forgot to say that we are a group of 50 year old people and our kids were there NO WE MADE NO NOISE!!!! A DINNER that left such a bitter taste to my life after my guests heard twice they will be asked to leave!!! We all left!!!
 I feel that The Green Valley Ranch is the worst experience I ever had.... Very disappointing to look forward to a nice and relaxing 3 days week end in a "luxury " hotel and get a very angry little man, telling us to behave or else .....  It is the first time in my entire long life that I have been subject to such a treatment.
I have been a fan of the red rock hotel for a long time and stayed at the top floor suite for events, and parties  ,many times ,This really does not reflect right on the owners of the stations nor to their commitment to their guests.

And guess what... I left a message at the very apologetic reception desk asking for a follow up from someone different than the angry power tripping man in charge that night (after all I left  after 5 hours instead of 3 days )

No news.....!



.
.All the clubs at encore & wynn are beautiful.......but that's about it, the poor customer service , attitude of the employees that work there is outrageous. I'm surprised they allow them to run the place in this manner treating guests the way the do. They have treated my friends and I completely unprofessional in multiple occassions. They act like the place it's the big deal, when you go inside it smells and the music is terrible!  Doormen are completely incompetent and totally lazy. I avoid all these clubs at all cost, they  will put a sour note on your night, will much rather go to tao, marquee or blue martini anytime.We were invited to a great night at a private table paid for by a great company, then we were denied to go in when we were placed in the wrong line (all 6 of us). I tried to have the bouncer help us find our party, but was denied. We had to leave, & the company that we were to meet lost our business. It was a terrible experience due to poor service provided by the bouncers that were unprofessional and wouldn't take the extra step to help us find our group that had paid to meet with us for what would have been the beginning of a great new business opportunity. Don't go to this place to try and impress clientele, the company lost our business & so did Wynn. I will never refer any friends, family or associates to go to this place...ever! This place was degrading  & embarrassing, please don't go there. They were so rude to us! Respectfully...Concerned Business MgmtOutside of the view . . . well it is just too contrived.  Given the pricing I would expect more . . . like maybe a table cloth . . . like maybe if you sell me a beefsteak tomato salad how about some beefsteak tomatoes . . . not grape tomatoes, not yellow hot house tomatoes and hey how about some reasonable blue cheese . . . instead of the minimal square of lifeless shit portrayed as blue cheese.  The steak, bone-in ribeye, was decent although dry aged . . . for how long 2 hours . . .  well at least the sauteed mushrooms met my minimum standard

Completely disturbingly unsatisfying . . . 

In my week of extremes . . . $6.00 lunches versus $90.00 dinners sans drinks . . . well the truth is the lunches crushed the food at VooDoo  . . . poor pretentious bastards.

OMG . . . was I that brutal . . . and it was not even a real estate company . . . Well, IT SUCKED . . . but the view was outstanding  but the view is better taking off from the airport and a flight between Vegas and Southern California can be had for less cash.Worst bar ever! Bouncers were rude and mean. They were pushy and just nasty. The cigarette smoke was so bad and the security staff were busy smoking and shoving into people spilling Payton's drinks. And it was not crowded inside. We ordered one beer and couldn't leave fast enough. Don't waste your time, money, and lungs in this horrible overrated bar!!!  Yuck. Took three showers to get the smoke out of my body/hair. Clothes wreaked.Stopped in a couple Saturday's ago for brunch. The place wasn't that busy and we were seated immediately. Our server came over with water for the table and asked if we would like something else to drink. I ordered o.j and my girlfriend got a bloody Mary. After about 10 min the server came back to take our order for food and I asked about the drinks. He said he would go grab them after he took our order. 10-15 min after placing our food order we not only had not received our drinks but now our water was gone. Finally the drinks arrived with the food. Upon asking for our water to be refilled the server gave a grunt like i was bothering him!? The food was "ok". Not great but also not terrible. There are many other places I can go and spend my money and get much better service and food! This is a place I will not be visiting again. Ok food but terrible serviceOh my god!
What a complete shithole this place is!
It wasn't my choice to stay here,but I figured for 3 days,it couldn't be all that bad.
I don't mind if a hotel is older,a bit run down and such as long as the rooms are clean,stuff works the way it's supposed to and it's relatively safe.
I'm not moving in,just laying my head down for a little bit.
So I'm not all that picky when it comes to random short term hotel stays.(which explains my lack of hotel reviews here...)
Let's begin...
The place is in downtown Las Vegas as opposed to the newer,glitzier "strip".
It's anchors the "Fremont Experience"which is overrun by pickpockets,pimps and pushers.
Into the hotel we go....
Check in process. We get in line behind 2 other people waiting.The one clerk is slower than ice cubes freezing and the other one sees the line getting longer by my arrival.
So what does he do?
Closes his window,that's what!
So now it's just the one extra slow guy.
We're on line waiting when an entrepeneur(read shady looking character eyeing up the luggage)enters and trys to see what the pickins are.
Security starts to eye him as he's eyeing my luggage.
I start to eye security as they're eyeing the eye guy.
Eye guy decides to go eye someone else,and I slowly make my way to actually check in.
The elevator ride is interesting as some guy tries to explain to me that the hotel stole a thousand dollars of his and so now he's asking me for money....Yeah,no.
I get to my room,and it's a decent size with a decent view of a dismal Fremont Street.
It did seem clean enough though.No bullet holes or blood spatters so we're ahead of the game on that level at least.
The shower doesn't work in any legitimate way.It took about 20 minutes to get the water to not be scorching hot.
No fridge in the room which means I'll have to get back on the elevator more frequently than I care to for perishables.
The first day,there's a stabbing in the garage.
The victim bled to death on a colleague's car,and his car got impounded as evidence.
The second day there,another colleague got his wallet stolen by a pickpocket in the hotel.
The same day,someone had a purse snatched from the casino.
So much for security...
The next day,homeless folks wandered into a hospitality suite for the event I was attending(which was on the 23rd floor)to partake of he buffet and ask for money from varoius attendees.
Later that day,I was getting into an elevator with a security guy who was saying into his walkie talkie that he was going to room such and such for a "wellness check"...
Anyone in "the business"knows that means what he will find is anything but "well".
So on my way back down about an hour later,the bag and taggers are removing the dead body from that "wellness check "room.
Yep,the same security guy was in the elevator and even let me get on with him,the morgue boys and the deceased complete in body bag.
Fine customer service right there!He was so thoughtful to not have me wait for the next available elevator...
I travel a lot and sometimes it's not to the most haute destinations,but rarely have I found myself in such surroundings.
I will not be going back to The Plaza Hotel anytime soon.Next time, light some candles and play Marvin Gaye before you screw me.

I've been here before, but for some reason I decided to give it another chance.  Kind of like that ex-boyfriend who dumps you but then happens to call you out of the blue when his friends are visiting (he wants to show them he's dating someone really cool) and tells you to wear heels and a short dress and then introduces you as his trophy GIRLFRIEND but dumps you AGAIN when his friends fly back home and you end up feeling even WORSE than when he dumped you the FIRST time.  

Phew, you catch that?!

Anyhoo... this is the second time that the hostess wouldn't seat us outside when all of the tables were available.  Pretentious waitstaff, rubbery pizza, wilted salad, tasty bread (but they'll only bring you one piece, so grab a big one from the basket), prices in line with the area but NOT justified by the lack of quality fare.

I should have learned my lesson the first time.  

--end rant--

The espresso bean gelato was delicious.To begin; The only reason I gave them 1 star, because if you want to wright a review on yelp you have to give them a star. My wife and I,  wanted to try a new buffet. We always preferred going to the Excalibur buffet. 

Guys, its really expensive and the food is not that great. To be honest, there was nothing that i actually liked. Most of the food was cold and very mediocre, hometown buffet or even the salad bar at sizzler is way better than this buffet. The pasta bar was not good at all. They had meet ball with marinara and the meet balls tasted very funky. I do have to say the desserts where just OK. Like the carrot cake was dry and they put to much orange zest, it actually made the cake taste like and orange cake instead of a carrot cake. I do have to say that the service was really good, Sandra our server was very attentive of us, bringing drinks and picking up or dirty plates. 

So in conclusion, just go some where else. I mean honestly there's a lot of buffets in Las Vegas specially on the strip. Sorry Wynn buffet, but you guys really need to re- analyze your buffet cuz the food was not even good.Did I miss something? Was I not supposed to go to their lunch buffet? Because it was horrible. I was looking forward to trying the Wynn buffet ever since hearing about its rave reviews. Unfortunately it did not hold up to our expectations. Yes, it's a very cute and dainty place with its colorful fruit and flower decor. It's well lit and kept clean. The lunch variety was lacking and composed mostly of starches (pizza, pastas, stir fry). I was extremely disappointed. The only thing I thought was good was the noodle soup made to order and their gelato bar. For the money we paid, I was expecting some shrimp cocktail or ceviche. There was none. A bigger issue we came across was the fried chicken. It was inedible. It had no flavor and there was something off with the meat, like a bad after taste. We left unsatisfied and rarely do I ever feel unsatisfied from a buffet in Vegas, because at the end, the dessert bar makes up for it. Unfortunately, their dessert bar was sad as well. Boooooo.What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with. 

There was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.Had a bug in my sake and they did not even care! Saryah was our waitress and although attentive not friendly nor apologetic about the visitor in my drink.... will I go back probably not....2 stars cause the food was good...too bad the service was NOTLet me just say the signage and reservation paperwork is deceiving. You think you starting at the Flamingo, but no its that itty bitty sign near the Flamingo taxi pick up. Then you have dishonest employees that steal your clothing. Two dresses vanished and nobody has a clue.Slow service, it's not efficient, food not amazing. Ain't nobody got time for that! Need to clean there chairsIf you're looking to quickly get in and get out buffet...this is not the place. We have waited almost 1 hour and 30 minutes (on a Monday!). Quite ridiculous. There is 40-50 people in line at a time with only 1-2 cashiers. Staff is not the friendliest and you have to find the manager if you want to make a complaint. They say, "you have to find a worker with a walkie talkie to grab the manager". All in all, even if we can on a groupon deal, we won't be back. Very disappointed in the line system. Not to mention the unapologetic management.The manager in the restaurant speak nothing to us and then no smile ,  the food is ok ,the restaurant is clean but a very bad service ,I can't understand how can u open a restaurant like that and say nothing to your costumerTerrible do not eat here.  For starters the service sucked.  Our waiter came once then disappeared.  After a while another woman took care of us and was kind (the only high point of the experience).  The food advertised on the menu is not what we got. A thick cut slab of bacon was two tiny bits of bacon (for 6 bucks).  The French toast was inedible. When we asked for a manager he was very rude, demeaning and certainly didn't care what we had to say.  I've never had someone so rude at a restaurant and believe me my boyfriend and I were not rude first or demanding anything crazy.  Stay away!  Eat at the creperie down the way and split.As a fellow CheeseSteak Lover, I have to try it when I see it on the menu.

Not a fan here.  First, if you want me to come back, Why do you nickel and dime me as a customer?  That's just bad business.  $15 for my meal?  It's fast food!

Anyway, I'll sum it up...  No thanks.Hello, its called the Pink Taco! Guaranteed to be just a name and not meant for any means of food quality. Hello....anyone getting this pink taco! Not tasty, no, no, no. It would be better if they served sausages and named it slippery dicks!Cheesecake. 


Meh. Looks MUCH better than it tastes! It actually tastes like the plastic container it came in, needless to say it has NO flavor. What a disappointment! I wish I would have kept walking past the glass display case the cheesecakes were in because this cheesecake was not worth the $10 price tag. I would NOT recommend this place based on my cheesecake. I mean, how can you go wrong with this?? Booooo.We heard they played HipHop on Sundays, so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in Vegas. 

Upon walking up, the "pubber" guys didn't even give me any of the "girls get in free" wristbands (the first place NOT to). Now I consider myself a damn hott female, so i dunno what his excuse was.  Needless to say,  we stand in a hodge-podge of a line. It was total chaos. Of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to "let" in. 
My boyfriend and I stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins. The bouncer wld choose ppl behind us, next to us...but not us. It wasn't long before I realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in & had no plans to anytime soon (unless we tipped him big like others did). 

I also began to think he wasnt letting us in b/c we were black....it's 2011 dude. Get over urself. 

After about 45min we left. It wasn't worth it to me to endure that crap......AND they weren't even playing hiphop #FAiLTheir main goal is to rip you off. They say things like, "if you know anything about cars, you KNOW you've gotta do (insert extra crap here)". I will never go there again; the way they relay their information is like talking to a sleazy salesman.Unless you're below the age of 10 (or are traveling with kids), you will not enjoy the Adventuredome.

It is a waste of time and money.DO NOT GO!!!!  i was involved in an accident there two days ago.  the ride i was on broke in half and came to a violent and sudden stop.  there was 13 people on the ride, most of them small children.  the staff had no idea what to do.  no medical units were sent to check the children or adults.  we were given an attitude when we asked for our money back.  i was then contacted yesterday and they refused to give me any information about the cause of the accident.  i will never go there again, and i will tell everyone that asks about it the same thing!!Terrible experience. Rude staff. Will never again frequent this hotel or anything to do with this hotel. Just tried to go on a simple ride. If you like employees waving their hands in your face as you're taking a picture or showing no concern for you as a customer, then this is the place to go.The General Manager of Krave is an absolute liar, i NEVER hit anyone, nor would i ever do that. It's outrageous for him to post such a defamatory comment.

It was my friend who i admitted in the original review, that hit the girl after she hit him and pushed him.

The General Manager doesn't know a thing, because he wasn't there to witness it nor would he listen to me or my boyfriend tell him what had actually happened. It's appalling to see the General Manager act in such a horrific manner, lying, accusing, and posting information that is just false.i'd give it zero stars if i could but here's why we (yes, all four girls) hated this restaurant.

1) we had breakfast here, not late night food (when the choices are much more limited) so in theory, we CHOSE to eat here out of convenience since we were staying at the signature.

2) we ate at bouchon restaurant (venetian) the morning before, and had incredible - and i mean INCREDIBLE, 5 star worthy breakfast there for the SAME price.

3) the service SUCKED.

4) the COFFEE was the WORST. $3.50 for coffee (they ask you if you want coffee like it's free but it's NOT. I found out after I ordered by looking closely at the menu...if I knew, I would have spent less than that at starbucks for better coffee). They bring you a carafe that I'm assuming can be shared by multiple people because it's refillable but who wants a refill of burnt sand? Not me. I thought they'd charge $3.50 per carafe but no, they charge per mug. We ended up paying $7.00 for coffee that was so disgusting we had to ask for a pitcher of HOT WATER to dilute it and the waitress asked, "Oh, is it for the coffee?" Uh... wow. she KNEW. I bet sooo many other people asked for water to dilute their horrible coffee. I can tell you this much. that nasty coffee was the last thing i consumed in Vegas and it woke the hell out of me. I guess it did its job in a fraction of the usual sips I need (too bad i drink coffee for the taste and not so much for the kick start).

If you are going to eat breakfast, please people. go to bouchon. you won't regret it. get the sausage there. it's sooooo soft and delicious. the french toast is like bread pudding and the ham/cheese/egg sandwich is killer. the mimosa is bomb, too. since i can't give this place zero stars, might as well recommend a better choice (so my job is done).

for late night eatery, i guess you have no choice but to come here. stay away from the coffee.

(for a visual representation of the horrible coffee, I uploaded a pic on my profile page - I'm not mean enough to post it here).This buffet is terrible and terribly expensive. Unless you're just into mass consumption and just want to gorge yourself on the food, you can't get the worth of the meal out of it.  Go to the Bellagio, go to Ceasers, go anywhere but here.  The selection is terrible....

Oh and make sure you don't eat here shortly before going to the airport to catch your red eye.  Disaster will be waiting for you.first off the line to get in here was redic.  LIKE ABSOLUTELY REDIC. full of like very overweight people, old people, families, whatever. (sorry is that too much??) 

our server was SO NICE and he was the happiest guy!  we really liked him! 

the problem was in the kitchen.  my friend ordered an omelet with no cheese, and i ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich.  (easily veganizable, which i liked!) 
first off - the mushroom sandwich came out like 10 mins before the omelet which is always a peeve.  come on send stuff out together, even taco bell sends out a complete order - piecemeal makes everything uncomfortable. 
THEN my friend finally gets the omelet - and its full of cheese.  she has to send it back as she is lactose intolerant.  about 15 mins later (note: i have completely finished MY sandwich at this point) she gets a new omelet - IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT.  LIKE A HUGE BLACK HAIR.  we were DYING.  but she was also starving.  she sent the omelet back.  third time was a charm and it came out with no cheese, no hair, and looked ok (*fingers crossed LOL)  but we were surprised that after sending it back twice and waiting over an hour to get her omelet that it wasn't comped.  

Vegas should be about customer service, its a vacation!  why do these restaurants forget the main rule - its about service.  

i will never go back there. 

Vegan pro tip: they have soy milk available for coffee.mediocre food at best and too overpriced for the lack of quality.  although my pulled pork sandwich was ok, 3 of my friends had to send their plates back because they were cold.  one of the steaks was completely undercooked.   i'm not a picky eater, but what i did notice about my experience was the ultimate lack of customer service on behalf of our waitress "kitty".  she just could not be bothered with the table and that is what ultimately set the tone for the experience.  she could have definitely made my score maybe one star higher, but the manager's offer of "a free desert", did not make things any better.  overall, i would never recommend this place to anyone even staying at the hotel! phoenix has far too many amazing restaurants in the same price range than to settle for this place.For a restaurant at a resort, this place was a disappointment. Customer service should ALWAYS BE NUMBER ONE....Service was not very good. I even think that we were bothering the waitress because she would not acknowledge us. So I got the attention of another waiter who ended up being our waiter....

For the meal, I don't think Arizona knows how to make a fish taco....they should ask So-Cal....IMHO....You never put iceberg lettuce in it....just crappy, especially for the price! $4 a fish taco....

The one star is for the peach tea....It was very good....

Sorry Hole-in-the-Wall, you need to work on your restaurant skills....Now I would have given no stars if they gave the option. Now where do I start... I had my bachelorette party here and it was by far the worst place I have ever made reservatins with. Thier Mgr, Robin, Took $250 to book private VIP service for my party. We arrived and we were told by security that they had no reservation for us. Needess to say, ms. Robin was off and failed to tell anyone about our reservation. I spoke to the mgr on duty and after having to yell at the guy, we were taken all the way to a back corner where he had towipe dirty tables just so we could have a place to sit(we were promised up front by the dance floor) Then it takes 30 mins to get our designated server and she complained about having to serve us the entire time. To end the night, a stupid female security offcer kept yelling at us to "Get the F out or she would hurt people" 30 minutes before closing. Of course they were ok with adding over $100 gratuity for themselves. After our horrible night, we called that robin chick and she made promises to us she still hasnt followed through.... So if your planning a special event at this location, DONT!!! Don't let them ruin it as nobody in that building gives a crap about you or your money!My husband and I showed up for an early dinner late lunch.  Prices seemed reasonable & there wasn't but a few other people in the restaurant. We order our meals: 1/2 a rack of Baby back ribs with fries and "fresh steamed" vegetables for him, and the Gilley's chopped salad with chicken for me. My husband also orders a beer. The waitress brings the beer after 3 or so minutes, he asks for a glass and she just leaves. A few minutes later she comes with the glass almost pissed he asked for it!  When our meals come out, his 1/2 rack are dry & looks like it came from a pot bellied pig, his fries are COLD and his vegetables are soggy. My salad is drenched in dressing, lettuce is soggy, chicken is dry and it's just a mess.  To top all of this off, our waitress continued to be very curt and short with us and our bill was $45! 
We just paid our bill and got the hell outta there. This town is too big with too many other restaurants with people who enjoy their jobs.  Kinda sad, we were hopeful for this place.Nothing was good here. My wife got beef and broccoli, the beef was NASTY. I got a spicy chicken dish, again, nasty. The prices are high, the food stinks... Screw this place.Went in thinking it was the usual Pei Wei, big mistake. The food was close but no cigar. Not sure what they were thinking...I just left hash house a go go and I will never go back.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken had no flavor except for the maple syrup poured all over it.  Sweet sticky meat with beading that tasted like fried white flour.  The waffles had bacon inside, again dessert meat. I ordered a side of sausage gravy to try to salvage the chicken, I ate about a teaspoon, it was the consistency of thick pudding. Again thick flour taste with a bit of sausage mixed in.  So needless to say I wasn't crazy about the food.  However my real problem was the service.  Kelly was my waitress, and while not exactly rude, not very helpful when she realized I had a problem.  I told her I needed the gravy because I wasn't crazy about the syrupy chicken, she said " yeah, some people don't like the sweet meat, I guess you learned!". When I didn't eat much even after she brought the gravy she said, "is it making you sick?, I'll get it out of your way".  I didn't ask for a free meal, and I was not comfortable saying more because of her comments.  But the thing is, that she offered no options to rectify the situation, she did not send a manager over to talk to us, and charged us for everything.  Really disappointing experience.Bad food and bad service. $22 for some funky kalbi chicken. Overpriced menu. BTW, if you bring in a groupon, they expect you to order 1 dish per person dinning. Cheapest item on the menu is $10( I believe it's chow mein noodles). 

Save yourself the trouble with the groupon and just go to the Greenland market food court. Better food and better prices.If I could give this place a 0 I would. Horrible (read NO) service, overpriced and just a bad experience. 

We stat at at table at the end of the bar, no one ever came to the table while we were there for an hour. We stood at the self service station at the end of the bar for 15 minutes. One beer and 3 cocktails (nothing out of the ordinary) was $50. The bartender was an arrogant ass. 

Lots of other options in Vegas...skip this bar.So disappointed.  This used to be one of our favorite restaurants.  We made reservations on wednesday november 9 2011 to celebrate a new job I had just begun, and were so excited.  We wanted to take things slow, and ordered wine and apps.  When our Bruschetta came, my boyfriend and I each took a piece.  All of the sudden he looked in pain, and started touching his face.  He reached into his mouth, and started pulling out LARGE CHUNKS OF PLASTIC!    There were big pieces of plastic mixed inside of our appetizer!   He bit into it and broke the plastic into bits, and luckily wasn't seriously injured.  It was disgusting and disturbing.  It looked like pieces of a plastic spoon.  However, we wanted to be nice and calm and enjoy our evening, so we showed the bits of plastic my boyfriend had PULLED FROM HIS MOUTH to the waiter, and politely asked for our food to be removed.
Now I understand mistakes happen in the food industry.  I worked in it for years.  What I can't understand, is why after your customer BITES INTO PLASTIC SPOONS THAT ARE INSIDE THEIR BRUSCHETTA the waiter does not alert a manager or comp anything off the tab.  Our waiter said " oh well these things happen" as he cleared the bruschetta with the plastic spoon crushed inside from our plate and asked us if we wanted more wine.  WHICH HE CHARGED US FOR.  And then when we didn't order entrees because we were grossed out by the fact that our food had chances of plastic in it, our waiter made us feel bad and rushed us put.  
So we paid 60 dollars for 3 glasses of wine ( one which we only ordered because our waiter made it sound like it would be comped due to the PLASTIC IN OUR FOOD and an appetizer that was full of LARGE CHUNKS OF PLASTIC.
Olive and Ivy used to be one of my favorite places to eT, and a sentimental favorite for my boyfriend and me.  We spent many special occasions eating there, and always knew we could rely on it.  Much has changed.  The way we were treated last night was unacceptable. I regret that we were too kind and understanding. I would like to say next time we will get a manager involved, but there will be no next time.  And believe me, we will tell all our friends this storyReally?  Anyone who gives this place more then 2-3 stars literally has no taste buds.  We came here for dinner...$30.  I was expecting at least decent food and this was no where near decent.  The crab legs were grey...not bright orange/red like they are supposed to be, dull, smelled so fishy and tasted horrible.  I tried as much as I could, here was everything that was disgusting...

Mashed potatoes - Fake, potato flakes, blah.
Meatballs
All the chinese food - cold, could tell it was sitting out there forever!
Salad - No dressings were labeled, the toppings were things you would see at Sizzler, but worse.
Broccoli - Cold and no flavor
Pasta bar - watery sauce, no flavor
Braised short ribs - MSG all day
Ice cream - Non fat frozen yogurt, disgusting
All other desert - Tasted like it came from a factory

The only decent thing was the prime rib and the fact that you get wine at no extra charge, that is the only reason it get's 1 star.

Not worth the money and not worth the stomach ache later.seriously even if I'm not Zagat, I have at the very least travelled to many parts of the world and have sampled many authentic foods from different countries.  Italy being one of my favorite countries, and food.   Ceasars Palace Rao's is in my opinion a total rip off, in pricing and quality of food comparatively speaking.  When you pay 27 dollars for a spaghetti plate I expect something rather good, if not the best.  The spaghetti we got was no better than chili's or spaghetti warehouse type but they only charge 10 dollars.  Serious, I ordered Osso Buco, and it was 47 dollars, believe me, it was the worst i've had.  The buffets in vegas had better Osso Buco, the texture was bad, and had little to no taste to it.  considering the cost of this meal, come on Ceasars Palace you can do better.  Learn from Wynn, and learn from Ballagio.  The manager was nice to offer a comp desert and coffee, but seriously they should have done better, just for customer service.  I'm definitely not dining at any of the Ceasars group chains again, value is the name of the game to customer loyalty, you can't charge high prices just because, provide something decent in return.  total disappointment.The service was bad!!! My husband and I were seated by the host and that was the last of it. No one greeted us or offered us anything. We left after 5 minutes and informed the two gentlemen at the host station. The man asked which table we were seated at and that was the end of the conversation. No apology or nothing. However, great valet service...he was the only one gracious enough to apologize for the lack of service.So disappointed. This place is a robbery at gun point. Me and my boyfriend go out to eat once a week and we decided to choose this place for our New Years afternoon meal. First off, I should have taken warning to a Mexican food place with the name pub in it. The salsa tasted like bad pizza sauce. The decor is pathetic. And then the tamale I ordered was HORRID. I took 2 bites of it and couldn't believe how bad it was. I took it home and ended up giving it to a homeless person and felt bad he had to eat it. I can not figure out how this place has stayed in business and has 2 other locations. Once the check came the waitress rang up my order as a #4 instead of #14 which cost me $3 more. I was so over being there I just paid and left. I will never return here or recommend it.I put in a phone order for mild and chili line wings and got a box of mild and plain wings. Thanks for ruining my craving.Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. 

Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. 

Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. 

I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: "The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the "FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT"

If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.THIS REVIEW IS FOR CABELA'S RESTAURANT
I ate here twice. Twice it was very bad cafeteria food. Bummer.

You are better off hitting one of the surrounding restaurants. Lots of OK ones to choose from.This was the worst dim sum ive ever had! Went there for lunch atound 1 pm there food wasnt warm because the lady asked us if we wanted it heated up. We should have just walked out then. There was a hair on the soy sauce container too. Lost our appetite after that. Grocery store dim sum would have been better.So I was coming here once a month or so maybe more, however after Happy Hour Disaster I will not be back.  I went to Happy Hour and asked if they could do a veggie taco instead of a meat one.  They seriously delivered a tortilla with peppers in it.  Thats it! No cheese, salsa, sour cream just some sorry peppers.  Then boy wonder manager starts telling me the about the bulk price of meat.  Really Timberlake knock off you think I care?  If you dont do veggie taco then dont do them.  Maybe a mea culpa would be, we dont do veggie tacos but let me take 2 bucks off the potato tacos we actually make.  Say goodbye to my 140 dollars a month, too bad because I like your food. I always recommend Agave to hungry rock climbers as it is close to Red Rock, but no more.WORST resturant i went on my whole trip!!!!!!!!! Poor customer service, after having an appetizer my roll never came and I had to tell my waitress who told me I should have reminded her my roll never came...the roll it looked all dried out and dull, and it had this really awful smell. Kind of like when you use way too much detergent in washing your tupperware, put your food in the tupperware, and then your food ends up smelling like a mix of plastic tupperware and detergent. The waitress was a hostile listener. She never came to check on us. Every time we asked her for something she totally looked frustrated.

This place is a pass. I will never, never return.I can't speak for their cooked menu but the sushi is a disgrace here. I tried the most expensive roll - Las Vegas Roll for $18. It had no Nigiri and was full of imitation crab meat and what tasted like canned tuna.  My only mistake was finishing the roll instead of sending it back and walking away.  Manager offered no refund after I complained.  

I'm literally astonished that they present this as upscale Sushi.There really was nothing redeeming about the entire time spent here...  The dinner started with me politely asking if we could have a table that was on the opposite side from the casino so I could avoid smoke (I was getting over the flu and the restaurant was EMPTY), so she proceeds to seat me at a table right by the railing.. ummm thanks. 

Moving on.. We decided to try the $12.99 special with included soup/salad, "steak", potato, fried shrimp, and pie. Stupid stupid stupid!

Waitress was slow, food took forever (again I remind you the place was empty). Chicken noodle soup was gross.. all celery and onions. The steak.. oh wow, I've never seen a more nasty piece of meat in my life, but ok that's to be expected. Moving on to the potato.. can you please cook it for more than 30 seconds so it's not cold and hard as a rock? Please?

Pie.. icey cold and basically just packaged gooey nasty pie. 

Bad service, bad food... don't waste your time. The food court is great.. and if you're in need of breakfast the service and food at Original Pancake House is great.You want to know why locals always make fun of these idiot casino executives? Take a look at this place, it was a kitschy rotating bar famous for almost 5 decades and a fun spot for people to live out Fear and Loathing in LV moments or just experience one of the few things in this town that was authentic to "the old days". Another plus for the casino is it was a draw for the non "bargin hunters" and general jackassery normally found in the Circus Circus. Instead the bone they promoted to some post wanted to make his mark by callously tearing the bar out for an uberlame snack/ice cream thing. Now if you want to say its about the bottom line and the current incarnation makes more, fine but id say your wrong but fine. There's still plenty of real estate to put a crappy snack thing and still keep a bar. Anyhow Im super annoyed so I'll stop now.First, the place was dead. As in not a soul in sight other than some burnout sitting at the bar. 

Secondly, our waitress was a complete and utter jerk and that's as lightly as I can put it.

Thirdly, put a door handle on the front door so people don't stand there trying to figure out how to get in the bar you dimwits.They basically STOLE my ticket back from me! My husband and I were flying my folks out to Phoenix to babysit our kids for a few days. We bought them each a round trip ticket from LA to Phoenix. A day later we realized we needed them here a day earlier than planned, and of course understood there'd be a $150 change fee per ticket. So, I kept the ticket as it was and purchased a new, additional one-way ticket for just my mom so she could get here early and then my stepdad would fly out a day later on the original ticket. All was good until it was time to check them in for their return flight back to LA. My mom's original return flight wasn't coming up on the computer. I called US Airways and they said since she didn't travel on her original flight out, that she unknowingly forfeited her return flight as well. After utter shock and anger, they made me buy another last minute, full-priced ticket to get her home today. So to sum it up they received twice the money from us, and then received money from another passenger for using my mom's original seat. Does this sound unreasonable to anyone else? There's no reason they couldn't have just put her on that plane this morning without charging us yet again. I'm disgusted with this airline and will avoid them as well as American, for any future flights.I'm not from around here. That being said, I wish I would have asked a local where to grab a quick lunch. Instead I was starving and only had 30 minutes for lunch, so I stopped at the first place I saw: this place and Arby's. I shoulda went for Arby's...but I'm a sucker for local businesses. At least my perception of a local business. I don't know if this place is. 
Anyway, I ordered the yakisoba with shrimp. It. Was. Disgusting. It tasted old. I don't care how many chunky veggies are in the dish, the broccoli was starting to yellow, a sure sign that it was not fresh. The shrimp were medium sized but I think I counted 5. Maybe 6? As for the noodles themselves, reheated ramen is my guess. With some pathetic, diluted soy sauce mixture pooled at the bottom. So gross. Worst $11 I ever spent. Since it was a to go order, I was not in a position to send it back. Instead I picked at the carrots and shrimp but had to throw the rest away. So nasty.It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.

I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  

NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  
Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.

Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.

I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.


EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.Have been here for take-out lunch several times before and all was good. Service was quick and food was good.  Not today though.  Came in around 12:20PM and one of the four waitresses noticed me standing near the "Wait to be seated sign" (she was near the bar). She said "Hi" and then disappeared.  So I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and waited. After 5-6 minutes of waiting, none of the 4 waitresses came over and asked me if I wanted to be seated, or if I wanted take-out or anything.  No one said a word to me and no one came over. So then I started to feel like an idiot just standing there, and so I left and went down the street to Spicy Tuna. Spicy Tuna was busier than SushiWa, but they took my order almost immediately as I walked in.  So sad SushiWa!Just about the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the drinks. I had a sip of just about everyone's drink, and they were all pretty tasty.

I dined with Emily E. (below, in the party of 12), and I agree with everything she said.

While the food wasn't bad, it was not worth the price -- $65 for my husband and me. I have no problem paying for quality, but Havana Grill simply wasn't worth it.

The waiter was downright rude at times. I felt he didn't put much effort into service because he knew he was getting 18 percent gratuity (not what I would have left by any means had I the choice).

I am sad there aren't many Cuban restaurants in town, as I long for the authentic fare I ate in Miami two years ago. Looks like we locals just won't get the chance to experience something better.I ate here for the first, and last, time tonight. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered, but it was steak with caramelized onions on smashed bread. It was dry, dry, dry. The onions were about half cooked, certainly not caramelized. The steak, besides being dry, had no flavor. I guess the best thing I had was a few french  fries. Two people in our party arrived late, placed their orders, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone brought the bill. All of the orders, even the late ones were on there, along with the tip, but still the food hadn't arrived. They had to ask for it again. It was never even made.Alright from the outside this place looks like it may be worth visiting and once you get inside it looks like a huge club.  But as I worked my way to the back of the club tho Gasp! I've been BAMBOOZLED!!! A mirror wall! I kept getting that same feeling the rest of the night. The more and more time I spent inside  the less and less I liked it.  From the $10 cover charge ($8 for the ladies), really for a club like this? To the excessive amounts of pork swords present that night.  There were absolutely no attractive women, lots of old folks, too many guys, there was a couple of waitresses that were decent but that's it.  Dance floor is big and super crowed.  I'm trying to think of a way to describe the interior décor in this place hmmm... what to say... how do I put this... This place is ghetto, there I said it. Standard $8 mixed drinks, if going to run this type of club at least have some drink specials or something.  The waiters were standoffish and uninterested, with the exception of a white bartender with glasses (I think he said his name was Kevin maybe???) who was very helpful, friendly, and did a great job staying on top of people's drinks, he even gave me a FREE BEER for waiting and I hardly waited at all:). You know what would make this place better? is a pirate theme:).  The staff could wear eye patches and fake parrots with those big striped black and white stocking that would be hot.  With a big fat bald door man wearing jail strips guarding the door, it would be great. I don't get why this club has vip sections, they should just have extra seating. The only thing this place has going for it is it's somewhat big, and it has Kevin (Or whatever his name is).  I would like to see clubs in Scottsdale hire more bartenders like the fellow mentioned above instead of the sweat band wearing, immaculately quaffed, Kingdom Hearts hair do, frat boys you see over there.  I even prefer Kevin over the uncaring, inattentive bartending bimbos of Westgate. 

Hurricane Bay is a great name for this place because it looks like Katrina rolled through and left it a disaster!:)Snap!I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a "dollar" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. 

So we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. 

As for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. 

Treating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.I wanted to go because they advertise over 77 beers on tap...but not this past Friday.  The first three beers I asked for were not available.  Number four was a dog head fish IPA which they finally did have.  The terrible service on a Friday night rates less than 1 star.  This is a great example of commercial industry ruining a great concept, the pub.  Please stick to your Ultra clubs and E TV clients, thanks!Two months, I sent them a cancellation fee, and they are still harassing me, charging me monthly fees. Now they are threatening me, saying, "If you keep ignoring us, this will affect your ability to obtain financing in the future." Yeah. OK. Uh-huh.

I am at a point where I am about to file a lawsuit. 

They have caller ID on their systems. I didn't give anyone my name, yet the billing department gave me to a manager who picked up and said, "Hello Atoosa." How the hell did you know it was me? I never gave a name.

Patty said she would call me as soon as she received my documents. She never did. It's been ten days. I know it's been ten days because I have the dated, signed, return receipt from the postal office.

Read these links. These are not just one or two people. They do this to everyone. I have never come across a business this shady in all my life!

http://www.consumeraffairs.com/health_clubs/las_vegas_athletic_clubs.htmlHorrible horrible horrible everything!! Gaming sucks! Bartenders suck!! Food sucks!! The only reason for possibly a 1 star was because of a sweet server that walked by and said helloI usually do not leave bad reviews, but this time I feel it's needed. I have been here two times now and the service is just bad. The first time I walked out after never being seated or even acknowledged.  I thought I would give it one last try a few nights ago and went back for dinner with my girlfriend. No one acknowledged we were even there, we waited for about 15 minutes and finally sat ourselves. After 10 more minutes of sitting and being ignored as waitresses walked around us, we finally got up and left. I would like to comment on the food, but since we were never served I can't. This place really needs new management...It is so bad that I have to sign up Yelp so I can tell people not to waste their money.  I ordered two take out dishes: Thai Dynamite chicken and Korean spicy beef.  My verdict: a notch better than Panda, but cost the as much.  I am Asian.  My opinion of Pei Wei: go there if you like American Asian food.  If you like something a bit more authentic, go to Asian Grill on Alma School and Riggs, only 5 mins away from Pei Wei.  Cheaper too. Mind you, the restaurant is not good looking like Pei Wei.They need to change their name from "Fry's" to "Indoor Garage Sale".  Do they actually sell new items here??? Couldn't find any!

Needed a USB cable. All 3 of them on the shelf had been previously opened and scotch taped closed by either Michael J. Fox or Ray Charles!

Never again!!!came here today with my husband and daughter. we waied for 45 mins and got literally 5 feet. 

it was 230 pm and there couldnt have been more than 30 people in line. thats ridiculous. there were tons of empty tables too! 

we can be hungry and wait but with a one year old, um i dont think do. peace out!SMALL, sticky, hot, 2 tiny kiddy pools, OVER-priced 50 girls to 1 guy. Not my thing at all.I was only here briefly, but after seeing how one of the employees was totally dressed down by her boss, in front of a customer, I don't think I'll be shopping here.I was so excited to go to a restaurant that had advertised European food with "live" entertainment. My family arrived at the restaurant at 6 pm on a Saturday night.. We ordered our dinners including Hungarian Goulash. The waitress stated that the kitchen was closing and they didn't have time to make the Hungarian Goulash. Really?????? You are closing the kitchen at 6:15pm on a Saturday night? Well, they didn't have the ingredients to make the Goulash. 10 people came in after us and ordered meals. Humm..... 
The beef stroganoff tasted like the Costco special and the "live" entertainment was a 1 man band. He actually did a great job. I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone.CONSUMER BEWARE IS RIGHT!!!  I called to set up basic  cable & internet service. I was given a bundle price of which I agreed to and was a fair price. I then upgraded my cable and got a couple of new boxes. I was told at that time of my new monthly fee which was stretching my budget but I wanted the extra channels. a few weeks later I check my bill and it had gone up $40!!!! Apparently my original internet pricing was a promotional pricing and was never told. So now Cox thinks they can just increase my bill and not tell me!!!! Not even a letter or an e-mail of the new adjustment. It took me 3 reps to get to a supervisor. I guess now I have to downgrade my nternet and my cable... Just be careful of Cox!I am surprised that they have good reviews. 
I would say this was my least favorite chinese restuarant in town. 
I am trying to think postiviely after reading some of 5 star reviews, but 
I cannot forget how orange chiken tasted like a sugar chiken. 
I almost thought I was eating a dessert. 

I don't mind modern, dark, quiet atmosphere as long as the chinese food tastes like chinese food.Nothing has gotten better here... Let me tell you I have NEVER had a complaint on me and I am rarley home. Well. my neighbors are upstairs and at 1 AM last night I called security because, they're noise level is out of this world and it scares my little one. I have made the office aware of this on several occasions... Well, today the office man Josh told me that the neighbor called complaining that I am noisey (keep in mind that I have never have a complaint and am never home) and told them my husbands alarm clock wakes him up. MY HUSBAND IS HEARING DISABLED. The nerve on these people!! And my "dog is loud and scratches all day" I DONT HAVE A DOG!!!!!!! And, Josh said he is taking the neighbors complaint seriously! I have been complaining for months. i understand they have a kid but, so do I and she gets woken up and is scared of the banging! I would be happy if they transfered us... But, they want to charge us a 250.00 transfer fee and RAISE OUR RENT ALMOST 200.00 FOR THE SAME FLOOR PLAN!!!! If we went to a one bedroom it'd be 78.00$ more...  HOW unfair is that?! I understand apartment living I really do! But, midnight till six am is just tottaly un fair for us. I understand they have a kid but, so do we and we get up early. I cant hear my neighbor next door with three kids! They say were noisey? Every neighbor we have says they dont hear us and they always ask if weve been gone awhile! JOSH ALSO ASKED ME TO HAVE MY NEIGHBORS COME TO THE OFFICE TO VOUCH FOR ME. I find that so unprofessional!!!! Why bring them into this? Why even go that far? Why not transfer us and do the right thing and make us happy. I hope they let us out of our lease... I pay way to much here to be treated like this and go through this stuff. I am RESPECTFUL and if i am home... I am quiet and mostly sleep. How is it I can complain for months and the neighbor says one thing back about me and its taken seriously? Also, I dont want problems its frustrating when my baby screams and can't sleep at night... But Josh keeps telling the neighbor what I say and tells me what he says and that DOES not help at all.... I am sick of this!!!El Encanto (Cave Creek) and El Encanto Dos (Carefree Hwy) are not owned by the same folks as  the original El Encanto restaurant located in Cave Creek  and nor is the food nearly as good as.  The food at El Encanto Dos is over rated!  In the past month or so the portions have dwindled to the point that when I order the steak fajitas, I think of vegetable fajitas with a touch of  tough steak.  The flour tortillas are so hard and dry they might as well be made of cardboard. Not worth the drive!!  An experience you can live without!!!Cox is a business that truly lives up to its name.  And, no, that's not a good thing.

Their "preferred" internet speeds are slower than standard services that other companies offer, their link to register for an account to pay online is broken, and when you call-in to pay a bill via the automated system, you get disconnected (even on a Sunday morning) due to "high call volume."  

Even further, I was told that I would get a free installation, and instead they sent me a self-installation kit and had the nerve to charge me for it!  It is without reservation that I affirm that Cox sucks.Terrible Experience! They threw away my $200 vacuum!  The store manager here has absolutely no integrity and customer service is not a factor!  I took my vacuum in and left it for service.  I received a call from the vacuum service department and the man told me it was $24 dollars to service the vacuum.  I agreed and the vacuum was in perfect working order.  Under law, a verbal agreement will be binding if there was an accord on the services to be carried out and an agreement was reached on payment for this service as it was in my case.  I was unable to pick up the vacuum right away so I contacted the store.  Again, I spoke to a man in the vacuum department who assured me that it was not an issue and my vacuum would be there.  I called again two weeks ago and said I would be in soon. Again I was told it was fine.  I went in yesterday and was told that I exceeded the 30 period on the receipt and that my vacuum had been thrown away and they were not responsible.  I spoke to the manager and explained that their employee told me two times not to worry about the time delay for my pickup.  Between my last call to the store and my arrival my phone # changed.  They made their only attempt to call me during that time and since they could not reach me they threw it out.  First of all, why would anyone throw away a perfectly good vacuum when so many people are in need and there are organizations who take such items?  They chose to throw it away.  If they had donated it I would at least find some comfort in that.  The manager agreed to call me after speaking to the vacuum repair employees however no call was received.  I called them.  These people have no regard for their customers.  And the employees will only follow the manager's example.  Poor and unacceptable!I am an avid Black & White shopper, I love it! I just relocated to Scottsdale from Southern California and I have been SO disappointed with the service at the Kierland Commons location. Both my mom and I have been there several times and at first I thought it was just me, but confirming with my mom,  unfortunately we have both had the same experience. The ladies we have encountered have been so unfriendly and snobby which is so unlike the experience I have had in the past with other B&W locations. It makes me not want to shop there anymore! 
Come on ladies, it's not Chanel, please loosen up a little!Probably the worst Walmart I've been to. Do not use them for oil changes. Some kid at the register tried to rip me off 48 cents and I had to talk him through using a calculator to do subtraction because he honestly had no idea. Effin' idiot! Plus there is a lady there in a wheel chair who will most of the time stare at you and tell you to hold on, then go chat with her co-workers. I hate this place!Ever since I had my pizza thrown at my feet and change thrown to my face from the Manager of this restaurant in 2008, I have since never ordered a pizza from Domino's. 

That happen when I commented on how my friend felt uncomfortable of the way she looked at him. Then came flying pizzas and flying money, yeah fantastic experienceWe stopped in tonight for the first time and won't be back.  The waitresses are dumber than a bag of rocks.  After a few drinks one might actually call a few of them "hot" - but trust us - the gate is down, the lights are flashing, but there's just no train coming with these girls and beauty can't compensate for stupidity.  They can only hope to marry someone with money or they are forever destined to work as waitresses.  Such a paradox.

A good 45 minute wait for the wrong food and even longer for a second round of drinks.  The musical game SINGO was cool (think BINGO only with songs)  but not enough to keep us there or bring us back.  We may have thought differently and not noticed the long wait had our dumb blonde waitress (with way too much ink on her)  kept our drinks flowing, but we can only assume that pouring that 2nd or 3rd glass of wine was akin to her passing a Bar exam (pun intended.)

Trust the reviews here; this place really sucks and from what we only SAW of the food, it was mediocre at best.  Nothing that would set your tastebuds on fire.  Regular old bar food.  When you walk in you are first met with a nice woodfire pizza oven which leaves you to believe they actually might have and give their local competition a run for their money.  But it only left us guessing.  

One nice thing was the owner came by to apologize and did realize the mistake, the inept waitress and did comp our drinks - but it was just too late.  We were angry, hungry and had to get to an appointment.  Like mom always said, "Sorry is a cheap word and if you have to say you are sorry, then it's too late." 

In the same shopping center go to NYPD Pizza or around the corner go to Uncle Sams for great pizza.   They are both far better food with better service.Worst customer service ever!  Trying to redeem the check in deal was told that the special is expired and it's no good, when I just ordered $40 worth of food Togo.  The cashier was rude so was the manager..  Never coming back.Let me start by saying that this is my personal opinion - but I would never use or recommend Amerizona to anyone due to their lackluster service. My intent here is only to post facts of the events I had to go through with my Amerizona shutter purchase.  Hopefully this will help you when selecting your shutter vendor.

We wanted to purchase shutters on three windows in the home to make all the windows in the home match (there were just horizontal blinds on those three windows).  We contacted Amerizona and they sent out a sales representative. This lackluster service began with the sales representative they sent to our home.  We made it very clear that we wanted the remaining windows to match the white bi-fold shutters we had on all our other windows.  We also indicated we wanted the hinges to match the other windows, because they were a non-traditional steel-type, not painted (not white).  

The invoice listed the shutters using Amerizona codes and we confirmed with the consultant that the shutters were what we discussed.  Now I take responsibility for the fact that I did not understand the codes Amerizona utilized on the invoice and yet still signed. However, the sales consultant walked through with us the information, which included bi-folds for the large windows.

When the shutters were delivered and were partially installed I noticed that the hinges were in fact painted white and not the steel-type we had requested.  I immediately told the installer the problem and showed him my copy of the invoice. Now it is important to point out here that the builder of the shutters and installer are apparently two different organizations. The installer contracts with Amerizona or visa versa. No one could ever fully detail this arrangement with me in any of the conversations I had with Amerizona.  Since I have no knowledge of the name of the installer I will not list it here.  The installer's paperwork showed "white hinges" and he at first indicated that he did not know how to read the codes used by Amerizona on their invoice.  He contacted his manager and they said they would finish the install and come back with the correct hinges, once they verified that I was correct and in fact ordered the steel-type hinges.

As the install continued and the third shutter went up I noticed it was not a bi-fold shutter.  It did not match any of the other shutters in our home.  Again I spoke with the installer, but this time he pointed out on my invoice that this particular shutter was not listed as a bi-fold shutter.  Miraculously he could now read the codes on the Amerizona invoice!  He called his manager again and this time was instructed to stop work on the install.  He came to me and said that this third shutter he had only partially installed.  He had set it up so it wouldn't fall down, but that it was not fully installed.  He recommended we didn't open the shutters, because he had finished and had not sealed it.  He indicated that I would need to call Amerizona and discuss the next steps with them.  He then asked me for the remaining balance on the account.  I refused to provide any additional funds until the work was completed as was contracted.  He called his manager and she asked me for the payment again, which I refused.  She then asked for half of the funds as the shutters where in place.  Which in reply I explained that the installer and not even completed the install, as one shutter was not done.  She then acquiesced and indicated that they would not ask again for payment until the shutters were fully installed.

They began to remove the hinges and replace them.  The installer indicated he had finished the "non bi-fold" shutter.  However when I went and looked at it he only sealed the bottom, left and right sides - not the top.  So I waited for them to finish the hinges on the other shutters. I wanted at this point to make sure I would get my hinges I was paying for from Amerizona.  

That was when the installer's drill battery died.  He had no backup and not even a Philips screwdriver to finish the work.  I had to provide the installer with my own drill set and a screwdriver for his assistant - so that they could finish the shutter work.  

This is not the way to conduct business and I stress that I would not recommend this group of companies to anyone seeking to have an easy and professional service experience.  To ensure any customers thinking of utilizing Amerizona have this knowledge prior to their making a decision of shutter service vendors I am posting this to this site.  A more detailed explanation is on the BBB review site.  This site limits the character count.Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review.  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good. (Not the best, but good). 
This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item. Machaca breakfast burrito with potato.  I've had this many times in the past but OMG!  I could not even finish it.  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it.  How do you call it breakfast without an egg?   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it.  (Yes burger. Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla.  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are.  Er... Used to be.  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest.  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste.  (How do you mess up a taco?)
 I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon 
Beware, this place may be on the way out.Terrible.  I will not go back.  Received four different stories as to where my children could or couldn't be.  Security came to us when our kids were sitting well outside the casino area (in a restaurant seating area) and told us to leave.  Not worth it.  Won't go back even without the kids.  On top of the problems with the staff, the atmosphere was horrible.   Smoky and outright boring.  Good thing I'm heading to Las Vegas where they actually have places for your kids to play and it's exciting.I took my daughter in on 11/4/11 for an eye exam, and we ordered her glasses.   They were nice, and we had no complaints about the office visit.  We were promised a delivery date of 11/13/11, which is also printed on the receipt.  
    We heard nothing, so my daughter called on 11/19, thinking perhaps they just forgot to call to let her know they'd arrive, and spoke with a lady named Joy, who stated she would get back to her.
    TWO DAYS LATER, someone else called back (on 11/21) who spoke so quickly and unintelligably that we cannot catch her name, stating that the glasses had been shipped on 11/19 and would be in the store *quote* :   "tomorrow, Wednesday, or sometime this week".   Fantastic!  Impressive.
   My daughter called again today, and they are not there.  My daughter is nearly eighteen, a college student and works full time... she is very capable, and likes to handle as much as she can regarding her own appointments, etc; but she has become frustrated and asked me to help.
    So, I called midday today, and spoke with the self-identified manager of this location, "Joe James" who looked for her glasses for a very long time, and then came back on the line and said he didn't know but 'maybe we should reorder them because maybe they got shipped to another location'. 
    I asked him to please call me back with two things:  
   1. A definitive answer on where my daughter's glasses are, and,
   2. What solution he would be willing to offer, if the answer isn't "They are here, come and get them."
   Hours later, he callec back and left a voicemail stating "the lab said they mighta got shipped to another store or got lost so I dont know but my suggestion is we probably need to reorder these if I dont receive them by tomorrow, just reorder them as "lab lost" give me a call and let me know what you think, talk to you later, bye"   .... which is NIETHER an answer as to where her glasses are (tracking? accountability?), NOR is it a solution that helps in any material way.  
    Reordering them, now, nineteen days later, when we don't know WHAT HAPPENED the FIRST TIME, where the break-down in their system is, or who is responsible... doesn't sound like an awesome solution to me.  
    We have already used this year's optical benefit to order these glasses... I already paid our $95 copay on them... what recourse do I have?    I googled issues others have had with Target, and this seems to be a recurring issue:  once they have your money and your benefit... you've got no leverage and they cease caring about it.$40 dollars plus tax for a oil change?? I think not. Drove less than half a mile down the road got it done 19.99 plus tax. Wont be returning and will be recommending people to stay away.I can't quite figure out how these people are doing better business than Katie use to do. I went to Katie weekly for years, because she was fabulous at what she did. 

First time I returned after she sold, the shop is completely packed. Instead of telling me that there was a ridiculous wait, I sat in the lobby for 30 minutes. Then was moved to the pedi station, where I sat for an additional 30 minutes. The girl who did my pedi was horrible. I could have done a better job myself at home. 
Then I get to the mani station. The arrogant woman doing my nails has an overblown opinion of her work. When I told her that I was a faithful client of Katie, they bad mouthed her, which is unprofessional and pathetic. 
Then after being told how much better and more attractive they were, she proceeded to give me one of the worst and over priced full sets I've ever gotten.I've tried this place 3 times because it's so close to my house. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed with their shamefully sloppy gel manicures each time. They always rush through the gel and either put the polish on way to thick or they don't give it enough time to dry between coats. Plus all the employees are rude and hateful. 

Like I said, I wish they were better because it's so close to home. Unfortunately, I'm much better off driving an extra 5 minutes to a place that does a decent job.On a whim, my son wanted us to stop by since this is "the pizza place of choice" for his school.  

In two words "IT SUCKED" 

The worst pizza I have ever had. Why won't YELP allow fo no stars?   It was dry, so thin, had no sauce and was overcooked. We like our pizza on the "rare" (whiter cheese) side not burnt with big air pillows of nothing.  This is Sardellas.

I should have swung by the grocery store and picked up a TOMBSTONE pizza or Costco to get a better pizza.  Not even on a drunk night would I go to this place.  Worse than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  If you are that hungry, go up the road to Burger King.

Even with all the coupons we had, it still wasn't worth it.  Thankfully my kid gets it for free at his school so we don't have to visit this place;  but one has to wonder if getting this pizza is a reward for him or a punishment?We recently have gone to picazzos and have eaten there many times. we purchase the salads and occasionally the pizza  and a appetizer. This time around we ordered wings, pasta and a few pizzas. we were so very much displeased in the meal as we had to throw it out when we boxed it up after not taking a bite of it. It looked like somebody threw up on the plate and served it to you. I assure you, if you can open up a can of spaghetti o's than you would be better off. The wings were terrible and no sauce, luke warm and the meatballs are frozen and not fresh with moldy hard cheese. The thai chicken pizza was a joke and for 30 bucks for something you can get for 15 somewhere else, its just a disappointment. I told the manager and he blew me off and told me to send in pictures of the meal that I was not happy about. who takes pictures of their food after ordering it and not liking it. I somehow knew he would ask me for that and sent them to him, totally busted right. well he came back and told me pretty much tough luck and don't come back. so Please take my advise and don't eat here. You can easily have a better meal at maggianos around the corner, get a steak at capital grill for the same price or other establishments near by. I promise you, you will be disappointed!Hummm. Large pepperoni pizza for $24.00. Taste was average and their large size is medium. Disappointing.If you're looking for anything from this company, stop and run the other way.  I had the misfortune of having them install solar hot water in my house.  They did everything wrong.  Such as installing the system and then asking for permits.  Then they had to come out and do it according to city code.  They made silly mistakes which any plumber would know, such as putting a drain pan under the tank.   The system works fine, I think. or maybe I hope.  They refuse to answer questions about their system because those in the office profess to know nothing about it.  They guy who does is always out of his office and leaving messages results in nothing....they simply don't answer them.
If I can't get information when I have nothing wrong with my system, how much help do you think I'll get when something does break.
These people really should'nt be in business and you'd be well off to seek services of some other more responsible company.They made an appt for me at 1:00.  When I arrived they said that it would be 45mins.  After over an hour they had still not started.  What's the point of having an appt?  Why tell me 45mins when you would not have even started over an hour later if I hadn't said  something?I needed new ink cartridges and OfficeMax sells their own brand.  If I ordered online, I get a 20% price break, so far so good.  I get the email that my order is ready, and go to the store.  I am the only customer and nobody greets me as I enter the store. Looks like a manager and associate at the customer service counter, I wait there, they ignore me. The sign at the end of the counter says, online order pickup.  I wait there 3 feet away from an associate wearing short shorts, she won't acknowledge me.  A male associate sees me and turns away from me.  I go back to the girl and the customer service counter, she sees me and turns away. 
I ask if I can pick up my online order, well can I ?

Thanks for nothing losers, you suck at service.
Have a nice day.With guests in town wanting an ice cream treat, we passed on visiting local favorites Sweet Republic and Sugar Bowl and chose this Cold Stone location instead. We arrived to two employees to handle our order of 6 desserts. The female employee spilled the chocolate sample offered down the front of the display case (and never took the five seconds it required to clean it, the entire time of our stay there). In an order that added strawberries, the frozen (not fresh) strawberries seemed to be a significant challenge, because as she attempted to mash the frozen fruit with her scooper (rather than slice them), she twice only succeeded in propelling them across the restaurant. This caused her to laugh about how she couldn't handle them. The replacement berries proved only half as challenging, only sending one into the atmosphere. She moved on to the banana, and had to be asked to include a second strawberry into the cream. The second order that included strawberries did successfully manage to keep any from escaping, but the strawberries themselves weren't so much "folded" in to the mix, as the less frozen outer layer of the fruit was just assaulted off the fruit's frozen core, leaving behind strawberry-tinged ice chunks.

Finally, It was time for them to make a simple chocolate shake with heath bar. Small. The attendant poured an excessive-but-unmeasured volume of milk into the blender, and scraped the sides of the chocolate cream tin and added it. She then moved on to another order in the back (I think she went on a quest for a cookie). This left the other clerk to take over, and he proceeded to blend the shake for well over a minute. One in my party said, "I hope you wanted chocolate milk, because that's what you're going to get."  The clerk affirmed my suspicions of this by complaining to the first, "This is way too watery."  Then, he turned and offered it to me!  "Would you like whipped cream on this?" he asked. I said, "I'm not taking this," certain that if whipped cream were added, the shake didn't have enough consistency to keep the added cream from sinking to the bottom.  

My refusal didn't elicit any apology, or an offer to start over. The first clerk did ask, "do you want me to make something else?" But her initial effort and the now-long line (at least 10 patrons deep) were enough disincentive to keep me from giving this dynamic duo another shot. My out-of-town guests said, "We'll never go to another Cold Stone." And we locals will have a story for a long time coming of our Bogus Cold Stone adventure, every time we treat our guests to Sugar Bowl or Sweet Republic.I received WORST service in this place. The manager is very rude. The employee tried to honor a promotion to us without coupon, the manager, Rob called the poor kid to the back and the employee who tried to help us, was back with tears in his eyes. I couldn't see this scenario and told him that he can't be rude, he said the employee did something wrong and he had to be dealt with. Then I said you should be nice to customers just like the employee. He said sir you are pushing it. I called their corporate, and the manager, Rob said you can't be in this building if you are filing complaint about me. I want you out or will call the cops. My children and I were very disappointed. I will never take my children to this particular chuck e cheeses............... The Ovens Are Off .............
   +++ Looks like Rosati's is looking for someone else ...... Who lacks pizza talent +++
The last Franchisee won't be missed.
Over the past 7 years this was the 3rd or 4th Failed Owner.

Serving up a decent pizza ....... isn't Rocket Science.

Here's hoping that Alton Brown ....... will be the new owner.UGH. I gave you another chance, Jason, and you served me a pasta salad with more oil than the Exxon spill. Thanks for the headache.One morning neither shower in my house would drain in less than about 10 minutes and each toilet was clogged. We called the normal plumber that our landlord uses but for some reason they directed us to Sun Devil Plumbing. We were quoted $133 for the job. I had never used a plumber before because I had always been in apartments, so I had no idea if this was a normal price or not. My roommate's boyfriend was at the house when the guy came, said he was in and out pretty fast, said something about how the guy told him it might be a good idea to get on the roof, but then said he was too lazy, or something along those lines. The boyfriend told us everything was fixed though, we got the bill for $133, thought we were good. We told the landlord about it and he said that we completely got ripped off and that was way too much to pay for that issue, but hopefully it would at least last. Here we are probably about a week later and we already have the same exact issue. So not only has every single person we have talked to, including the owner of the house, told us we were overcharged, but the job didn't even last two weeks. I've thought about calling, but it seems like if you call they are just going to defend their plumber and charge you again to come fix it. I don't really care what the reason or excuse is, as a customer there is no reason in my mind that we should have the same problem this soon after. A few months maybe, but not this soon. Needless to say I'll be calling a different plumber to fix the problem we already paid $133 for.Food is ok, but they do not deliver.Quite disappointed. It was the only one open on Mondays though. I was searching for something as good as the food in LA, but no luck. Food was cold, expensive, servings were small. What they had on the menu wasn't there such as pancit. They said they stop making it at 4:30 pm and the place closes at 8:30 pm...wow. Never again, no matter how Bad the craving. 

Any suggestions for other Filipino restaurants worth eating in Chandler???THE STENCH OF COW AND HORSE MANURE AT 110 DEGREES!  Last weekend we had a family gathering in Vegas and stayed at the South Point because we had good experiences there before.  This time they also had rodeo competition going on and they keep the animals next to their arena AND keep the doors open leading to the hotel.  Consequently, the smell of cow and horse shit in the hotel's Coronado Cafe took your breath away and it spread out through the gamming area.  Outdoors you could smell the manure at the pool and when you went out to your car in the parking garage that smell at 110 degrees almost stopped you in your tracks.  If you are planning to stay at the South Point make sure no animal events are going on.I went here for lunch and was very disappointed! I sat down and ordered a chef salad. After sitting there for 30 minutes and watching everybody who came way after me getting their food already, I was upset. Since the waitress never came back to the table, I had to ask someone else to check on my salad which should take only 10 minutes to make! Then I was told it was on its way out in about 5 minutes, Really?! So you forgot to make it and now I have to go back to work because my break is over. No one ever came over to apologize. Horrible customer service and I will not be back!Overpriced, sloppy work, rude, unfriendly & super dirty ESP in the waxing area...scary...Not recommended ~ Try another salon, you will be happy. There is a new place is moving in across the street from this establishment & I am thankful as I live close by & have to drive far for better service & quality of manicure, fills & pedicure! Not recommended!HORRIBLE! Never going back there EVER!
The place was nice, clean, pretty and all. But the service seriously blows my mind at how horrible they are. The woman who did my nails had no focus on my nails at all! She got up to chat or grab a drink at least 5-6 times just leaving me sitting there waiting. She did not listen to me at all when I was telling her how I liked my nails. And the WORST part: before she had even began I told her specifically I had a broken finger that was still healing up and to please be gentle. NOPE! She had no mercy on my finger after me telling her several times how much she was hurting it.

I had her do stilettos and they looked like shit. Then after asking her to fix the shape because I wasn't happy she told me she would at the end, which she didn't!!! Then when the HORRIBLE manicure was finished she then tells me she didn't even know how to do stiletto nails. WHAT?!?!!!! Why would you even attempt it without letting your customer know first!!!!!!! On top of all of this horror, the overall manicure was SHIT. They're all uneven!! My two pinky nails are literally completely off!

WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! NEVER GOING BACKHoly crap! This place is is SLOW! I think traveling a greater distance will be better than the stress of ever coming here again.This place is the king of lies! How can such a descriptive menu, that baits you
into ordering a bunch of food, yield results that make everything taste like semi-warm, grey matter? I ordered the "Big Al's Stuffed Sandwich" and it might as well have been a cotton ball soaked in grease. My buddy got the "Prosciutto Panini" and it tasted exactly the same, this also applies to the wife's "Cajun Chicken Sandwich" and "Stuffed Hot Peppers". It made me hate the fact that I have a mouth and no one in my party ate more than 2 bites before deciding to toss it out. The food is bad and you should feel bad!Took our son to this Snips & Clips on Grand Canyon. The black lady who cut our 14-month-old son's hair was very nice, but she did an awful job cutting it. She cut too high over the ears. Some strands were much longer than others, and the back was uneven. We will never be going to Snips & Clips again.I was a little fond of this place because when I had to do a smog check for state registration they were super friendly and called me back a few times to let me know where their emission guy was and when he was working.

However today I called them at 3:45 to see why time the close. 5:00 PM.  Great so I cruised over and got there at 4:12 PM.  First they tell me they only carry Penzoil.  Any self respecting car owner knows that Penzoil is one of the cheapest , crappiest engine oil you can buy.  So they said I could get my own oil next door at Checkers.  I said OK i'll do that.  Then the guy said "actually we are doing our last car now. We are doing a transmission on this car too, so we can't take any more cars".

WTF?  First of all you only carry Penzoil. Yuck.  Secondly you tell me you aren't taking any more cars at 48 min till close for a 10 min oil change?  Thanks for the warning!! Taking my car somewhere else for a decent oil change.My first experience with this bar has been less than stellar. I came here for lunch to grab a quick bite and food took forever. I was unimpressed by the bartenders lack of knowledge in the beers they serve. My buddy ordered a Heineken and got a Heineken light. The food was ok I had 2 sliders and fries and my buddy had 2 sliders as well just so happens another mishap my sliders come with no fries and my buddies does when he didnt order. The fact that they also do not have any beers on tap will be the main factor in me not returning again.Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!Never been more frustrated in my life. Have a diesel truck that I needed Smog on. Guy kept telling me he couldn't pass me without a Catalytic converter. I kept saying I didn't need it for my year, which is what the Dodge DEALER told me. He didn't even get under the truck or consult his part book. I went to Terribles and they did it immediately no questions asked. 

If the guy had just consulted his book and listened to what I was saying (even showed a drawing of what is factory under the truck) he would've had my business. 

Not impressed and will be going elsewhere for my smog from here on out, even though this is most convenient location for me.I'm still reeling from the even beyond poor experience. The level of customer disservice by an assistant manager named Mark is just impossible to comprehend. How this guy is allowed to abuse customers is just mind boggling. His rudeness, disrespect, and arrogance belies how Jiffy Lube could risk its brand name. I was never greeted as I walked in, just started with "what do you want'. When I said I would like the value oil change, this "asst. Mgr" Mark barked at me they won't check anything. He then yelled out to the men in the work area not to check anything, as if I was being reprimanded. It was very degrading to say the least. When the oil change was done, he didn't address me again; he simply pointed at me and motioned with his finger for me to come and pay. More disrespect. At the end of the transaction, no thank you or anything. Like he did me some great favor. My washer fluid was empty; no fill. No quality organization would ever let a customer leave with empty washer fluid. There was no attempt to offer to fill it even if there was a charge. 

$24.95 is a premium price for an oil change in Las Vegas. Most shops charge $20 or less, and are only too happy to perform checks and fluid fills graciously. Terrible's is wonderful. For $19.99 you get the works, plus a free car wash. I was originally headed there, but saw the JL had no cars inside, and seemingly decent price, which turned out to be a come on for incomplete service.  For that price, my fluids should have been topped off, tire pressure checked, etc. Basic stuff you can get with an oil change at half the price. 

Price notwithstanding, I have never been so degraded and disrespected at any retail location in my entire life. How this guy Mark could possibly be tolerated for even one day as an employee, let alone carry a manager title speaks volumes about Jiffy Lube. I've read other posts, and this guy seems to have a reputation. I wish I read some of the reviews before I went in there.  I will never, ever, go back to any Jiffy Lube location for any reason. I might add the place was empty on a Friday; usually a very busy day. I wonder how many other customers have been driven away from this miserable business by the toxic rudeness of this assistant manager. 

If you want to be treated with any modicum of decency or respect, you should steer clear of this Jiffy Lube. Sadly, I could not give this rating no stars. The only solace in this whole thing is that I now know where to never go for service.Very over priced, food isn't bad but just not worth the price. Service left something to be desired as well. Won't go back again.I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went in for an initial consultation, which I was told would cost around $80-$90 because I was a self pay.  Dr. Vanessa came in and looked at me for about 5 mins or less and then told me that I should get one mole removed because it looked suspicious and that I could have some others removed for purely cosmetic reasons if I wanted to.  I agreed to have several procedures done and pay for them all upfront.  When I went out to pay and schedule my procedures they told me that it was going to be $160 for the initial visit.  I explained that that amount was double what i was initially quoted and they did not seem to care in the slightest.  I cancelled the procedures and reluctantly paid the full amount for the BS visit.

I then called several other dermatologists in town and explained what had happened and they told me that if I came in to get checked out and they ended up needing to do a procedure that they would apply the initial fee 100% towards the cost of the procedure.  Four different dermatologists confirmed the same policy.  

When I called back to offer them to still book the procedures if they applied the $160 towards them they told me that they would not do it.

Thomas Dermatology does not value client relationships, they just want your money.  i will never go back here again, and warn anyone else to stay away.I had been to this place one time before my recent and LAST visit to this place. The first time around everything went smooth, the food was great, the service was great, no complaints. The second time around, it was a completely different experience. Let me start by saying ABSOLUTELY WORST SERVICE EVER. We walked in and the place was busy. When my boyfriend and I walked in we made eye contact with a waitress, who rather than sitting us down went about her business as if we were not there. Rude much? We get seated and we ordered our food. I ordered a small order or ceviche and my boyfriend order two empanadas and a tostada mixta. The ceviche was good, but it was missing avocado. Every other restaurant that I have gone to and ordered ceviche serves avocado with it. So I asked the waitress if I could please have some avocado. A HALF HOUR LATER I get my avocado, a whole avocado, by this time I am practically done with the ceviche!! The empanadas were fairly good, not the best. My boyfriend's tostada, wow I do not even know where to start! To begin with there was ONE shrimp on it placed neatly on the top of a mountain of haiva which is crab imitation. We dig through the pile of haiva only to find two pieces of octopus which did not look appetizing AT ALL. On the bottom of it all is what seems to be a tomato sauce. When I tell my waitress that I did not order a tostada de haiva and that I ordered a tostada mixta she simply told me that she was sorry but that it was not her fault that she did not cook that. She does not even offer to take it up to her supervisor or to return the food, NOTHING! At any other restaurant the least they do is ask if we want the food returned or replaced. Then I look for a waiter and tell him about the issue, and just like the waitress, he does nothing but explain that it is the way they make them there. Absolutely ridiculous, anyone can google a tostada mixta and you will see that nothing looks like a mountain of haiva. WORSTE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!Worst customer service ever. Waited 45 minutes with an appointment and walked out dissatisfied for the second time. Why don't i stop their service?  Because they'll charge me $700 for a phone I had for a month. I wanted to just give it back but they said that's fine it'll cost you $700.Using this management company will be anything but affordable, and there isn't much "management" either. Charged outrageous fees for clean up to make rent ready. When I inspected the property several weeks after being billed, nothing had been done. Their accounting is disorganized and full of errors. Promises were continually broken and communication ignored.Had the store manager pack and ship a package for me, and even bought insurance at his suggestion. But when the package arrived damaged, the owner gave me the run around after days of haggling on the phone.  Don't use these guys if you care about your packages.Ordered take out for our 1st time trying, wasn't given my free pound of pasta from yelp because it's dine in only (which it says no where) Waited like 5-10 inside just standing in the middle if the dining room. Then I'm handed for my single meal take out a stupid Costco box with my smaller take out box in it and the little waitress had some stupid smirk on her face like it was a joke. Just basic service and even more basic food. Definitely not worth $25 for 1 ckn parm that comes with a  "Caesar salad" oh the lettuce with 1 cruton. And a piece of wonder bread with melted cheese. Won't be trying this joint again. 1 step above Olive GardenThe worst Starbucks in LasVegas!!!!!! Drive the extra miles to get the service u deserve!!!!! Always out of everything service is the worst everPay attention to their return and exchange policy! What? You can't find it? That's because there is none! Once you bought it and had it delivered, it's yours for better or worse. Even it it broke in 4 days, like mine. They told me that the policy is in writing, but I've never saw it. The only document I have from them is a piece of paper that looks like a restaurant order ticket. That's all!As I waited for the staff to figure out how to redeem my gift card, I was forced to listen to their lamenting their very existence (the gift cards not the staff), as well as the existence of the abundance of deals offered by the spa's management. After twenty minutes of waiting I eventually got up and left. Their services may or may not be good, I will never know, but their customer service is not.Pei Wei gets the bozack.

Super weak and fake (Chinese?) food.  It's like a sad, upscale aspiring Panda Express.  They even used that ubiquitous chopsocky type font from the 70's you usually see on karate schools and Chinese takeout boxes.  Panda Express is hokey too, but at least they know it.

I had some kind of beef noodle dish which I can only describe as severely overcooked ramen noodles with strips of teriyaki style beef.  They also put about 10 whole green onions in my bowl, which I thought was pretty funny.  

Another thing that bugs me is that, I think whoever is behind Pei Wei just lumps all things asian together and can't distinguish the differences.Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that againOn our fancy night out in Vegas, we went to Mario Batali's Enoteca San Marco in the Venetian, and I don't think I've ever experienced service this bad.

We waited for our table for about half an hour before we were seated towards the front of the restaurant. The bus boy pretty much waited on us throughout our entire meal. We probably met the, might I mention, "rude" waiter only once briefly to give us cold and burnt bread and take our order. After that, he disappeared. No one there came by to fill up our water glasses, no one came by to give us our check, no one even asked how our meal was.

We ordered the vongole pizza with clams, mozzerella and chili and the rigatoni with roasted cauliflower ragu, chili, rosemary. I do admit the pizza was good. It had the crispy thin crust that I like. But, the pasta was a disappointment. It was luke warm and had no presentation what-so-ever. It looks like the chef just threw it on a plate and called it a day.

Et all, I was very disappointed with the restaurant. On my last night in Vegas, I was hoping to have a nice fancy meal, but ended up at a restaurant where they treat you like crap and serve you crappy food.I used to come here every 2 weeks religiously, but I got sick of their nasty attitudes, crooked tips & shit talking.  I had a Korean friend come in with me once, and she confirmed that they were talking shit about every customer in there at the time.  

Avoid this place at all costs.The worst, awful, restaurant.   

 The worst restaurant of my life. Today, I  think of the name and it honestly makes me vomit!!!!!!!!!  EEEEEEeeeK.   My background I'm a registered dietitian and also have a certificate in Foodservice Sanitation.   

Now I can continue with my story, my husband and I took a weekend trip to Las Vegas about two weeks ago and decided to stop by Ocean One Bar and Grille to eat before the big shopping spree on our last day in Vegas. 

Let me start by saying that the first thing that most people notice is the service.  Your waiter has to at least look the part and act like he likes his job.  Well, my friends my waiter was BAD simply the worst.  Like good people that we are, we didn't want to say anything because we felt that it wasn't his fault maybe just having a bad day.    I truly believe that he was having a bad day or something. It took about 30 min for our waiter to take our order.  Second, our main entree came before our appetizers.  

For the sake of the reader, I ordered  oysters and calamari for my appetizer and  both my husband and I ordered pasta for our main entree.  While eating my pasta my oyster arrived and to my surprise after eating a couple of oyster and moving the empty shells to an empty plate  I FOUND A WORM IN MY NEXT TO OYSTERS, A LIVE, MOVING, WORM IN MY PLATE  OF OYSTERS.  

I started to gage and ran to the washroom. My husband called the waiter and, of course, the waiter took it's sweet time HE finally came to the table and asked my husband "what was the problem".  I showed him my plate and the worm and said nothing but took the plate and came back with my check and charged me for my food and the oysters.  No apology of any kind.  Without make a big scene, my husband calmly asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came to our table and asked the same stupid question, "what was the problem."  My husband explain the problem and he said, "what do you want me to do? Sorry?" in an upset tone, as though he was not sorry.  We had paid for our dinner and my husband took the bill and took the money and told the manager, I thought that you would AT LEAST APOLOGIZE  for which he responded  "I ALREADY SAID SORRY WHAT DO YOU WANT" with an attitude.   

Needless to say, please before you go to this restaurant read my review and hope that you make a good decision before  ordering something from this awful restaurant.Being that I was out of town for the long weekend and was in the mood for some coffee, we "Yelped"  and found this location. It's an outdoor setting primarily used for karaoke and entertainment with tables and chairs decorating the front lawn. We made our way into the historic house which has been converted into a coffee house.    The lady at the counter (older lady, butch haircut with tattoos) asked what we were having and I kindly asked for any suggestions.  The menu contained numerous items and I was hoping she can help me make a decision or at least help stir me in the right direction.  What happened next, I wouldn't have expected in a million years.  She rudely replied that she does not know what I like, therefore, she can't make any recommendations. I usually ask for recommendations especially from new places and I've never had this type of response. Again, I proceeded to explain what would be considered their signature drink, something popular with their customers and she again insisted not to help me or willing to make any suggestions.  I have asked bartenders, waiters, waitresses and baristas this question many times and I have yet to get a response like this one.  They are always friendly and more than willing to share their top sellers or most popular drinks. I was so floored by her response and attitude that I simply decided not to give her my business, walked-out with no drink and appalled by her rude behavior.  If ever I'm in Glendale, I know NEVER to visit this coffee house again.I've eaten here 3 times.  3 times I've given one of these places a shot, but today is the last time.  If you're into bland, no spices whatsoever, no taste whatsoever, prepared food, lots of preservatives in your prepared food...mmmmm, this be the place!
Everything here is horrible except for the salad and an occasional soup.  
Never again.  I'd rather wait till I get home than eat at this dull place.Service was slow and inattentive. It was a long wait for food to come in, even though there was only 3 people at the restaurant. 

I ordered soondubu but the soup was like water and the tofu was firm, not soft. There was no flavor what so ever....just a pot of soup with few pieces of carrots and tofu cubes inside. It was just a very sad and disappointing dish that I had to fork $10 for.  I had to get some sweets to make up for the lack of a meal afterwards. :/I really don't see what the hype is about these cupcakes. Maybe they are better in Beverly Hills... i honestly don't know. I DO know the Scottsdale locations is overrated and the cupcakes aren't good. It's a pretty spot but I obviously don't spend almost 50 bucks on 12 cupcakes for the look of the place. 

The only person who liked the cupcakes was my dog. He has the doggy treats... but then again he is a garbage disposal and will eat anything so he is kinda biased. 

When I went in to pick my cupcakes there was a fly in the cupcake area... just flying around and sitting on most of the cupcakes. I informed her about it and she just threw one away and I'm basically looking like what about the others... (I feel sorry for the next person who came in) 

That place cost too much money to have flies flying around on the cupcakes and they not be sanitary enough to throw them out and make all knew batches. 

To top it off the cupcakes were gross, and we ended up wasting half the dozen. I obviously don't eat cupcakes for them to be bitter. If I'm going to intake the calories it better be sweet and heaven like. 

In conclusion I just don't understand why people are flipping their wigs over these cupcakes. :(While the units are beautiful and spacious, the staff at the leasing/management office effectively eliminates this benefit. In the six months we have lived here we are on our third set of staff. No one knows what the previous one had done or promised so anything we were given or promised by the staff when we moved in was stripped away or forgotten. They care nothing for current residents, have no documentation or note system to track any conversation and have never returned a call. They operate with zero skill set to effectively manage a property. I am a business consultant and I would have fired all of the previous set and the current one. There were two capable people when we moved in but then again, they may have just been nice since they were trying to get us to sign the dotted line. Not worth it folks, big no for me.This place is old, dirty and attracts an older crowd.  Not a good place if you are a young hipster.I use to love this place until they escorted me out in my heels...clear plastic of course.This is a such Company. I should read this before I buy IT.

***   BAD SERVICES *****

                            + $28 service
                             + $15 for delivery .
                         -------------------------
          I end up paid $223.00 
But they Never Delivery and I paid for Taxi to pick up ticket  . If you buy ticket at Bellagio for this show you PAY $119.00 and if you lost ticket they still print another for you to get in. The Manage at the theater tell me to call my agent because they couldn't found my name . I call my agent but they couldn't help me to get in . I need to buy another ticket to get in . That is such . I paid $223.00 and I can not get in to the show.
If you lost a ticket . They are not respond and refund . What kind the service they have . Why they charge for service when they don't have it . 
 DO NOT BUY TICKET  HERE  !!!!!!Very unsatisfied with the FOOD. Service was great, but our steak and double cheeseburger were burnt - not to mention the fries were just dabbed with seasoning in the middle and not spread out, COLD TOO. I used to enjoy coming to their café for their graveyard specials, but now it seems the cook is different. I don't really recommend coming for a quick bite to eat there.THis place has really lost so much fuel for me. I used to pump it up to those I knew who put it down. not anymore. If you cant beat them join them. j/k. 
Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, not 15, hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes. My guess was b/c I dont have a pair ... well the pair the waitresses are looking for to get big "tips" from. 
The sadest part, the manager looked me in the eye, 2x. and never even asked what I'd like to order. you can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed (she's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks. 
I told my bf who loves this place, to count me out - he now sees it the light and started going bk to Rum Runner and Apache Joe's. 

The service at apache joe's is far more courteous.. not always consistently the same people but at least the girl bartenders notice you are there!!!I wish right now I had zero stars for this overpriced fool you into the web of sweet cream!!! I should of looked at my YELP application on my i-phone before being lured over by a "free taste". Dirty four letter word: FREE. My A$$ FREE with two small double scoops being $36. WTF? No way was I or my hubby going to pay that. We walked away with them paying for being such scammers. I understand I was in a tourist trap high end shops type of mall, but come on ICE CREAM/Gelato being more bucks then the booze slushy? At least with the booze slushy I have a nice buzz!!! 
DO NOT BE THE LICKER of the moment for these CIty Slickers of  ripping you off.I went to this place with my son and my husband.  The place was packed!! I had never felt more uncomfortable in any other place I have been to.  I had never experienced someone treating me differently because of the language I spoke.  I was speaking to my son in spanish when the waitress came up and she rolled her eyes.  I asked her if she had a problem and she was like "no, what are you going to order?", I ignored it and ordered some food.  By the time it got there my son was getting antsy and all the staff ( the waitress, hostess, manager) were looking at us.  I asked the waitress to wrap up the food to go cause I hate listening to children cry when Im eating and Im sure other people do to, so I was going to leave.  The manager came up and asked if there was a problem and I said no that my son was just antsy, the waitress and hostess laughing in the background looking at us.  I then said to the manager how uncomfortable it was how everyone was treating us.  He followed by saying  'I don"t believe they would do that, I wouldn't allow it."  I said "I am not asking you if you believe me or not I am telling you what happened".  Long story short, we left.  The food I ate in the car sucked, seriously not just cause I was upset.  I have ordered food to go from mimmy's for breakfast and it kicked ass this was just bland!  I would recommend Denny's over this place.I hope the People that own LAX would Read this review.

There is basically no dance floor, the floor is a aisle that people just walk through spilling there drinks on you. A club is where you can dance and have fun. Not just to walk and spill your drinks thats a waste of money. I will never come back there again due to they just want to profit on people paying for bottle service instead of having a dance floor.Crazy Line
Poor attitude from staff.
Bartender refused to provide tap water with drinks (answer "you can buy bottled" .. sure, when I've just bought 3 drinks that you pre-tipped) 
Nowhere to sit unless you've bought a table with bottle service.
Beware.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!

We can't go back there. Went there for the first time tonight and was expecting great food. We walked in, no one came up to greet us. Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette. Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude. We picked a table and sat down. They were slow to give us our menus. We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's. The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses. We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade. The absolute worst was when we went up to pay, they never handed us a bill and overcharged us. The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him, just spat out a number "$33.16!" without doing any kind of math. He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card. Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash, he barked, "Didn't you see the sign?! We take cash!" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off. Their signage is confusing. There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said "we are now accept credit and debit cards." 

Also, the place is filthy. Dirty floors, walls, and windows. The bathroom smells like hot ass. For some reason, the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does. Absolute worst! We've had great food and service at Lolo's! They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed. I love the servers at Lolo's; they are attentive, friendly, and helpful. I can't believe the two families are related. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!Go to the original in San Antonio instead. Vegas transplants good stuff from everywhere but this location is a poor imitation of the original. Food is just OK and too expensive like everything else on the strip. 

Our waitress wasn't surly she just spent the evening flirting with my husband. The gimmick with Dick's is they are supposed to sarcastic and insulting perpetuating a good time. Whatever, I wasn't impressed with the food, atmosphere or waitstaff. 

Typical tourist trap. Skip it.Done with this place, first few times it was cool, our last visit the band was so loud you can't hear the rest of your party.  They refused to split our bill, and we saw our waitress about 3x for a party of 10.  She brought beers to the table even when we said no more.  DONE!Took my buddy here to sober him up.  Food was way over priced.  Way better places to eat on the strip.  Save your money for the bars, strip clubs and the poker tables.WORST place in Vegas to party.  I have lived in this city for 18 years.  All I can figure is that they have way too much business due to tourists and could care less about customer service.  Cuz there's no way they would make it in the real world.   Don't waste your time or money.  There's a million other places in Vegas that deserve it.Eek! Methinks not is right! I dont know why or how i keep finding myself at this place. I haven't had one good experience. One time, the place is suppose to be open at 10am and was still closed at 11am?!?! WTF Another time, they over steeped the tea and release all the tanin, the tea was soo gross and dry. Train your staff to know different teas have different steeping times AND temps. I really have no idea why i don't just go down to the coffee bean.

The staff seems friendly enough. The decor, LOVE the teas in the drawers, feels very chinese herb traditional. They have such huge potential to become a great place, but have been lacking everytime i go. I really truly hope they can get there one day, i love their concept.Worst sushi experience in Vegas. Amazed they're still open. Over priced tiny portions. Huge disappointment.If you live near fresh water (San Francisco, Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab, no, - scallops - no, prawns eh, no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ. 
Veggies are good 
Wait staff is good
Mojito was GREAT - not a mixMy chicken was burnt, the side that was black was facing down to hide it! I sent it back and ordered a rare steak. It came out  well done and full of gristle. Their idea of making amends, was to ONLY charge for the burnt chicken, but took off the steak! Unbelievable! We won't be back!Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back.If I could give it less than 1 star  I would! This show is a complete waste of time and money. The only reason it exists is the brand name of "Cirque" and to take money from unsuspecting tourists.

I have seen "O", Mystere, and Zoomanity several times and most of the traveling shows and have loved them all. 

"Love" on the other hand is terrible and not worth the time or money. 95% of the show is a bunch of teenagers dressesd in 70's costumes running around on stage dancing to Beatles music, with no plot and no "wow" moments like the other shows have. The highlight is literally 4 guys dressed as the Beatles on roller blades going over a couple of ramps. 

Trust me save,  if you really like the Beatles, your $300 would be much better spent buying all their albums!Overated!  Boring, boring, boring!  Did I say boring?

Not a real Cirque show!  Lots of running around but very little performance.  

Go to a real Cirque show like O!I've been here twice.  The service is great; the margaritas are great; the food sucks.  Both times my meals tasted like an old shoe.  I'm not sure how they get that exact flavor in the food on two separate occasions but it is not good.  Two strikes you're out.Went here recently and it smelled like open sewage; I think they were burning incense to hide the bad smell. (actually I have been here twice and it smelled like sewage both times) The men's bathroom is disgusting, the service is horrible, a customers food was left next to me at the bar for several minutes until the waitress picked it up to bring to a customers table (anyone could have played with the food during that time). The bartender couldn't handle more then 3 customers, the decor is pathetic and looks like a sloppy college student decorated his dorm room with all his sports posters; I expected to see a pile of dirty socks and underwear in the corner.
They don't appear to have much to choose from for drinks, don't expect any quality liquor; the menu is very standard. Didn't dare try the food.

It's too bad, I could really like this place, because the location is great.I've been to Fuzzy's twice now and don't think I'll be returning, the first time my Wife and I went about a year ago we couldn't find a seat inside.  the sign said seat yourself we sat on the patio and after about 20 minutes a server never acknowledged our presence.  Even though they looked at our table several times.

The second time was after a work christmas party with a few friends we stumbled in about 10PM to check out their Karaoke, some interesting characters, this time the server acknowledged us and brought us a round of drinks but they never checked on us again over a period of maybe 45 minutes to an hour, and eventually I went to the bar and asked for the tab.  Oddly enough the people that seemed like regulars we're getting service.

dissappointing to say the least.I honestly can't understand how I received such bad service from a hotel that receives 4 stars. 

I first want to explain my circumstance as to why I'm even writing this review. I originally stayed at the Venetian in April for a random trip with the girls. After a long weekend, both my friend and I notice that we had money taken from our wallets. She was missing a 50 dollar bill and I was missing 45 out of my own wallet. Now yes, normally any one can say "oh you were drunk you probably misplaced it" but as an avid Vegas goer - I can clearly state that this was my weakest trip I had been on. No drunken stupors were had this weekend. When I had called the security to make the report, not only did i have to talk to several guest services employees but I also had to wait in my room on a Sunday for them to come. When the security guard arrived, he plainly stated to me that no employee of the hotel would have taken it. (First instance of blame the guest). I was promised a call back within 48 hours about their findings. In the end, the check out time took 4 hours. Did I receive a call within 48 hours? No I did not. I then had to take more time out of my day to contact guest services. Luckily I got a hold of Marcus, who by the way was the nicest man, and he could not provide me a report on what may have happened with my missing monies. He then provided me a complimentary upgrade and 1 free night at the Palazzo. I agreed and left the headache right there. 

Several months go by and my sister offers to take me back to Vegas for a graduation trip. To help save money on the room and spend more gambling, I decided to use my certificate for a free night. I called in once and spoke with Theresa in Guest Services and inquired about rates and fees and she indicated to me that it would be best to call back and book with payment so that I can lock in the rates. I waited until payday and called back and booked. All credit card info was provided. Done. 

I get to Vegas this past Friday (9/27) and they advised me that the room went unpaid and that I owed a balance. Now mind you, I had harassed all my friends for payment. Why would I do that if I was properly told that I could pay when I got there? None of that was mentioned during the 2nd phone call when I provided my CC information. By that point I was upset bc not only was I misinformed but no one could understand why I would be upset and they continued to state that their employees would have told us the proper info (Second instance of placing the blame). Seeing how irate I was, they offered a 25.00 restaurant credit (whoopee). I ended up having to clear out my savings to cover the price of the night. They had advised me to call the guest services manager if I wanted to further complain. I advised them to contact me directly bc I wasn't going to wait in the room for a call when my trip was already off to a bad start. 

I get into our room and the guest services representative Theresa calls me back only to state that I was wrong. (Third instance of blaming) and that I never discussed pricing with her or booking. Why else would I be calling? For fun? (Fourth instance of blaming). I plainly asked her if she was telling me that as a customer, I was wrong and it wasn't her fault. By this point, I didn't want a resolution I wanted to explain why I was unhappy - what I didn't want was to be blamed AGAIN. I hung up and my friend called back bc by that point I was so frustrated I ended up taking back shots to calm myself. She spoke with Theresa manager who said nothing Theresa had said was wrong. (Fifth instance of blame on the customer). We eventually got no where. 

Please keep in mind - at no point was I reaching for more free loot. I was simply trying to explain why I was upset to someone who would listen. 

I have stayed at the Venetian/Palazzo several time before I was mistreated without issues. Now - I will never stay there again. 

They have no respect for their customers. They will blame you to cover their own behind. And to get any assistance, it's like pulling teeth. 

So if you want to pay big bucks for a pretty place with a comfy bed and you dont care about the service, then Venetain Palazzo is your best bet.Not a review on their food or drinks (don't really recall) but their service.  I was flipped off by my waitress after leaving the restaurant.  (My friend paid the bill since we were out celebrating my b-day, so no clue on tip other than there was one).  I have no desire to go to a place where an employee would do that to a paying customer, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.If I could give zero stars I would. This show was terrible. I would have rather put the money I spent on the tickets into a hopeless slot machine. Superstars were unrealistic, and did not look like real singers. Overall, this show was a bust.I read Yelp about this, but still I went.  I was a prisoner to Luxor.  How bad can it be?!

DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING

You have been warned.  There is a reason why you can't see the food until after you pay!  The manager refunded me and you could tell he's done this countless times.  He seemed defeated.

Run!  Run far away!Nice service, but the food/entertainment was sub-par. $90 for 2 people, don't think I'd like to go back. Food TV did a whole bit on it and it wasn't as cracked up to be. :(You may be familiar with the term food porn. That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook. Food at the Sao Paulo cafe at the Rio definitely falls into the snuff porn category.

None of my friends were able to finish the food, because it was so horrible. We only ate there, because we had a conference meeting in the hotel and no time to look for food outside.I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. 

Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. 

You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.I stopped going here after a completely horrible customer service experience. The cupcakes are fun, but the way the manager handled an order mishap left me speechless and searching for alternative cupcake places (there are many).One word- Terrible. After doing some major shopping around Tempe Marketplace, my girlfriend and I were HUNGRY!!! We were headed towards The Keg but upon passing San Felipe's Cantina we decided to detour. We were initially drawn to the restaurant because of it's festive decor and indoor/outdoor seating. The thought of munching on some chips and salsa over a girly conversations sounded great too! Boy were we WRONG!!! Once inside the restaurant, we soon found out that there couldn't be more to dislike about this place. The seating was uncomfortable, the staff was loud and scantily clad, and the food-ugh!! We ordered chips & salsa and a chicken and cheese quesadilla . My thought process was "how can anyone mess up chips&salsa or a quesadilla?!! So simple, right? O.M.G. Both were horrible. The basket of chips came out in a messy heap. There were two small salsa bowls but because they were placed in the basket so sloppily, salsa had spilled everywhere and the chips were soggy. Nothing worse than soggy chips. The quesedilla didn't deliver either. Bland and soggy. What a disappointment.I have Multiple Sclerosis, I can walk somewhat. However I can't walk well enough to make it through a Walmart. This one does not have any courtesy carts, they don't own any.... unlike every other mid to large store in the country. Which is not really surprising since this store is so run down and dirty, you can just see no one cares or cleans anything. I'm pretty happy I can't physically shop there and had to leave.Meh... I am not a fan. I went here for happy hour one time, and I was beyond disappointed. They must've had their D list chefs working... Cuz my food was GROSS. I couldn't even finish it. Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.Food is good but the service and attitude of the staff makes this a no go placeDon't waste your money or your time.

What's wrong with this place:
1) You have to fill out a paper form to order your sandwich. This wouldn't be so ridiculously moronic if you didn't ALSO have to wait while the person working the register has to type in everything you just hand wrote down on the brown paper sack your sandwich ends up being delivered to you in.
2) The wait. Waiting. I'm still waiting... Now we have ONE of the two sandwiches from our order... 10 minutes later... finally we have our entire order. 10 minutes after we placed the order. TEN PLUS MINUTES FOR A SANDWICH. I don't mean to be overly negative, but at Subway I not only watch them make and toast my sandwich, it takes about four minutes from start to finish if there's no one in line ahead of me. This was the case at Which Wich. No one was ahead of me and I waited more than ten minutes per sandwich. Between having to fill our an order form by hand, waiting for the woman behind the counter to enter that form, then waiting for them to make the sandwich it took nearly 20 minutes. That is an abysmal failure of service. 
3) The food is just not worth the price or the wait. My sandwich was $9.00, it took more than 10 minutes to make, and I honestly couldn't finish it. I ordered a turkey sandwich, my wife order a turkey and ham club. In both cases the meat was minced. To be clear I mean it was chunked and what could only be described as put through a grinder so that the texture of the meat was unrecognizable to the original source of said meat. It was disgusting. It wasn't edgy, interesting, or unique. It was just gross. I literally couldn't finish it.

What's REALLY wrong with this place:
1) It feels like the concept was designed by a fifth grade teacher. It's essentially designed to make you follow a process that is both totally unnecessary and repetitious.  
2) When I asked the woman at the counter if I could just tell her what I want she said, "No." After I filled out the paper bag and handed it to her she asked me, "Did you figure it out okay?" So what she's really asking is if I'm too stupid to fill out a form. Thanks for insulting me, then serving me terrible food for which I over paid. 
3) All the food on a single order should come up at the same time. By the time my sandwich FINALLY appeared, my wife was more than half done with her food. The entire process on which this restaurants is based is designed to create a "UNIQUE" customer experience that really just translates into a stupid waste of time. 

What's good about this place:
Nothing. Seriously. Don't go here.I'm so done with this place. I ordered for the last time the other day as they are scammers. We order to-go food from here because they actually put out a rather tasty product but the process is just way too painful. Just placing the order is an incredible task as the people answering the phone speak next to know English.  Don't dare tag me a racist as I'm far from that but it's reality that you need to convey an order and have it made correctly - that's basic. To exacerbate this their on-line menu is conveniently numbered but it's THE WRONG ONE further adding to the confusion. What a hot mess. The last few orders we have gotten home and the order is wrong...errrrr! The topper is the last two times they have tried to scam when we had a coupon and that is where the line gets drawn when you lack integrity with your customers.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4Amj0F2Pk&feature=g-upl&context=G2f125afAUAAAAAAALAAChef Mario Batali should cringe that his name is associated with this restaurant. For Carnevino did not even deliver on the basics on our recent visit. 

First of all- this place has a high bar given all the talk about it and the prices that it charges. It was highly recommended to us so we decided to take our group there on our last night in Las Vegas. 

From the moment that we entered- the place was not up to a "fine dining" restaurant . . . .and trust me- I eat out alot. 

Our waiter had an attitude from the moment he walked over- wanting to know "who was in charge" and tossing menus and wine lists at us. We appointed a "person in charge" just because it seemed without it- nothing was going to move forward. 

Everything we asked for seemed to be an issue for this waiter. We wanted several appetizers to share for the table. He wanted to know exactly how many of each versus just figuring it out as a good waiter would. 

Two of us asked to split a steak and to have it sliced- he acted like it was huge imposition but we saw it being done at other tables in the place. 

Our wine sat unpoured on the back table until one from our group got up to pour the table some wine. Pouring our own wine? Really? At a fine dining restaurant? Unheard of. 

At this point- I called the manager over- but she was not very helpful other than getting our water glasses filled. I expected to her to minimally check back with us before we left to see if things had gotten any better.  But she didn't.  She didn't care either.

Our salads came up and were so bitter and salty that they were inedible so we sent them back. The pasta dish we ordered was no better than "Chef Boyardee". So far- service and the food were untenable for a fine dining restaurant. 

The best thing of the night? The steaks- but it takes a lot to mess those up. They were done perfectly and were quite tasty. But at $54 a steak- I would expect nothing less. 

This service debacle went on for 2.5 hours and at the end when we received our $1100 bill you can bet that the obligatory 20% tip for our server -who was terrible- was put right on there. Hard to believe.

There was no other compensation from the restaurant for the bad service other than they didn't charge us for the salads we didn't eat. 

Plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas. Too bad this isn't one of them.What a joke. I must preface my review by saying that I'm not accustomed to eating at restaurants like this, where prices are so high you need to mortgage your house just to have dinner. But I was vacationing in Vegas with a large group of friends and this is where they wanted to eat. So I gave it a shot!

One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was going to break the bank. I took a moment to map out my game plan and decided on ordering the ravioli plus a side item so my wallet wouldn't take too much of a beating. My wife, also alarmed by the prices decided to order the gnocchi and a side item (quick recap, with a little wine we're way over $100 at this point. ouch)

My first red flag should have been when the waiter pointed out that the "ravioli" was actually a "raviol-o" - as in singular - as in just one piece of ravioli - as in what the hell? I scratched my head. $25 for 1 ravioli?? The price must be wrong or it must be a huge, delicious, giant, thick piece of ravioli. I asked the waiter to describe it and with his hands he made a rather large circle. So I assumed it would be a decent sized dish. OK I'll order it.

HA! 45 minutes later (yes 45 minutes) I was served the tiniest, thinnest, smallest ravioli you have ever seen. It was roughly the the size and thickness of a ritz cracker. 1 cracker. for $25!! Then came my "side item", also rather small. I wish I had a stopwatch at the dinner table - it took me about 45 seconds to eat everything. Roughly 3 spoonfuls and I was done!

My friends (all of whom have large bank accounts) ordered many dishes. I was shocked at how small everything was. A a spoonful here, a tiny dollop there, and somehow these "dishes" were worthy of $50 price tags. I just sat there in disbelief. I sat there watching other people eat because I had already blown my $100 on my single ravioli and my wifes pasta. 

In the end our bill came out to roughly $200 - for two people who basically ate nothing and drank a little wine. It was so bad it ended up ruining the rest of my night. I was not a happy camper and while everyone else went back to gambling I grabbed a slice of pizza at the hotel (delicious, i should have eaten there) and went to my room to watch tv. 

Look - I understand that there are lots of people out there with money to burn who like to live that way - they're willing to spend $50 on a tiny scoop of pasta because the restaurant is "exclusive" and has a big fancy chef's name attached to it - but give me a break! My "raviolo" didn't even taste good! It had almost no flavor and my side dish tasted microwaved. My wife said her gnocchi was fine but she had tasted better pasta at small chain restaurants back home. 

My wife summed it up best when she turned to me at the table and whispered: this is the most pretentious place I have ever been to in my life.

0 stars if I could.One of the worst experiences ever...Fantastic food, but I wish I could give this location zero stars for my experience.  

On Father's Day (two weeks ago) my family went to Black Bear Diner to celebrate my Grandfather.  There was a total of five adults and we ended up spending about $50.  The food was absolutely worth the money!  I got "The Griz" and it arrived on two gigantic plates filled to the brim.  It tasted great and was satisfying.  We were also celebrating a Birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her.  

The place was busy and a little messy inside, but this is to be expected on a day like this.  Up until this point, we were having a great time, but going to the restrooms changed everything!

I had to take my very elderly Grandfather to the men's room, where there was what appeared to be a Black Bear Diner worker (wearing one of their shirts) exiting a stall, that was not properly flushed.  There was a second Black Bear Diner worker entering the men's room behind us.  The two workers exchanged fist bumps and words, before the first worker (who just left a used toilet) exited the men's room WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!  I know he didn't wash his hands because since I was holding the door open for my Grandfather, my back was to the sinks and watched him slip right out the door.  

If I did not have to constantly be at my Grandfather's side, i would have followed the worker out of the men's room and confronted him.  To add insult to injury, there is a sign next to the sinks saying employees must wash hands.  After exiting the men's room and washing up, we left immediately.  My stomach was churning thinking that this guy might have handled food without having clean hands.  As we left, a worker at the front desk was notified and she said she would take care of it.  

I left an email that night with the main email address for Black Bear Diner and the Gilbert store.  After one week, I did not have any response, so I went to Facebook, where they finally responded.  I ended up speaking to a very nice lady at the Black Bear Diner headquarters.  However, since this location is a franchise store, it seems that headquarters cannot do much.  I told the lady at their headquarters to pass along my contact info to the Gilbert store.  It has been two weeks since the visit and have not heard anything from the Gilbert store.  

The best food in the world can not make up for a worker not washing their hand after using the restroom.I can not stand this restaurant. Every time I go the food is inconsistent.  I've had the "Dave's Special" (not on menu but my co-worker goes so much there is a dish named after him) with salmon, sauteed spinach, pasta, and tomatoes tossed in olive oil.  I've given this dish a try a couple of  times and each was different. Once the fish portion was slight but the spinach was perfectly sauteed and wilted. Second time, the fish portion was large but we had a BIG bowl of spinach, little bit of pasta and hardly any tomatoes and the spinach was raw - never touched the skillet.  
So I give another dish on the menu a try - the appetizer of bruschetta with prosciutto, brie, apple, 3 different types. The brie was all rind and the prosciutto is like the kind you get at the Albertson's deli.  Really!?
I no longer frequent this restaurant and boycott it if its an option for an office birthday lunch.We were ignored by the servers, received the wrong wine on a re-order and the food was disappointing. I will not come back.OMG, we stayed at Harrah's and happened to past by the cafe after clubbing and saw this huge steak and eggs deal for $5.99. When the food came, the steak was so chewy and wasn't cooked right. The hashbrown was cold, the only thing that was decent are the eggs.This is a faux healthy market. They have stuff with hydrogenated oils here. Read the labels!!!!!!!!!!!

Its not all healthy Buyer beware!!!!

I hate theis place. Plus Trader Joes is cheaper anywayThis was the worst customer service I've experienced anywhere in a long time. Tonight our party of four arrived and sat at the bar and ordered a round of beers. Noticing that a booth in the bar area opened up, we asked the bartender if we could take the booth, he said yes and we politely closed our tab with him and took our beers with us to the booth. When we sat down, a server came up to us and asked, "Do you need a server?" and we said, not at this time but we could use more drinks in a while. Then a second server came up to us and she asked if we needed food. We now felt as though something was wrong so we asked if we should not be seated in the booth and she said yes, we shouldn't be seated there but it was not big deal. It was obvious it was a big deal because she could not hide her negative attitude and sour expression. So, in short, we were made to feel bad for being seated in the wrong location even though our intention was to enjoy a few rounds of drinks over conversation. We were checked upon  every 5 minutes and felt rushed and uncomfortable by our server the remainder of the night. Sorry Cadillac Ranch, your poor customer service means a loss of 4 customers who will not be back. Good luck, there are too many other great places to choose from for drinks and relaxation at Tempe Market Place.If you really are a experience foodie whom loves seafood, you are going to hate this place. I went with my Mom and Husband and we ordered the fried Alligator to start. It wasnt bad  with the first bite but the longer it sat it turned into some weird texture. We love the Fried Alligator at Pappadeaux and was excited to have a restaurant closer to our homes that serves it. It looked different, taste different and really made us wonder what we were eating.

For our Main dishes, I ordered the boiled shrimp, hubby had catfish, and mom the Etoufee. My shirmp looked good when they came, however when I went to eat them i noticed that there were not cleaned. You can see a clear sign of both veins in the top and bottom of the shirmp. Mind you I am a seafood junkie and I have had shrimp in Hawaii from a truck and prepared the same way and were cleaned. I told the manager about this and he said that they don't clean their shrimp nor did they have too. I sent them back and did not order anything else. My mom's Etouffee looked like a can of Cream of Chicken soup an jiggled like Jello. Matter of fact it was the exact color of Cream of Chicken soup. If you have never had Etouffee this might fly. However, I have had my first experience with Cajun Cusine in New Orleans, LA and none of this looked or tasted like Cajun cusine. 

Now to my husbands Catfish?? I really don't believe it was Catfish. It was shaped like Chicken Breast and the texture was totally different. 

Needless to say, I am a extreme foodie who dines out at least 4x a week or more. I love Cajun food and was so excited to have a place closer to my house than my favorite in  West Phoenix, Pappadeaux's.

However, besides this food not tasting good, it is a disgrace to everything that relates to Cajun Cuisine. We gladly left while not to mention the Manager, Bar Tender, and waitress all decided to go for a smoke break in the front of the restaurant while patrons were still eating. We said goodbye and never returned again.Took our scooter in to get the stator replaced almost a month ago. Every single week they have had some excuse as to why it was not done. Last week we went in and were promised it would be done by Tuesday (today), but no surprise it still had not been touched.I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. 

When we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. 

I have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a "Jack of all trades and a King of NONE." As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the "YARD HOUSE". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their "famous" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. 

When they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. 

A few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to "remake" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.



Shortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some "fancy" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. 


My husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. 

Halfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the "fresh" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.



Anyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here.I am honestly baffled that this horrible place has so many good reviews. I will never eat here again. I'm just glad we only bought 1 of the restaurant.com coupons.

First off, they picked just about the worst place to have their restaurant, there's no parking at all. We had about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a Friday evening. There was a mix up and they tried to seat the same party twice, when we told them those people had already been seated they made us feel like we were lying just to get the table. Between that and the parking we were all already pretty annoyed. 

Once we were seated we got our drinks pretty quickly, but for the rest of the night we had to flag some one down to get refills. We decided what we were getting but we weren't sure if they wanted us to mark it down on the paper menus they give you (since we've been to some places that just use them as menus and don't like you writing on them) the waitress finally came back, when we started to tell her what we wanted she was like "Oh, you have to fill that out" and left, didn't even give us a pen or anything. She didn't show up again for at least another 10 minutes and another waiter had taken pity on us (he was also the one who we usually ended up asking to get our refills) and taken our order. 

Now to the food! We got 2 orders of Gyoza, they were pretty good but very soggy. Not just in a non-fried way, but more a fried and then left in water for a while kind of texture, it was rather off-putting. They didn't get our second order of Gyoza out until we'd finished our rolls. Our friends ordered chicken fried rice and a Philly roll, they said both were good but they'd had better. My husband and I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a las vegas roll and a haha roll. The tempura had been overcooked and they actually had the nerve to make the bottom half of the roll a double layer of rice and seaweed! The haha roll was mediocre at best. The las vegas roll was actually very good but we had to scarf it down because they'd forgotten to make it for us (we didn't see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after they dropped off the food) and we were late for a movie. 

They're just very cheap, they only give you 5 piece rolls and they use seriously huge pieces of cucumber and carrots so they can skimp on more expensive ingredients. I assume they do this because they offer all you can eat and because they're one of the only sushi places here that do that people apparently are content to let them get away with it. In areas where all you can eat is something you find in almost every sushi restaurant (Nevada) this is so not acceptable.  I imagine that the all you can eat option is the only reason they've stayed in business as I know of a few other sushi joints that are much, much better within a 15 minute drive. 

I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option.It's located in an old house on 7th St. in the Coronado area.  Patio is awesome and has a slight European/Spanish feel to it.  The food in the deli looked appetizing and gourmet.  I ordered the prosciutto sandwich and my wife had the sirloin.   The bread was quite good and appeared to be made on location.  The prosciutto was decent.

However the sirloin came out bloody at first which the owner admitted before even placing on our table.  It is supposed to be medium, per his admission, so we were confused why he even brought it out.  When my wife asked him about this he leered at her and said he knew what "medium meant", and then took it back to the kitchen.  Before this he talked to her rudely when she was looking for the restroom.  The restrooms are labeled in Italian which my wife speaks, along with French, Spanish, and English.  She paused in front of the door to adjust her purse and the aforementioned owner told her "that's right, it means ladies room in Italian", in a tone you would take with a child.  After the sirloin issue, my wife and I just stared at each other in disbelief at the audacity of this fat, bad mannered, self righteous man.

When the sirloin came back out it was cooked properly but lacked flavor.  The bread was the only thing worth eating on the plate.

The server who took our order was this prissy guy who lacked not only personality but any sense of being helpful.  I don't know if the owner is trying to create this New York/European "poor service because we can" atmosphere but, please, that doesn't fly here and anyone that thinks this is acceptable must have very low self esteem.  You can't talk to customers like that, I don't care how good your food may be, and in this case it was mediocre.

And to clarify, I hate chain restaurants, always try to support local business, and know good food and service when I experience it.  So it's not that I "don't get it".  I will never return to this restaurant and implore you not to go here either.  Oh, and if you are the owner, rest assured I will be scathing your restaurant on other review websites along with telling every single person I know how rude you are and how mediocre your cooking is.  I promise you will make less money because of your behavior towards my wife.This review is for their Lounge. 

I was walking with my group from Diablo Cantina to The Bellagio, and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to Brand. I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and I did not even know they had a lounge. Anyways, he confirmed with us it would be $20 bucks each. He even walked us to the line. We saw that the line was a little long, but he assured us it would only be about a five minute wait. After a while in line I noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter, was because people were leaving the front of the line. Someone from the back of the line yelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies, but some how we did not connect the dots. When we got through the rope, the girl working the line told us it would be $30 each. We confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it would be $20. She did not even consider this, and goes on and on about how it was technically Saturday night, and now we had to pay the "weekend" price. Naturally, we left. 

Either the staff had NO sufficient communication, or they were just building up a line in order to get people to come to their obscure lounge.

I'm sure it must be a lovely restaurant.$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Need i say more? 
I ordered a chicken breast dish. It was a half a breast and wouldn't fill a child. And they had the nerve to charge me $28 for that! Amazing. I don't care where I am, if i pay for a meal, it should be a meal. I am a grown man, 6'3' and 215lbs. I don't expect a buffet, but this place is a joke. 
Forgot my beer. 
Terrible sushi. 
I will upload the photos so you can see this joke in real time.Keep in mind this review is based on the first time I went to this restaurant 2 summers ago- before I lived in Las Vegas.

I went here for my cousin's ballet recital dinner and ordered the portabello burger.

"Portabello" made me think of "steak" (that's right, I didn't know what portabello was!) so I ordered it. 
When I got my burger, I bit into it and discovered that it was not a steak sammich, but a mushroom. A big mushroom.

I like mushrooms and regularly eat them- so I ate the burger. Something about it was not right though and I stopped 2/3s way through.

Later that night I was having agonizing sharp stomach pains. I was sweating and drifting in and out of sleep.

I continued to feel ill and have additional symptoms throughout the night and into the day.

I started to feel better the next night and was well enough to get out of bed, and even eat at a restaurant in the hotel.


After that experience when returning to Vegas, and eventually moving here, I've time and time again disagreed to going to cheeburger cheeburger due to this incident.

I would not recommend going there- I wouldn't even go back if I was offered free food.AVOID AVOID AVOID. I was in town visiting my parents and we wanted to take a day trip to Mount Charleston. We decided to rent a car for our trip. Well, long story short, our vehicle (a Nissan Altima with only ~13k miles on it) stopped working forty minutes later on the freeway. We were promised assistance with a replacement car within an hour. It took them FOUR freaking hours to finally get us our replacement car while we were stuck on the side of the desert, even though I gave them VERY clear instructions as to where we were. The whole time the service reps were giving me the runaround on the phone, saying that the driver was on his way and was lost. For FOUR hours? Yeah, okay.

They tried to resolve the situation later by offering us two free vouchers (note: only after my dad laid out the rage). You know how terrible this company is? Well, Chinese people tend to love free stuff, and we didn't even take those vouchers because we'd rather pay to NOT ever use this company again.

Funny story: one of the service reps on the phone told us our car failure was a "known issue" with the Altima due to changes in elevation and hot weather. WTF?! Do they know they are located in Vegas.. which is in a desert climate.. and is surrounded by mountains? And furthermore, if it's a "known issue," why continue renting this car out to people? Shady, so shady.Not a fan!  Greasy, cheap (not in a good way) Chinese food.  Came here for lunch with a few co-workers.  Ordered a lunch combo came with egg drop soup and crunch things (which we had to share).  For the combo, I had mongolian beef, which came with fried rice and noodles (hence the name).  I ate it because I was hungry, but it was completely unsatisfying.  It was a waste of calories!

The food overall just had a generic taste.  Not worth coming back to.  I'd rather go to Panda Express for greasy, Americanized Chinese food next time.Although I wanted to stay here I never ended up staying due to the reservations department.  The front page of their website prominently lists multiple package promotions.  After unsuccessfully trying to book the promotion from the website I called the reservation phone number.  The lady on the phone told me that all of the packages showed no availability on any day of any month so she would override it for me in the system.  I wasn't sure what package I wanted to I told her I would call back.  When I called back I got a different person on the phone and she refused to give me the package price.  I asked to speak with the supervisor and when I was connected to Enrique he told me I should have booked with the first agent and refused to give me the package price even though it continues to be advertised on the front page of the website.  I feel this is not only bad customer service but also bait-and-switch as they actively advertise packages that they have no intention o giving you.Check in is at 3pm the resort areas close at 5pm no swimming no spa after 5pm  yet your charged a extra resort fee becuase it is a resort. No room access to patio even though their is one but its locked. You are not informed until you arive that their is a no smoking rule for the entire premises except the parking lot. Also odd but their was a note on the bed when I checked in that sheets are only changed upon request ( sick ) makes you wonder how often they get changed. The only plus was the jucuzzi tub in the room. Everything is at the Palms it is a long walk away only thing at Palms Place is a restaurant its just a condo set up you get really nothing but to pay a high price.  I am a local in Vegas and take it from me their is much better elsewhere.Airport is airport food, not the best and kind of expensive. But when your here you have no choice. Went cause I was craving a whopper. But as soon as I got there I should have stopped and turned back around to look for something else. There was a man infront of me who had complained about his burger, I should have token that as a sign. But no. I ordered a whopper with extra onions (which is $1 extra)  and went my gate . Which was a pretty far walk from their only Burger King location. Take a bite of it and its cold and only find two slices of onion. I was really upset because I had to pay extra for it. And also, who doesn't put any pickles in a burger. If your burger on the screen is advertised with pickles, I'm sure it needed to have pickles. Never again will I go there. I will happily walk myself to the E gates to get Carl's jr.REI, you had such a good thing going...why, oh why...

Sometimes an event lives great because it offers so much more than it intends. When it's a store putting it on for the sake of it's customers (and I'd like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a sale.

We have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long. We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals). A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning wait.

But it was the people that made it. We'd hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails, lakes and camping sites.

...and then, with nervous excitement we'd charge into the parking lot like mad men, snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar, thanking the REI gods that we, the chosen few, the members, would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of prices.

Flash forward to yesterday...I evidently missed the memo that the "new and improved" garage sale was happening in the store, up in the clinic room. Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot, J. with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings. We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year. J. got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions. Several minutes later, he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale, but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were called.

I was dubious...the line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren't looking any happier than if it was 98º with screaming kids at said park. Long story short...it was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse. Once there, we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shop...we picked up a few things. set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handed.

REI management, this is an epic fail in my opinion. You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly about...and worse yet, you didn't even make the sale that we intended...you didn't sell the $53 bike seat, you didn't sell the $17.95 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 years.

Sometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin. Sometimes it's a way to show your customers the loyalty they've shown you... we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale. This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity. The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a year...is that too much to ask from a store that we've been loyal too for half our lives?I bought an annual Platinum Wash card (60 washes) a little less than a year ago and still have 35 washes left and it expires 6/14/09. I asked if they could extend it, as I bought the 60 washes at half price and they said no which basically means that I prepaid full price. 

I left a message for Joe Curry on his voicemail on 6/11 and he did not return my call. I wanted to try to work this out but they wanted no part of it.

So I invited my friends and family down this morning 6/13/09 for a car wash on my card. After 6 cars including mine were washed the owner Joe Curry said that my card was expired and that he was confiscating it. I showed him my receipt that was just printed that said my card did not expire untill 6/14/09 and he said "Nope it is expired now" and stuck my card in his pocket and asked me to leave immediately.

Theses people are very dishonest so Buyer beware!I have been here once and the food wasn't very good. We ordered the artichoke dip and and white spaghetti. The artichoke dip wasn't very good and I could have made better pasta at home. There was an Indian restaurant that opened up in the same plaza and closed down within a couple of months due to slow business. I live in the area and drive by this restaurant several times a day and it is NEVER busy and yet it is still open. Things that make you hmmm...........The food here was delicious! The dessert is very overpriced! I can get the same dessert options at Whole Foods around the corner for a quarter the price. I was disappointed about the service. We watched as all the other tables were waited on while we sat with our waters....
After we finished eating, we waited patiently for about fifteen minutes for our check. We finally pulled another waiter aside and she gladly helped us. As we walked out of the restaurant, there was our original slow waiter sitting on her phone and smoking. 
Not going to be going back. Not worth the money with service like that.So i went in to the store because i saw a lawn mower that was on their site saying its available for pick up in store. i go in and they do not have that product. Long story short. they said they will order it to come to the store and i say ok.. I order it and pay for it on the spot. i wait two weeks as the delivery said it would take. called them and guess what. they didnt even tell the warehouse to ship it and apparently lowes doesnt even carry that product. why is it on the site then and why did you make me pay for. then i wait another 4 weeks calling every monday, wed, and friday cuz the guy keeps telling me its gonna come in on those trucks. for four weeks i did this.. and when i talked to the manager ray on the 6th week. he says im so sorry ill take care of you. when i finally recieved it yesterday and i asked for him to come. he didnt even bother, he called the guy and told em hes going out for lunch and he doesnt have time for that.. lost a customer and i wont be shopping here again. even if i have to pay 10 dollars extra im going to home depot to save time and frustration. this location sucks. plus home depot said they price match on the spot. even if you show them the online ad on your phone..Horrible service every time I come here. The sales associates in mobile have absolutely no clue what they are doing and take their sweet time when there is a line. Employees are very uneducated about the products. Spare yourself the anger and don't come hereNot sure what the big deal is about their wings. They aren't that good and most of them are sorta dry. 

I think they cook them too long or something. I've tried this place 3 times and still very inconsistent with all the wings when you eat them 

Cool that you can get all these different flavors but wish the meat would be more moist. 

Service wasn't bad at all so atleast they have that. 

Also they have the UFC fight be they charge a admission which is kind of stupid IMO. And you have to spend a certain amount during the fight. Wtf is that, this place is cheap as hell

I won't be back and I go to a real bar to watch the fights without having to pay.I'd love to give a half a star but Yelp won't let me. 

I'd have lived at Roosevelt Square since may 2010, and just recently moved out at the end of September (2012) upon moving out I was hit with a $391 bill for carpet and carpet seal replacement (I'm assuming the padding under the carpet) 

The only thing they went off is just the manager doing the walk through saying she smelled cat urine (with no real evidence, black light and/or ammonia tests done by a third party) and the funny part is that I've been chain smoking cigarettes in that apartment for two years and there was no mention of her smelling that. 

The way that Berkshire did this is really just a way to extort money out of you if you're a pet owner. 

At $30 a month for having a pet and being there for 26 months and paying a $250 'non refundable deposit' I've paid over $1000 I paid to these apartments because I own a cat. That's not including the carpet replacement that I have to pay. Berkshire Properties is obviously out there to manage (and do a horrible job of it, there has been an instance where they LOST MY RENT CHECK and I had to correct one of the office workers on the correct rent amount) but to steal money from you once you move out. It seems like the general consensus with people on yelp and even with people I know personally that vacated these apartments

Please understand if you have a pet or animal of some sort and paid that non refundable deposit, YOU WILL PAY FOR THE CARPET no matter what. (using that phrase 'non refundable' and 'deposit' together is misleading because a deposit is money you pay and get back if there is no damage) So basically look at it as money you're giving to them. 

Walls are paper thin. I've had two noise complaints against me but my upstairs neighborhood could do jumping jacks, and what sounded like roller skating upstairs and no one complained about that because he/she has been doing it up to when i moved out

Stepping in dog poop on the side walk and walking by the dog waste bins that hasn't been changed out for a while was generally unpleasant, but its not too bad i guess..

The only great thing about this place is the location, being close to the 'downtown' area, and light rail. Pita jungle is awesome and Lola's and Fair trade .

be prepared to pay some money when you leave is all I'm saying people.Love the area- too bad management was horrible.

Too many stories to post, but will give you 1 just to convey their mindset.

I go out of town, have my dad check on my place and my pet, which he has done before.

He calls me to let me know the call box code wasn't working and he couldnt get in.

I call the manager the next day and ask what was up and am told-

"we disabled the codes a few months ago"

....ok well were you going to let the tenants know?

"we figured you guys would have figured it out by now"


....uhhhmmmm, well I didn't until just now and now my dad can't get into my place to check on my cat, so can you guys turn it back on so he can or give him a fob so he can open the gate and get in

"you can mail us a money order for 50 dollars and then we can give him a keyfob"

....I'm in another state, and that will take at least a day or 2 for guys get it in the mail, is there anything you can do to fix this and am in shock that your only solution is for me to mail a MO to you guys..."


it went on and on and I thought it was a prank it was so outlandish- THEY disable the call boxes, they don't let us know, then want me to mail a MO to them so my dad can get one for 3 days.....


insane


when I left that horrible manager was promoted up....and the good people in the office were on there way out


no matter how cool a place looks, NEVER move into a place with management this incompetent!

2 years there, was going to stay another, but when this was going on (and one of MANY crazy issues) I told them the way there were handling it, this would cause me to move

"do what you got to do"


ok- in Tempe now= :DOk so heres the deal. I have had alot of sushi in my time at many different places. Out if all these years I have had one bad experience. That is here at J.K Sushi
The room was pretty dang warm, not the biggest of deals but warm none the less. 
We had the lunch bowl with eel and the caterpillar, with the crunchy roll salmon jalapeno.
The beginning starter which was the miso soup was bland and flavorless. I was like ok no big deal. The lunch bowl came out. The chicken was fried with a bottled sauce thrown on top after cooked. No real flavor and bit down on some cartlidge a few times, the vegetables were under cooked also lacking in any kind of flavor. So now we have our sushi. The sliced brownish tented green caterpillar came out and it was ok. Nothing special no biggie. Its the same for the other sushi except the eel. Eel is my favorite sushi anywhere that serves it. I try it here and my eel doesnt smell right. I take a bite and to my surprise it doesn't taste good. Not a good as flavor but i honestly think they served me bad eel. The smell was so bad i can smell it as she brought it out. We pay our bill and then she asks why i didn't tip. I was very nice to her and I explained it to her in a very nice manor and she pretended not to understand me and walked away. This was my first trip and my last. I don't ever not tip which was also a first time for me. I felt bad till she snubbed me.Pathetic, especially when the concierge says its "one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the nation".  

The food, even if at half the price, would be considered uninspiring.  The service was just as bad .. but at least it was expensive.  $100 for three bad meals.

Do not eat here, it's worse than bad, it's boring and expensive.  You can pay the same amount and eat at Nobu and have a much better experience.This was the worst Indian food I've ever tried in Canada. I went there for their buffet and it was absolutely horrible. Everything was bland and you can tell they reuse their old chicken in their curries. The best Indian restaurant in the KW area is definitely Empress of India. Avoid Masala Bay as they reuse old food.The best thing about this place is the location. Really easy to get to with a lot of parking. But the food and service are really lacking. Menu was typical and bland AND typical North American cuisine. We definitely expected something a little more colorful with a name like that. The service was also spotty. The restaurant wasn't busy yet it took a few minutes to seat us, never mind serve us (and we were a group of two). I sent my food back twice: once because it was cold and the second time because the meat sauce was missing (after being sent back for heating). All in all, money not well spent. This place is pretty pricey for the area and has nothing of value to offer.Absolutely the worst restaurant in town, I cannot believe it is still in business. The place is so outdated; it looked like a scene from The Shining. All I could smell when I walked in the door was cigarette smoke. When I passed the salad bar it looked like none of the food had been changed in hours, maybe even days. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was a few dead flies in the window sill and about a quarter inch of dust on all the fake plants and the window sill. All the glassware and silverware were covered in smudges and fingerprints, which is one thing if you're eating at your local East Side's but at a restaurant where the average plate is $35.00-$40.00 or more I would expect clean cutlery and dishes at the very least. When the food came several of us had ordered the New York Striploin and yet no 2 plates looked the same. Some cuts of steak were thick and short, some were thin and long, they were all cooked rare even though they were all requested at different temperatures with one being well done. One of my fellow diners had to send her salmon back twice and it still wasn't cooked thoroughly so she gave up and ate the veggies, that quite frankly tasted frozen. When we told the waitress about the undercooked meals she seemed almost offended and was defensive about the issue and reluctant to take them back. Also I should say when the food was brought back to the kitchen it came back with the meat having been re-heated and the sides all cold.  All in all I would say this restaurant was a terrible waste of money and if it weren't for the good company the evening would have been a write off too. I would not recommend going to Golf Steakhouse because it is significantly over priced and the food, décor and atmosphere seem to have come out of a totally different era.The only reason they are getting 1 star is because you can't select 0 .... But their service here is absolutely HORRIBLE!! 

We sat for 15 minutes with no one coming for our drink order even after going to the bar to ask for a waiter we waited another 5 minutes and all they did was stare at us.. Needless to say we got up and left . Spend your money some where else!I read reviews from yelp about Sugarcane and since we were eating at Sushisamba and offered to check out the place, we thought to try it out.  When we walked inside, it was practically empty (maybe 10 people at most!).  The dance floor was small and there was 1 bar to the corner.  I didn't pay attention the the music, but I know it didn't really impress me and my friends.  There were 2 girls dancing, which tried to liven up the room, but since there was no one really there, we decided to leave.  We were there for maybe 5-10 minutes, and it didn't look like it was going to get any better.  It was already past 11pm so it wasn't a timing issue.  I think that since this place is relatively new and probably not promoted as well, this place still has some time to build up crowd and appeal.The worst club that I've been to my whole entire life. Actually, PURE was the worst, so i guess LAVO gets second place! 

I've been here twice, both bad experiences. The music sucks-- it can't get any worse than that. They play old hip-hop music from the 2000s... like P-Diddy, Mario, etc. WTF?! Where's the recent hit music?! Someone mentioned that the crowd here is ghetto. It is ghetto indeed! 

The drinks suck. It tasted really watery with alcohol.I try to get my boyfriend to try new things. Especially things that I grew up on. But when I take him here, I feel stupid. Because 
1: the girl who made his ice cream put to much in his cup & by the time we had gotten home, his ice cream melted over the edges. 
2: there was a HAIR strand in his ice cream !
3: they do not filter out their toppings so the marshmallows in my ice cream were nice & hard. Gotta love hard marshmallows right? 
I love Cold Stone but I WILL NOT be going back to this one. I have never had such a bad experience with Cold stone before.This place is he absolute worst car wash in the valley! Stay clear! You wait an hour to get your car or truck back dirty! All they do is try and pressure sell you on stuff. They are really bad! You have been warned!!My classmates and I have been to the Mixed Zone Cafe quite a bit because it's close to our school. Half the time the food is good and the other half is so-so. At least until our most recent visit. The dishes we ordered came with fried rice and when we began eating it, instantly realized the rice was spoiled. After the taste came the funky smell. Definitely bad rice. The waitress exchanged the spoiled rice for undercooked white rice. Less than appealing. One of my cohorts asked to cancel the entire order, she did not want to eat food that touched spoiled rice, understandably so. 
She was told to eat it anyway because they were still charging her for the meal, regardless of the quality of the food. Then she was told to take the food home to her kids. When asked if the restaurant would be responsible for hospital bills related to food poisoning, she was told "no" because she wasn't "being forced to anything." WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! And not to mention the HEALTH aspects!
I caution anyone who enters that place to look for a Health Dept grade. Wish we had before eating.This was my first time to a Tilted Kilt and it was awful. I had this image of this chain as hot chicks and descent food. Um...no and no. Nasty meth looking skanks and shitty food. I already felt dirty enough from being on the west side but being at this place made me want to take a bleach bath. Since I dont drive a monster truck with balls or look like I just got back from a sand rail/quad event, I was out of place. I ordered somesort of draft beer and it was delish, but that's not saying much since you can't F that up. I also ordered the calamari and ew! If you like very little squid loaded with grittle then this is your dish. After 20 minutes here I was looking for a way out. If you end up here, all I can say is good luck!I usually go to the #1 Reflexology on Spring Mountain, and I was delighted to learn they had opened another location just around the corner from my home. Since the one on Spring Mountain has always been a favorite of mine despite the fact that it can be hit or miss sometimes, I decided to try the closer location on Flamingo this time. Big mistake. I walked in and discovered I was the only customer there, and the three Asian employees were off in a corner arguing loudly with eachother. I waited a while for them to aknowledge me as I knew they heard the bell chime when I walked in. Nothing. My patience ran out when the thought of spending an hour in that room with the strong smell of freshly microwaved Chinese food overwhelmed me. It was way too overpowering. So- I left after standing at the counter for a couple of minutes with no interaction with anybody. I don't have that high of expectations when I am in Chinatown- I know the weird Asianess comes with the territory like the arguing with eachother in Chinese during your foot massage and the answering of their cell phones... and I'm okay with that- but I was just too tired to deal with it this night. As I got in my car and they realized I had left they came out the door after me but it was too late. I would give them another chance if there isn't a stinky smell of food in there next time.Awful place. The woman that works there has the most awful personality. They bait and switch the customer. I purchased a package for 5 colonic sessions I used only 3 and had 2 remaining. I scheduled my appointment and informed them that I had 2 sessions I was told that that was fine and scheduled the appointment. When I arrived she informed me my package was expired. I was shocked and told her that there was no expiration date on the package. She basically said oh well and said that she would not honor the package or refund the unused portion. I have filed a BBB complaint and have forwarded the email from which I purchased the package to the company. Nowhere does it say there is a time limit in which to use the colonics.  Incidentally they blast religious music without any regard to what you the customer would like to hear, very unprofessional and uncomfortable business.

Response to owners response:
This is just untrue! I never falsified anything!  I put my medical past on the paperwork, that's how she even knew about it!
I did contact the BBB and they have tried many times to contact her with no response from her at all!  It is an open and unresolved investigation against her.   I did have 2 remaining sessions which she took and never refunded the money!  She confirmed over the phone that I had those sessions, that is why I made the appointment and went in there.  Only to be told once I arrived that she decided they were not valid anymore. This is my experience with this business, others have put their experiences in their reviews, clearly at least 2 others rate this business with 1 star.  My mistakes were pre-paying for a package and then being stuck going in there to use the package.We used to consider going to Pan Asia as a treat, one of our "go to" places.  We LOVED the fact that they had a "special" menu on Saturday night that allowed the two of us to eat at least 2 rolls and an order of crab puffs for $20.  It's almost like once they deep 6'd that, the rest of the experience went downhill with it.  But it was still good enough so we were still going.  

Until last week.  We were there about 10 minutes after they opened on Friday and I had to use the restroom.  It stunk like garbage and rotting fish in the bathroom, which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.  

We ordered 3 small salads, 2 rolls (one was cooked), and 1 order of chicken potstickers.  When our water arrived, two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.  When we told the server she made no apology, just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two "new" glasses.  Only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.  The chicken potstickers arrived a good 10 minutes before our rolls did and the server didn't apologize for the wait or let us know when the rolls were almost done.  By this point, I was almost afraid of what would happen once I did eat my sushi roll!  But I did and it was tasty, yet I was still disgusted.  $50 for that horrible experience.  Unfortunately, we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.  Add Pan Asia to the Never Again list!The staff here act put out whenever a customer walks through the door. The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.  It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.I won't go back to this restaurant.  The food literally made me ill.

It is clean, the decor is good, and the service can't be faulted.  However, I spent all night in the bathroom losing the meal I had there.  How do I know their food caused it? I had a bowl of cereal that morning.  What I lost that was undigested was my meal from True Food's, a clear sign of food poisoning.  I had the teryaki tofu.  My neighbor had salmon and was fine.

I plan to call them tomorrow and notify them of what happened.  

My general opinion of the place if I hadn't become ill.  It is a trendy place with an interesting menu. The service was good-I had no complaints.   It was clean and the deco handsome and low key.  I found it  disconcerting that neither of us could easily read the menu due to the dim lights.  I noticed the gentleman at the next table tipping his menu to catch more light while he was trying to read it.  How long it will stay a gathering place for the for the more socially inclined, I question.   Both of us thought for the most part the items on the menu were overpriced.  The restaurant is located at the Biltmore  so I expected the prices to be at least a bit high anyway and they were.   

We did have to get a steak knife for my friend to be able to cut the bread her salmon was on. The restrooms were interesting with unique dryers that actually did a complete job of drying the hands.

Added 1/29-I decided to email Sam Fox instead of calling.  No reply as yet.
2/2-It is now the day after the Super Bowl and still no response.   That tells me something about the owner, Sam Fox, and his attitude. When I sent him a compliment on another of his restaurants, I got almost an immediate response.  Not this time!  5/27/09-never heard back.  Negative one star for this one.Dieses Hotel hält meinen persönlichen Europarekord in der Sparte Schlechtestes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis! Im einzelnen: 1) Der Empfang, der von uns um 12 Uhr mittags mit dem Wunsch die Zimmer beziehen zu wollen, offenbar völlig aus der Bahn geworfen wurde (wir hatten bei der HRS-Buchung Frühanreise angegeben). Zimmer gäbe es grundsätzlich nicht vor 14 Uhr, aber wir könnten uns ja erst mal zum Lunch begeben, um die Wartezeit auszunutzen. Nach Diskussion mit einer hochnäsigen Angestellten wurde uns wenigstens gestattet, die Koffer in einem unverschlossenen Zimmer in einem Nebenflur abzustellen. 2.) Nach einem Spaziergang in der näheren Umgebung und Erkundung des schönen und gepflegten Gartenbereichs, war es mit Bezug der sehr kleinen Zimmer mit schön und gepflegt vorbei. Die Fenster waren undicht mit blätternder Farbe an den Rahmen, die Raumluft trotz der Undichtigkeit muffig, der Teppich fleckig und die Einrichtung recht veraltet. Der Hammer im Zimmer: Die beiden Nachttischlampen waren ohne Glühbirnen!!! Im winzigen Bad dann Rostansätze am Duschkopf und mehr Kalkablagerungen als in einer durchschnittlichen Tropfsteinhöhle. Zum Glück war man nach einem erlebnisreichen und langen Tag im wirklich sehenswerten Edinburgh so müde, dass man unter Verwendung von Ohropax trotz der Hellhörigkeit der Zimmer schlafen konnte. Eine knallende Feuerschutztür auf dem Flur hätte sonst auch das noch verhindert. 3) Sehr im Kontrast dazu die gemütliche Hotelbar am Abend und das immerhin befriedigende Frühstück am Morgen (mit genießbarem Kaffee!). Aber das konnte es nicht mehr wettmachen. Nach einem gelangweilt durchgeführtem Check-Out waren wir froh dieses Hotel nach 2 Tagen für umgerechnet ca. 130 EUR pro Nacht und Zimmer für alle Zeiten hinter uns zu lassen.I am very disappointed to here that the mini corn dogs are not on the menu anymore. These were one of the items that I came here for.  They are excellent. I would order them everytime I came in. They've been replaced by spinach and artichoke dip, not an item that should be served by a burger joint. Yuck!! Whynot add fried mac and cheese. Don't know what's going on with menu. Lbs burger is still a place to try. You'll always get great service here.Just got a text message cancelling 37 minutes after they were supposed to be here AND after being called last week and having to reschedule because KC had a "family emergency". No problem, I understand...that happens, but as I needed to have them done by a certain day, I agreed they could come at 8:00 a.m. on a holiday even though it wasn't something I would have preferred but they said they would do it. Then Vince sent the text (not a call) saying he had tried to call me several times the night before which isn't true because I had my cell phone on me. Now I have to figure out how to get my coupon money back from Yelp...I would stay away!Food was disgusting. Chips were stale. Ordered nachos and quesidillas for happy hour - both were very bland and you don't get much. The drinks are overpriced, even at happy hour. I will never eat here again.I'm seriously baffled by all of the positive reviews Lan Thai has got. Maybe I just ordered on a bad night, but I may never know as I shan't be going back.

I'd been travelling back from business in Belfast, all I'd eaten was a muffin at 8am. I didn't get home until about 9pm so I was super hungry, so my other half and I decided to order in. Unfortunately we chose to order from Lan Thai 

We didn't receive the crackers we were supposed to get for our order over £16, and the takeaway boxes were broken. No big deal, accidents happen. But the food.. urgh. I ate about two bites and was done. The massaman curry is a few bits of chicken and peanuts floating around in some orange water. The Pad Thai tastes like someone has poured lemon washing up liquid in it.

It was absolutely appalling, disgusting... urgh. Seriously, please don't order from here. You'll regret it.Stepping into the Victoria Bar is like stepping back into time - a traditional pub, mostly full of old men drinking pints and muttering in low voices about the football scores in the dark.

The pub itself isnt bad, a standard pub decor and decent in size with the bar against the far wall as you enter - however, during my (very swift) pint, the staff were rude, and sounded throughly bored with serving anybody ever again. The Victoria Bar, does however, sell a large range of ales - possibly its only redeeming feature.

Needless to say, this isnt my type of bar - i felt massivly out of place, and what was worse, I knew it just as well as all of the regulars.Unfortunately, this was the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls and other pieces were edible, but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable, and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent, it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner). wow.Since we always come here for happy hour, I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um, yeah, there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder, burgers, and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing.I came in because the chalkboard on the wall said "$1 Coronas" and it is 107 out today. Sounded like a good way to cool off.

Went in. Only person there. Ordered a corona. Waited about 2 min for them to give it too me. I ordered the beer & it took the guy 2 min to get me a beer & lime slice in the middle of the day when I'm the ONLY customer AND I'm sitting AT THE BAR where I can almost reach them myself!?!?!?

I get the beer and they tell me it's $4. I'm like "What about the sign outside?"
Him - "Oh that's just for ladies. Sunday is ladies special."
Fine. Whatever. I paid because I was a hot & bit hung over and a cold beer was sitting right in front of me.

I ordered some hummus w/chicken  & bread because it was 1/2 off.
There was only 1 piece of pita cut up and arranged to make it look like there was more. There was a fair amount of hummus but it was the worst I've ever had. If they made "instant hummus" that came in a powder where you could just mix with water then this would have been the generic wal-mart brand of that
It still cost $5 when it was 1/2 price so that means normally they charge $10 for it. Rape.

I was still thirsty and they had Jager-bombs on "Special" for $5 (not much of a special IMO) and I ordered one for the "wings" I hoped it would give me.
They brought out a jager & red-bull mixed in a glass.
To clarify for those of you that don't know a Jager-bomb, by definition, is Jager in a shot glass dropped into a glass of energy drink.
A Jager-Red-bull is the two mixed in a glass.
It changes the taste and is a DIFFERENT drink even in bartender guides.

Then they wanted to ARGUE with me about what a Jager-Bomber was because apparently the customer is NEVER right to these guys. The argument was over when I pulled up www.Jagermeister.com on my laptop and showed them the official definition of a Jager-Bomber according to the manufacturer of the liquor..

It was also noisy. I like music or TV or w/e in most places but they had a radio AND TVs up loud and the mix of the two was just an annoying noise. 

I complained to the manager and he gave me a few of their businesses cards that I could use for $1 Millerl Lites like it was something special to make up for everything. (There were also a stack of these cards I noticed on my way out that ANYONE could grab) Basically treating me like I'm retarded and brushing off my complaint without really doing anything to fix it.

I will never be back here. I wish it was still the Philly cheese-steak shop that it used to be years ago.

I'm sitting in here on their free wi-fi as I write this.
It's almost like shooting someone with their own gun.Service & Food here NOT GOOD!
(and that's an understatement)

The very few times I have been here the employees don't seem to speak very clear english. I have to repeat myself several times before my order is understood. Then the people behind the counter are rude, they don't seem to care about being polite, and have a "getto" type of attitude with customers. Instead of "Welcome" or " how can I help you" it's "whaddu want" or " what u geddin?" If you ask about anything other than what is on the board like TV specials or special items - they have NO clue what you are talking about, and will stand their and look puzzled, then they will just tell you NO. 

Worse Panda Express experience ever.. I will not go back to this location, I will go to the other location in Chandler.... 

Word to the Manager - Teach your Employees that Customers Service is #1 Priority.. Maybe even have them smile once in awhile, and say "hello" and "thank you sir/ma'am" would be nice...instead of the "getto-fab" attitude.MARCOS CHAIDEZ IRRESPONSABLE HAIRDRESSER, DESTROYED MY HAIR 

I called the Platinum Hair Studio to make an appointment for retouch my highlights, do hydration and cute the ends, I asked the secretary who was the best professional specialized on highlights and she booked me with MARCOS CHAIDEZ.

My appointment was for the end of February, I met MARCOS CHAIDEZ and asked him to follow the same pattern of highlight I had, it was Blonde stripes, nothing complicated to do, anyway he made me look very Blonde, he made tiny highlights with not the streaks separation I had,  the Blonde was all blended with my dark hair. I didn't liked but I was in a hurry, I didn't want spend more 2h there... When I got home I texted him to say that, and he said would be better to wait to get it fixed the way I wanted the next month to give time for my hair.

I made an appointment with him for Thus April 12, before a whole month business trip in Europe. I had to leave on Monday 16 to attend a Fitness expo in Germany( I'm a fitness model)
I arrived at the salon in the time scheduled and I explained to Marcos that was better he just follow the same pattern he did in instead of try to make my hair look as it was before he touched.

I also asked him to not bleach where was already bleached to not damage, better only retouch the roots and in instead of start retouch from the back to start from the front because the hair in the back was sensitive already.

He did start from the front, and because the aluminum foil was covering my eyes I was not really able to see what exactly he was doing, he left it over 15 min and put me in the dryer for more 10 min then washed my hair with shampoo and I felt that after the shampoo he said he will do a deep hydratation but I think he put more bleach because my scalp start to was burn a little, I start to be worried and aks him what was that he putting in my head, he repeated was a deep hydration, anyway I was not able to tell because my head was laid back in the place where they wash the hair.

Then he rinsed what I think was bleach and put conditioner over it and rinsed again, then brought me to blow dry and ironed my hair, all the time he was drying my hair and ironing he turned my head against the mirror so I couldn't really see how it looks, I saw only at the end and I noticed it was really dark on the sides and very light platinum blonde in the front. Again I left not so happy because once again he didn't follow my requests, but again I was in a hurry due all my preparation for my travel I wouldn't be able to lose any more time there and I didn't want to.

When I left the salon the hair looked ok because he sprayed a lot of products before I left and it last straight and like normal until I washed it on Sunday.
When I washed my hair it started to curl and break, I had pieces of my hair in my hands... I dried it with blow dry in a low temperature to try to take of all the frizz but didn't worked.

My hair never look so bad and damaged in my whole life.

I texted MARCOS CHAIDEZ to tell him what he done to my hair but I'm sure he knew what he done to my hair already when I left the salon that day.
He never answered me my texts or phone call.

I noticed that he tried to cover the excess of bleach dying it black what make it even worst, right now my hair looks all brittle in the top very short because it all broke and the blond with some black spots, it look really bad. 

I totally rely in my image because of my work, I was desperate with my hair that way, having to attend the expo in Europe and with a bunch of photo shoots scheduled...

I went in a famous hair salon in Europe, when the hairdresser looked my hair he was in shock. The only solution he found was use a non permanent dark color( permanent would damage it even more) to cover all the ugly Blonde Greysh color and left only the front highlights, and a week later I went back for a treatment. And buy a half wig to wear until my hair grows back in the spots Marcos destroyed.
I had to spend couple hundred Euros to cover up all his irresponsibility and lack or professionalism. I feeling very depress, I had a gorgeous hair.

I writing this detailed review because I don't want anyone face a situation like I having right nowIf I could give 0 stars I would.... Absolute worst sushi and calamari I have ever had! The calamari was rubbery and tasted like they bought it frozen from Costco. I could have bought better sushi from smiths or vons. Service was great, they understood my dissappointment. Sapporo was superb!dirty, too many flies, the staff does not wear gloves, it is gross, and the food is awful,
and, not good, the utensils are never clean, tables are dirty all the time, flies everywhere.  IT IS THE WORST PLACE TO EAT.This Circle K is awful. I was out for a walk in my neighborhood. I am a yuppie--white, ivy leaguer, graduate school background, high income, etc.--and I briefly paused outside the door of the Circle K to open a lemonade and have a taste prior to beginning my walk home. 

Though I'd been standing there about 30 seconds, some fat, bald security guard sauntered over and said that I was not allowed 'to loiter there' on the property. You don't need to be a lawyer to recognize that having completed a sale with Circle K and not staying beyond the standard time of consumption of the item, this was not loitering.

In the same intervention, Fat Boy also asked a nearby homeless that he too should leave the Circle K. Clearly, that was appropriate because this man was not a customer.

If Fat Boy is the only line of civilization that stands between the gentrifying yuppies of downtown Phoenix, and the vagrant garbage that stream outward from their nest at the Westward Ho, I weep for the future of our city.Riverview Toyota was WAY overpriced ..out of 5 dealerships they were the most expensive .. I purchased mine at Tempe Toyota for almost four thousand dollars less then Riverview wanted. I also found that the service department is much friendlier at Tempe toyota than at Riverview Toyota.. Then when I want to purchase my Scion I had the same experience the most expensive and the least friendly salesperson. Ended up buying my Scion at Tempe Scion.This place sucks. My girlfriend had her phone stolen here right off our table. Great security guys... Not really what you expect when you're paying $500We were going to try Olive's last night but found they have gone out of business.they had big groups of buisiness man it was laud and food was all messed up I complained to waiter he got attitude they charged full price all 4 meal was nasty I returned my fish dish but they did not do anything. NEVER GO BACK THE PLACE EVER!!!!!!!If I could give a zero I would! I've been going to this place off and on for years until I finally started seeing a nail tech that did a decent job. 

The nail tech I would see would blatantly  ask if I could pay her  tip in cash because the owner would take forever to give them the their tips. On another occasion I asked if she could give me a backfill but she told me she wanted to leave early for a trip and instead did the white gel that only lasted 3 days!! You would think I would learn my lesson but continued to go because I'm not familiar with other nail shops. 

Well... I went two weeks ago for a fill and a week later noticed that my nail hurt and looked green and puffy!!! Yup infection!!! I went to the doctors and was told it was infection from DIRTY TOOLS!!!! Do not go there!!! I've filled out in a formal complaint with the board. SAVE YOUR NAILS DONT GO HERE!This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!

They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.  

The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.  

Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!this review comes some two years after the fact but was reminded of my craptastic experience by fellow yelper jay d! (thank you jay!)

this story is of a bay area girl going to vegas with her then boyfriend for a weekend of import drag races. sounds fun right?! so we decided it would be fun for us to do a road trip to vegas. my then bf was a bit of a procrastinator and could only find us a room at the poopicana..oops i mean the tropicana. i mean he could have gotten rooms at a nicer place but he also doubled as a cheap ass! :D (that is my shit talking shit eating grin.)

story continues with us arriving into vegas before our room was ready. no biggie... lunch and then check in. we finally get to check in and we are EXHAUSTED! plan is to sleep for a couple of hours then head out. lucky for us (sarcasm) our room was on the first floor located right next to the entrance of the casino. drunk people are practically standing on our little patio drunk, yelling on the phone and smoking! this did not sit well with the bf, so he called and got our room changed. 

to the next room we went. 
me: "this room is kind of hot"
bf: "i'll turn on the ac"
me: *standing next to vent* "i don't feel shit."

turns out it was broken. i called the front desk and they get their maintenance man on the scene. hours later he shows up. he does what i like to call "jack shit". the room remains hot. did i mention that vegas was in a heat wave on this particular weekend in july. i mean it's only like 130ish outside. we decide to tough it out. bad idea. bf gets drunk that night. when we got back the room was like a sauna. bf gets drunker.

next morning i can't take the 85 degree hotel room and i get us switched, YET AGAIN! we walk into our third and final room for our two night stay in vegas. it was dark but i could feel the breeze of the ac rustle through my hair! bf walks in first, i follow....

bf: "ummmmm...."
me: "are those mirrors on the ceiling?!?!?!?"
bf" "and on the walls?"
me: "is there any spot in this room that doesn't have mirror on it? OMIGOD babe we're in a '70s porn room!"
bf: "i didn't think these existed anymore?!"
me: *jumps on bed* "this could be kind of cool?!"
bf: *jumps on bed*
me: *laying on bed looking up to the ceiling* "ya... this isn't as cool as i thought it would be. the lights are staying off tonight"

it wasn't a urine soaked room like jay.. but it's probably a good thing i didn't have a black light for that last room... then i probably would have seen cum stains all over the walls! **GAG** that was the last time i stayed in a hotel on the strip! thank god for friends who live in or have vacation houses in vegas!!My roommate (who is disabled) and I stayed at this hotel for Christmas, and it was the worst experience ever. 

(1) The hotel room (paradise tower room) was filthy and did not look like the floor was vacuumed at all. There was a jelly bean, hair, papers on the floor and a big stain on the carpet. And the table in the room was so wobbly.

(2) They gave out a coupon for lobster meal for a new customer. We asked the guy at the information booth where the restaurant was, and he told us that restaurant was under renovation so we could not use the coupons. So we had to go to the other hotel and spent over $100 for lobster dinner while we could have only spent only $50 with coupons at Tropicana. Then later we found out that we could have used the coupon at the different restaurant located in Tropicana, and the guy gave us wrong information was not even an employee for the hotel.

(3) It said we get free tickets for Hypnosis show by booking a room at Tropicana, so we planned on going, but they canceled the show at last minute. We could not see the show on different night because we already planned to go to a different show.

(4) My roommate is disabled and has a help dog (with proper paperwork). We called in advance to let them know that we would bring a dog, and also informed at the front desk and security when cheking in, and they said no problem. But when Orbitz called the hotel regaring our complaints, they lied that we brought a dog even though animals were not allowed.  

(5) The food at the buffet was terrible, by far one of the most disgusting food we ever tasted in our lives. Bread and food was so dry and tasted like cardboard and water tasted like chlorine. We got sick from eating.

I will NEVER EVER go back to this hotel even after renovation and NEVER recommend this hotel for anyone!! (The only good thing I can think of about this hotel is the location)
If you want to save money, stay at Motel 6 instead (which is about a block away from the strip) and I'm sure it's much better than the filthy room and lousy service at Tropicana. Or pay a little extra to stay at different casino hotels.I love the gorgeous photo on their billboard of their newly renovated rooms. Too bad we weren't in them. 

If you're not in the updated rooms, this place is a shithole. I mean, seriously. Our room's wallpaper was peeling, the carpets were stained and dirty, the bed looked dingy, and worst of all, in the 100 degree heat (at 11pm!) of Las Vegas, the puttering air conditioning was just insulting - I'm fairly certain it never got below 80 degrees the entire time we were in the room. 

It's not even like "Well, at least we're not at the Motel 6." It's like "Holy shit, I wish we had stopped at that Roadkill Inn a few miles back!" 

Our room was $45 on a special. On arriving in the room, I immediately went to the Kayak app on my iPhone 4 (it saves lives), and looked for hotel deals in the vicinity. Rio was $55. BOOM, done. Booked that thing and checked the F outta Tropicana. 

I will say this: we called and asked for new rooms before hitting the "accept" button to reserve the the Rio, but Tropicana said "if it was any other night we could, but not tonight." So, when we checked out about 1.5 hours after checking-in, they told us they'd refund what we paid to Expedia because they couldn't move us to new rooms. The only upside to this adventure was that we didn't have to pay for it.No no no! Our first day/night our a/c wasn't working and so it was hot. Then every night we stayed there including the first, when we pulled back, what was supposed to be, clean bed sheets we found hair! And not any hair, pubic hair! Omg...*gag*...there were like 4 or 5 of them! Also the sheets had these yellowish stains from overuse. It was disgusting. And to make matters worse my boyfriend kept breaking out in hives in the morning! When we finally checked out I talked to the guy behind the counter who said all he could do was return the resort's fees. I may end up contacting Hotwire and see about getting a refund. Ugh. Never again with this place!One of the oldest casino on the strip and it looks it.  Sure they modified and revamped it, but it just doesn't compared to the other casinos and it still feels dated. Not as many table games and the slots are not new.  Even though it's on a corner with 3 other large casinos and has a bridge to access them, they seem to be be far away.  Perhaps because the other casinos bridge goes directly into the casinos where the Tropicana still requires walking to get to there place.  I think they need to tear down the place because the modifications still didn't do enough for me to want to come back.Blech....the food is nasty, everything tastes like something other than what it is and the old people, my God, the old people. I should expect no less since we live so close to Sun City; but for the love of God they are everywhere!! Maybe because the food was so bad that the old people only added to my total dissatisfaction. I will admit that I have a general aversion to buffets  because they kind of gross me out anyway. Most of the time the food is not good, nor good for you and generally the restaurants are filthy-- food on the floor from the toddler before you or the bus persons who just clear the table onto the floor and don't even clean off the condiments that are on the tables-- eeewwwww. So take this review for what it is worth and dine at your own risk.My friends and I wanted to try this place since we pass by it so often.  One Friday, we decided to try it out for dinner.  When we arrived we were told there was a 30 min wait.  As we waited, we noticed that all the tables that would normally seat 4-6 people, only had 2 people seated.  There were 2 tables available that could seat 2 (we were a party of 4).  

Our wait took longer than 30 minutes, so we decided to sit for Teppanyaki.  This took an additional 30 minutes and when we asked the hostess when it would be our table's turn for the Chef, she said it would be another 50 minutes.  (There were 6 Teppan tables and 2 chefs on a Friday night!)

Needless to say, we left and ate at the Chinese restaurant across the way.  

I don't know if their service this particularly night was out of the norm, but I would prepare would a long wait if you decide to eat here.A favorite among the university crowd. I'm not a fan. I've been here multiple times and this time I decided to write a review.

I'd gotten the "Healthy Life." It didn't seem all that healthy to me. Not really sure what I paid for was actually worth my money, it seemed quite plain and simple. And the tomatoes they'd been using were terrible. On top of that, I'd ordered orange juice. Expecting freshly squeezed orange juice, I drink a "from concentrate" glass of Oasis orange juice which I'd seen the waitress pouring for us. No. Just no. And charging us $3 for it? Nah b.

Other times I've gone, it seemed alright. A typical 60's diner setting. If you're actually considering weekend brunch at Mel's, you might to consider coming early, to avoid the rush. Other than that, the place itself isn't all that fantastic. In comparison to other places in the proximity, this place is alright. I'd only go here if I'm in absolute need of greasy food.THE WORST place for those of us who are gluten intolerant! I JUST went to this particular restaurant with a group of about 15 people who saw a movie at the theatre next door first. I immediately asked my waiter about gluten-free items and he brought me a notebook that is a complete joke for a customer with dietary needs. CREATE A GLUTEN FREE MENU like everyone has! He was nice, however I had a few questions and he told me the manager would come over to help me. Every single person was served their meal, ate, received their bills and STILL no manager to help me. I had decaf coffee ~ which I paid for. NEVER AGAIN at this restaurant!!!DO NOT EAT HERE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!! From management all the way down to the host.....Just plain BAD SERVICE! Now let me tell you about the food. The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now.

"When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant" -eHowI have been going to Turf for years.  They recently changed management and the menu (twice now, actually).  The fish and chips used to be great--some of my favorite in the central Phoenix area.  Boy, are the F & C's lousy now---greasy, heavy breading and flavorless.  The hamburgers have good meat but also flavorless.  They got rid of the bacon and chocolate they had when they revised the menu the 1st time.  Booooo.  Everything is better with bacon!  And they got rid of my pub favorite: the steak sandwich.  The chicken wings are ridiculously huge and, again, not that great.  Plus no more steak fries, which my friend really liked.  The HH food menu is lacking and was really perturbed when I went there and they had no guacamole (a HH menu item).  The service has also gone downhill.  Husband waited 30 minutes for his flavorless hamburger.  The ONLY improvement is their wine selection got better. I will avoid eating here (will eat before I get there) in the future until they hopefully make some positive changes.  Please bring back some of the old menu items!  And go back to your old fish and chip recipe.Here's what $152 a night got us... no coffee maker, no extra bed linens for the sofa bed, a mini fridge that apparently works on a timer because it wasn't on when we woke up and all our food was warm, no plates or utensils in the kitchen, no robes, no dvd player. The look of the hotel is beautiful but the virtual tour online is not the same as the room we got, which was a lot smaller. Totally disappointing stay. I won't be back for this kind of $.
This is an update to my comments above: the reason that we don't have a coffee maker in the room is that the rooms don't come with them. I mean, even motel 8 has coffee makers! AND in order to have maid service, you have to give 24 hours notice and pay an extra $45. That would have been good to know BEFORE 4pm the day before we checked out.We decided to go with Vdara since their pool and the rooms looked nice, and we needed a place to relax after our week long road trip. I wanted to try out one of the city center places and, Aria didnt have suites

I have to say, the room was pretty nice.

The reasons I am forced to give such a poor review, which I rarely do...

1) We checked in at around 5PM; 20 minutes later someone opens the door and walks in, didnt even knock.. she comes in and looks at something and said she just wanted to look at the room map or something like that! .. for real? what if I was naked? or worse doing something else? 

2) The place has only valet.. which sounded nice at first, but if you forget something in the car, there is no way to go get it.. and of course you have to go downstairs and wait for your car..
3) No coffee machines in the room? After floating in beer all day/night till 5Am, last thing I want to do is dress up and walk around looking for coffee when I get up. .
4) So I finally force myself to shower and leave the place; I switch on the "please clean room" light and leave for the day.. get back at 4PM.. the room is still not clean.. So i had to call the service desk and ask for someone to clean it.
3) Since the lady was cleaning the roomwe go to the pool.. but when we get there, the pool is closed ! at 410PM!!! are you serious? they closed the pool at 4PM...
And that was the whole reason we booked a room at this place..


4) But the worst of all this is, even though it looks like its right next to the strip, its hard to get to from the strip. Mainly because they dont have directions anywhere , even inside Aria, and since they dont have a casino or any restaurants in Vdara, you are forced to go looking for places.. 

Overall, even though the rooms are super cool, staying here was a very painful experience. I give it only one star, and I will NEVER stay here again.. 

Now I know why I love Venetian !!  cant wait to go back there..In addition to my bad review for Kaya, a shocking discovery was made when I checked out my bank statement. Kaya was not only slow during our lunch hour visit, forgotten an item, served frozen lemons with our waters, they actually managed to charge twice on my credit card and didn't charge my friend's credit card. Seriously!!?? How confusing is a Wells Fargo credit card versus a Bank of America Credit card!! She had 3 tables in the whole restaurant, during our meal (should I even call it a meal?). Apparently to the Kaya server, it is as confusing as black and white.  Willful stupidity absolutely makes me livid!

So, I phoned the manager and asked to be credited ASAP. She talked me into coming down and accepting cash for the duplicate charge.  After patiently waiting for 15 minutes inside the restaurant, I began feeling strangulated because of strong emotion that reminded me of my horrible eating experience! 

Additionally, the manager had the nerve to ask for my friend's contact information so she can properly charge him on his credit card! The frozen lemons, welted vegetables and rancid sushi must have gotten to her crazy head!  Gracefully grabbing my cash from her hand, my look of despair and silence concluded her query!! 

One great thing out of this is that my out of town friend had a free horrible lunch which I don't mind paying for....EgAVOID THIS PLACE!!!  It was one of the worst pizzas ever.  I went here for the first time, because of a coupon deal... but I will never be a return customer at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria.

I should've known from the start when I called in my order and the young guy working there kept me on hold for quite a few minutes, before he rushed through my order and didn't even ask for my name.  He just hung up and had a careless attitude.  When I picked up the pizza, I saw the place was a dump... the booths are falling apart and it looks very run down.  It's gross to think they serve food in a place like this  :/

But the icing on the cake was the ***BURNED BLACK*** pizza that I received.  In all the times my family has ordered take-out pizza, we've NEVER had one that was so badly burned.  It was inedible!!  To make it worse, the young guy working there didn't think it was a problem-- he thought it looked fine!  That's the kind of employees this place has!  It's terrible service and even worse food.... avoid it.Horrible experience.  Went there with my father over Labor Day.  When we arrived the line was very long, but moving so we decided to get in.  At first the line crept along, but at least it moved.  Then it slowed down. Then it slowed down to a stop.  We had already paid so we were stuck.  We saw MANY open tables and numerous hostesses talking amougnst themselves about what to do, but not actually doing anything like actually seating the customers.  It took over 1 1/2 hours from getting in line to getting to our table.  And remember there were many, many open tables so there was more than enough seating.  Just not enough customer service.  No food, especially at an expensive buffet such as this, is worth that wait.  Will never go back.Utterly terrible on a Friday night.Should have read reviews on this place about BAD customer service. Pedi was okay for $21+$5 for the acid scrub, but the full-set experience was HORRID. Should have known they do crap work when I walked in at 6:55 and they said they would take me even though they close at 7. The place still had customers and more ladies walked in AFTER me, and of course they were taken also. Man at the front yells for two ladies to come help me. One lady does my toes: pleasantly surprised that they use a plastic foot bath lining for the pedicure, she doesn't say a word to me which is fine, but I ask her if I can pay extra for a gel coat on my toes to last longer and apparently she had no clue what I was talking about because she didn't do it, massage chair was whack and the lady doing my full-set asked me to turn it off. She also doesn't say a word to me which again I'm okay with, but by the time she brings over the UV nail dryer I'm thinking there's NO WAY she's done. I look at my CROOKED nails and I ask her if she is still going to shape my nails... obviously she didn't understand because she uttered a "yeah" and stuck my hand, crooked nails and all, in the dryer! She finishes my other hand and takes off to start another lady's nails. I'm clearly looking at my nails in DISGUST because they are shaped as if diagonally shaped nails are OKAY. THE OWNER/GUY AT THE FRONT sits down because I have an obviously HORRIFIED look on my face and he looks at my hands. I tell him they do not look good at all, he takes my hand and says they are not straight (at least he sees it!) and says he'll fix them... he files away as I try to go back to relaxing in the useless massage chair, still having my pedi/french-tip done. He finishes one had and starts to file the other side while I stare at the horrible job HE DID. He kept asking me, "is that better?" and I almost cried because it was obvious he was in a hurry, doing a crap, and my nails were not going to look good. Maybe it's because of my profession that I held back everything I was going to say, but I just jumped up, paid, and darted out of there. I LATER REALIZED THERE IS NO POLISH ON MY THUMBS - I paid an extra $5 for a gel coat and got 8/10 nails???? And crooked ones, at that?!There is a reason that on Friday nights the "seafood" buffet is only $14.50.  Pacific Coast seafood buffet is about the same price and is far better with way more options. I'd don't really have much in the way of positives to say about this place.

Wait, my server was pleasant and enjoyable.

Now, first off, I would never bring my child to this place to eat.  This has to be the smokiest establishment in metro Phx.  Even though the restaurant is nonsmoking, the casino's smoke proliferates into every available pocket of space!  At the end of your dinner, when you get to your car and open your purse to get your keys, smoke will billow from it.  

Now, on to the food...  You walk into the establishment and pay for the buffet much like u would at any casino buffet.  You leave your tip at this point too. Not an issue for me, but what disgusted me was the cashier tried to short my server on the amount of the tip that I left!  I kept telling her she wrote the wrong amount on the slip and the cashier kept pretending to not understand me.  But I've waited on a few tables in the college days, so we got that fixed.

So the seating area is approaching Dive-ey.  But looked clean.  They have an "overflow" room that people can sit in if the main dining room is full. 

The most disappointing part about RRB was the food.  I can deal with a shady cashier, dive-ey atmosphere, but bad food is not an option when I have driven 30 + mins to get to you!  The buffet bar is relatively small with salad options - green mix, romaine and Caesar.  There are the regular Salad bar staples.  They do have a lady who makes a great pepperchini and feta mix from scratch that taste great.  The hot bar has mashed potatoes and rice.  There is "prime riib" swimming in warm juice and over-cooking it.   There was stuffed cabbage that taste like u can imagine stuffed cabbage tasting like.  Oh, yeah, I'm forgetting something, the seafood... Crab legs and fried shrimp.  

Suffice it to say, I will most likely will never return.Went there this morning and service was super slow! It took 30 minutes for one breakfast sandwich and the order was wrong.  The manager Barbara seemed like she had NO clue what was going on.This is probably the worst buffet I have ever had.  And vegas is renowned for buffets.  What a disappointment.I really hate to do this, and I will be happy to edit my review if somebody from this DD can tell me WHY
EVERY time I have gone to the drive-thru, they screw up my order? First the walkie talkie thing was broken so you had to sit there and yell for 5 min to get someone to ask for the order.
Then they took half an hour and they never had any donuts early in the morning.  Okay okay I said. They just opened up! Give them a break.

Well guess what. I pay 6 or 7 bucks on Saturdays and Sundays and EVERY time, they give me a freaking egg/cheese english muffin with HAM.  I don't ask for any ham on it.  It is ON the menu without ham. Why, why, whyyyyyy do you put ham on it?  One day I sent it back and all they did was take the damn ham off it.  Yes they did.  

Plus all the times I get to work ready to eat and I remember that I shouldn't have left that window without checking.... but there it is. HAM on my freaking sandwich! 

I made a complaint online.  Nobody ever got back to me, they don't give a crap.  Only reason I go there now is for the hash brown bites, which are a little bite of heaven!I bought a Groupon for this place because my regular hairstylist's dad was real sick. 
I was ten minutes late for my appointment which I called to give them a heads up about. When I got there the receptionist said the stylist had just run to Starbucks. 
When she walked in, she said, "Is this it?" (Meaning her appointment) and the receptionist said yes. First of all, THIS???  Is this it?  Um, I'm a human being thanks. 
Then, she never introduced herself, I still don't know her name, and she wasn't very chatty at all like I'm used to hairstylists usually being. She made it sound like my ten minutes was a HUGE inconvenience for her. I finally had to break the ice and start talking to her which she did talk to me, but still didn't really engage. 
The salon itself is really nice. Their hair washing stations are super comfortable and don't hurt your neck at all. Oh but did I mention she washed my hair with cold water? Brr!!  I won't go back.My husband and I just got back from seeing Viva Elvis and wondering where I should start.  Simply put, don't go to this show.  The best way I can describe it is as a glorified cruise ship production - nothing about this show says Cirque du Soleil.  From the get go, we know it was going to be bad.  The "blue suede shoe" was purple, the acrobats were out of sync, the curtain got stuck open so the show had to be stalled,  the mc's mic did not always work, etc.  We even saw some people walking out of the show mid-way through.  At the end, when the performers tried to get everyone to stand up and cheer, the majority of the theater sat still and barely clapped.  The only redeeming part of the show was the amazing video footage and photos of Elvis.  We paid $130 per ticket (which is 25% off the normal price) and were completely disappointed.  If you are looking for a Cirque show in Vegas, steer clear of this one.  Go to Love!  Now that is a great show honoring other musical legends.  Sadly, the King did not keep up with the Beatles.Was so looking forward to this place, but it towtally let me down. It was a busy evening and we got sat within minutes. However, we sat and sat.... We noticed a table next to us and they looked unhappy waiting too. We finally left after 15 minutes of waiting.
So, we decided to try their quick order window and another let down. Over-priced, salty hot dogs with dry buns. The dessert, what I was excited about, frozen hot chocolate. Yup, another let down. No one wanted to finish an over-priced sugary drink. Boo hoo Serendipity3!On my recent trip to Vegas I was so excited to eat at this restaurant but my excitement quickly dissipated into dissapointment as we were greeted by a very unhelpful and rude hostess. She was not friendly nor helpful. (Ex: when we asked if we could get a menu to look over while we waited, she pointed to the wall and said "this is our menu").  People that came after us were seated before us and when we finally got a table our waitress was also rude and unfriendly. (Ex: When she brought my friend her tea we commented on how cute the tea pot was and she snapped back "it's hot, don't touch it!").  Needless to say we asked for the check shortly after that! For me, the service is just as (if not more) important than the quality of food for a restaurant to be successful. I was so turned off by the staff personal that I wasn't willing to sit through an entire meal. If you do decide to try this place, I hope you have a better experience! ( But if your experience turns south there is a great Italian restaurant in cesars palace called Raos that has great food and staff! (That's were we ended up eating!) Good luck to all!!We wanted to go the restaurant, but the wait was 30 minutes and all we wanted to do was to try the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  So I appreciate that they had a "Fun on the run menu" which is basically a way to grab something quick. The service was definitely faster, our drink was ready right after we paid!
Half star because the place was pink and cute. Half star because it tasted good. Minus four stars because the price was ridiculous and this place is seriously over-rated! 

$10- Frozen Hot Chocolate: For taste, I thought this was chocolate goodness. However, my friend says it tasted like his protein powder mixture.

$11- Mochacino Coffee Frozen Hot Chocolate:  This was pretty tasty.  The mocha was rich in flavor and blended well with the chocolate.  I liked the espresso chocolate on top.  Although it was delicious, the Costco's version of Mocha Latte comes pretty close.


Would you pay $12 (after tax) for a regular size (16 oz. maybe) of iced hot chocolate topped with whipped cream?  Why do you call it Frozen hot chocolate when it wasn't even frozen or icy?A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on "The List"?  Yeah, no thanks. I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff online.

If you do decide to bother with this place, call ahead. Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale.  While calling, also ask how to get put on "The List", because that info isn't on their site either.**The comment by 24 hour fitness staff on this review was kind but the staff member failed to follow through. I haven't heard back from him or anyone at 24 hour fitness (but I have received numerous annoying text message and phone call marketing contacts).***

I was really disappointed with my experience at this particular 24 Hour Fitness Location this afternoon. When I arrived I was greeted by smiling faces at the front counter and I informed them that I had filled out their FREE 3-Day Pass online. The associates guided me to a computer screen when I answered a few questions and entered in my information. A second associate then approached me and said she was going to give me a tour. I said okay great! I followed her around as she showed me the different parts of the gym and overall it was a pleasant experience....until we walked in to their sales area where she told me they had a special on family memberships (I had told her I was meeting a friend who had a membership there to play some basketball). I himmed and hawwed for a minute and said no thanks I'm not interested in a membership RIGHT THIS SECOND (mind you...I walked in the door about 2 minutes prior to this). She then said, "Okay, so you are just here to play basketball?" and I replied "ummm, yes?" hoping it would get me away from this awkward sales pitch where she was just staring at me when I said I wasn't currently interested. Instead, she then said "Okay, well since you are here just to play basketball you will have to pay our $10.00 one day pass" our associate at the front desk will help you. Then she walked me to the front and said he needs to pay the $10 and walked away. I was very confused as I had just signed up to receive emails/mail/marketing phone calls from you and in turn a free 3-day pass. The associate at the front desk said that there was a clause saying they could nullify the 3-day pass at their discretion which they do if you are just there to play basketball. I was confused to I went back to my car to get my wallet to pay 10$ to use my free 3day pass and proceeded to play basketball for a few hours.

I am new to Arizona (just got my new Arizona Drivers License today actually) and this is the closest gym to where I live. I'm probably going to go out of my way to "Just play basketball" somewhere else where they aren't time-share salesman. Honestly, I would have gladly just paid the $10 day pass but when you are presented the free 3-Day pass why not right? Here is the exact text from their email/website

So...instead of signing of for a membership (which I was probably going to do at some point) I am going to get a membership somewhere else and put your social media/yelp/etc. on blast for your bait and switch. Happy Tuesday.Sooooo..... Fight night. There we are. Every single fight. And lo and behold, KIDS are allowed at the bar until God-knows-when. Seriously. Children. In a bar. They were permitted to enter under "parental supervision" however, NO PARENTS to be found. The staff doesn't seem to mind. IT'S A COMPLETE BUZZ KILL. Also, total lack of seating for the absolutely expected crowd of games/fights/whatever is going on. Ridiculous. My point is...... STOP ADMITTING CHILDREN. This is NOT a family environment.Had gift certificates so figured, why not? Got the sampler, some beers, and some mashed potatoes. Nothing in the sampler was particularly good...and the mashed potatoes tasted like nothing other than undercooked potatoes.I phoned a front desk staffer who was so unhelpful.   She would not answer any general questions and was quite concealing in her responses always directing me to their website.  When I responded the info was not on their website, she would obnoxiously/repeatedly rephrase my questions saying she was not allowed to respond.  Truly an unfriendly experience for someone needing a root canal....guess I won't be seeing the endos as there's no transparency here.  Best to take your problem and wallet somewhere else.  Drs pls monitor and record your front desk, you may be surprised.Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. 

First, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. 

Most importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. 

So, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. 

So, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). 

The waiter responded -- "well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic." He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: "would you like something different?" 

OK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. 

Really, "do we want something different?" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. 

And come on..."it's organic"...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. 

I understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. 

Sure, eventually there was a rather late "sorry" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. 

On the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. 

The pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.

I could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. 

...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have.horrible. thank god it was comped dinner still it was not good at allFirst of all... too modern of a japanese restaurant. Most of the clientele are hip caucasian people.


a true japanese restaurant would serve you hot tea or Ocha as soon as you sit down. But here you have to ask for tea, water or others.

Our waiter was a little arrogant. He seems put off by the fact that we don't drink.. nor care to drink.

we ordered the Sashimi tasting menu $85 for 21 pieces. Sushi tasting with 13 pieces and 6 rolls. And Kobe Steak with Soy Garlic.

We were.. still hungry... eventhough the total bill was $298!!!!!!

not worth coming at all!!!When at Aria...GO FOR ANOTHER RESTAURANT.

You can read my details in a bit, but overall, I think the food sucks and overprice!

I went here because my wife wanted to have Italian.  It was also last minute so I did not do research.  I though since it is at Aria, how bad could it be?  Boy, was I wrong.  We did not want to wait another 30 minutes, so we went straight to the bar section where we can still order the same food.  We got the "regular" menu and the more "extravagant" menu.  I selected the meat lasagna.  My wife was about to order to clam lingunie, but I said since we are here why not go for the lobster ravioli...so she did.  When my meat lasagna came (pictured is available by another reviewer), it wasn't bad looking.  The taste was reasonable; although I think it is microwave.  The center was hot but not the outside.  Additionally, the food got cold quickly.  When the lobster ravioli came, we were totally disappointed!!!  The ravioli was extremely small.  They are about the size of a 1/2 dollar coin and flat!  I didn't taste any lobster.  It looked like somethng you order form Trader Joe's, boiled and served.  This item cost $39!!

The service was reasonable from bar.  So I paid my 15% as a courtesy.  However, I didn't realize my credit card was missing until an hour later.  My wife called the restaurant and they said they'll keep it up until closing; otherwise, they will have to give it to the security card if I don't pick it up by the same night.  I rushed back to the restaurant and talk to the front desk.  I was then told security came and insisted that the credit card to be held at their office.  So I had to go all the way to the security station.

So, overall, I think the food sucks and overprice.  Service was so so.  I tried other restaurants and I think they were most tasteful.Beautiful room and very good service.  The down side:  very noisy, very few value wines ($50 range), parmesan crackers that were stale, supermarket quality antipasto meats, supermarket quality lasagna, and a dry veal chip that tasted as if if were burnt.I was there with my friend on 5/23 for dinner and both had the tasting menu. I also had the wine paring. If I could give a negative star rating, I would. We paid $350 in total with multiple supplements. I got tin foil in one of my dishes. I got apologies and a new plate, but no offer to discount the bill. For this expensive a place, I was appalled, but didn't want to make a scene. I shouldn't have had to ask to have them do something to make up for it.  I have frequented many a Michelin star restaurant and most of the fine dining restaurants in San Francisco and Napa Valley.  In addition, we both felt the food was underwhelming.  This lack of customer service is shocking and insulting. This was supposed to be our nice meal of the trip and I couldn't have been more upset at the experience.Does this place deserve a one star? Yes on many levels. Let's start with the price. $32 for dinner on a Monday night. OUCH! I immediately look around to see if it's the decor or view that I am paying for but disappointed to find neither. Keep in mind for this price I expect the quality to be on par with Belagio, Wynn, Rio, and the M. So you think my money MUST go to the food. No such luck as the courses are typical of all the buffets here in Las Vegas, but served colder and under-seasoned.

The bottom line is don't waste your money and your calories here.If Aria, a 5-star hotel, is going to offer a buffet, you'd expect it to be spectacular or at least up to par. Bellagio has it, so why not Aria, right? I  came here with my family yesterday--truly DISAPPOINTED! My mom took a bite of the cold cut meat and spat it out because it had a foul taste and smell to it. I saw the meat, but didn't get it because they looked like they had been sitting there for a good while. I was going to try granola with yogurt, but it had a film on the yogurt as if it had been sitting there for a VERY LONG TIME. My first round barely filled the plate because nothing looked really fresh. I am not a picky eater or a harsh food critic, but I am not going to eat something that looks like it had been sitting there from last night. The tomato salad looked like it had been sitting there for a good while, too. Management is obviously the problem and ARIA NEEDS TO TAKE NOTE OF THIS! WHAT IS THIS PLACE TRYING TO DO? GIVE US FOOD POISONING??? C'mon!!! If your buffet selection is not great, at least make sure that your food is fresh. I was at the curry section yesterday and they didnt even bother to empty out the old curry. Instead, they just threw more fresh ones on top. The old ones on the bottom will only turn bad, it's not going to make it more fresh with the fresh ones on top. The only best section of the buffet was the dessert section. Even though options were not many, at least they looked decently fresh.If I am eating in a hotel like Aria I expect the food to be great!
The food was terrible. 
We asked for mixed vegetables in garlic sauce and all we got was Chinese broccoli. When we asked the waiter he said the chef did not think one should use other vegetables in that sauce.
They did not make us a vegetarian curry either.
Spring rolls were too oily!when you go there ...watch out for the lady changing the fruit and salad station.  They wear gloves, BUT, handles cleaning rag, then puts her same hands back in the food.  NASTY and contaminating.Waiting, still waiting. Ordered a delivery and it never showed. Had to do pizzahut as a back up after waiting an hour.I can't express how awful this store is. don't go to this location. drive to any other location!  the staff is useless. no one knows what they are doing. they just wander around looking down at their iPads trying to avoid customers it seems. and if you get Mackenzie just walk away. . someone should really punch him already.AWFUL, AWFUL, they do not wear gloves they touch everything with their
hands.come to this place for take out and they will expect you to tip them. for what? they make the food and you pick it up. and if you don't they will yell at you. very rude. food isn't the best. just ok.I've been here about 4 times and the last was what made me decide never to come back. I will say, the rolls are great. They have  a lot to choose from. However if your expecting it to come fast, think again. The service is very slow here and not friendly. They take forever to come take your order and don't visit your table very often, so when I ordered from here I would try to get most things I wanted in one visit. However that's not even good enough, like I said before, the food comes out very slow. I have no clue why. Last time I ordered sashimi and some rolls. All my rolls came first and then sashimi last. What's the point in the sashimi if I cant even get that first? Anyway I was here with a friend trying to enjoy the night when I noticed a few people down the table/booth seating quickly get up and whimper. Sure enough I look down  at my seat and there's a cockroach crawling right towards my leg. I got up quickly and started to lightly laugh, even though I was less than pleased. I didn't want to cause more of a scene since the other people were furious. They left without paying. The waitress explained to us that it never happens, and they sprayed that morning. Well if have to spray for bugs.. you must have a problem with it? Anyway, we finished our sushi, and no discount was offered for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I wont be returning.Don't bother!  The view is the only thing they have! What a joke! Nobody in the bar! Could it be because of the smelly mop bucket by the front door?I thought this place was horrible.  We were here Sunday late afternoon and evening October 16 2011.  The place is lovely enough as you walk through but nothing too special by Vegas standards.  The problems I had:  It's an extremely bright facility and super casual vibe as far as the loudness of the staff  and how they carry on.  It's not a very hushed space and does not offer that zen like quality most spas strive to design and deliver. We found the furniture to be firm, cushions as hard as rocks and had that made to last quality and not at all comfortable. My spa service was in a room right off the couples lounge with a white glass wall where you see every shadow walk by and hear everything.  After my service I requested a spa food menu as I waited in the couples lounge for my husband to finish up his massage.  The employee I spoke to yelled something to someone else around the corner and that someone else yelled back tell her it will be 45 minutes and how does she plan on paying for it. Nice.  When I was handed the menu it looked like it was ripped out of something and had food stains on it.  I handed it right back, I was no longer interested in food.  The entire  4 hours we we were there no one asked if we needed anything.   The ladies locker room  was clean but minimally stocked as far as amenities and had Britney Spears playing!! Upon checkout my husbands bill was still open and needed to be paid but mine was already closed out on my credit card with gratuity added without my knowledge.  The two young girls working the desk were very helpful and seemed concerned and they went back a few times to check with the manager who appeared to be right behind the wall of the front desk area where we were standing.  The manager NEVER showed their face to even talk to us or express interest or concern with our experience the girls just passed on the message the manager said they're not sure what happened with the credit card.  We will not be returning.  There are a lot of wonderful spas in Las Vegas for us to spend our time and money at.  This was very disappointing as we do love to spend time at The Green Valley Ranch resort and have never had this sort of experience at the good restaurants or hotel there.Do not eat here. I would give negative stars if I could. Waitress charged me $10 more.  When disputing it, she said that's because of tax, when it clearly said subtotal. It was my birthday and I waited an hour and a half for my bill, missed my movie. The manager is even worse. He slammed the receipt and rolled his eyes. I couldn't believe it. I wasnt rude, I was just disputing the charge. Theres a whole list more to say negative about this place, but it would be 2 pages long. ALSO, check your bill, they will try to charge you extra than what the menu states.Some friends and I went out for some pool and drinks at spirits. The doorman told us about a $5.00 wristband deal that would allow us to drink $1.00 you call it's until 11 pm. It was about a little before 10:00 pm so we figured it was a pretty decent deal and the 4 of us paid. We each had 1-2 drinks before ordering our next round. At this point it was 10:30 pm and when the waitress brought us our drinks she graciously informed me she would let us buy these drinks for the $1.00 price but that was it. I then informed her that the doorman told us it was until 11 pm and was told, "oh they don't ever tell us anything until last minute, it's 10:30 not 11:00" we got the same awesome customer service from the clueless doorman. Now, 5 bucks isn't going to make or break me but I feel like we got screwed over and it was our problem so we could deal with it, oh well. I think that's just shady business and we left after finishing our drinks. I wasn't about to give them more of my money and I don't ever intend to in the future. If you choose to spend your free time here, make sure you synchronize your watches...I've been to this location (W. Flamingo/Grand Canyon) three times in the past month. Every time, I've had to wait 15 minutes or more for one smoothie. Twice I went into the cafe and once I went through the drive-thru. 

When I tried the drive-thru, there were only 3 cars in line. Waited in line for 15 minutes, only to be told (when I got to the window) that they didn't get my order so I had to wait another 5 minutes as they made it. 

The last time I went in (on a Sunday afternoon), I waited almost 25 minutes for one smoothie!!! It looked like there was only one person working the register and the same person was making the smoothies. Right before I left, I saw 3 other employees pop up, but who knows what they were doing the whole time.

Won't go to this location ever again.I simply came in to ask for an appointment an the Asian woman there was extremely rude. She didnt look at me at all..the place was empty and she said she couldn't provide me with a pedicure. She didn't check her schedule or ask me to come back. Don't recommended this place at all!!!!!! Staff is extremely stuck up...they do nails...come on!!! Negative 5 stars!!!Grace is extremely unprofessional. Answered her cell phone while dealing with customers to talk to what sounded like a CPS employee about a child. 

Later in the day I was called and asked to come back and pay more knee because Grace did not charge me correctly. I will never go back to this establishment.The service was horible and so was the food. I'll never go back to this place. Plain sucks and the are very cheap about the food. I was told I can have anythin on the menu and then told that I can on have 2 peices of musselsI lived in these apartments from June 2011 until about 2 weeks ago and let me say this:

This is, hands down, the WORST experience I have EVER had with a rental community. I kept the apartment in very good condition and followed all rules and regulations. I payed my rent on time as per my rental agreement and was an upstanding member of the Shade community. Shade apartments, however, failed to do the same. Where do I begin??

- Every single day, no matter what time of day, I had to walk my puppy around the piles of feces left all over the property. The ground are absolutely disgusting!

- There was NO noise ordinance despite their "rules" about quiet time after 10pm 

- There were drunk people and homeless people sleeping at the pool

- My apartment was infested with cockroaches and bugs and I am a CLEAN person!

- Now, upon move out, I am being told that I owe close to $800 for replacement of carpet because of "excessive pet damage". The carpet was of the lowest grade possible; a step up from a thin stack of papers and every time I walked on the carpet I risked getting a staple in my foot. The black top from the outside traveled onto the carpet with me which is normal wear and tear, NOT excessive pet damage. My puppy is all of 9 lbs and NEVER had one accident in the apartment. When I spoke to someone in corporate, she made it clear that she could have cared less. Her response to my concerns were "oh well, I'm sorry you feel that way".

I would not recommend this place to ANYONE!I was so disappointed! 
Petit Fromage is now located inside Delicious Dishes. There is only a small case of cheese. I asked a staff member which of the blue cheeses she preferred and she wrinkled her nose and said "eww I don't eat blue cheese". HUH?? Needless to say I was ready to walk out. I asked which of the cheeses were made locally besides the one brand of goat cheese I recognized and she began looking around to find the place of origin. 
These people don't know anything about the cheese and the selection is awful!I have been meaning to get around to making a Yelp account for a while now, mostly for all of the great places I like to go. However, the final motivating factor for me to make this account was the terrible experience I had here. 

I arrived on a weekday afternoon around 4:25. My boss had sent me out to grab us some food while he worked with a client. I ordered two chicken dinner platters to go. We had worked through lunch that day and I was starving. The food took well over 30 minutes. This is not an exaggeration, I checked the time on my receipt. My to go order literally took over thirty minutes. The people behind the counter apologized multiple times, but that really doesn't mean much to me when my boss is waiting on our food and I have to come back over half an hour later, like an idiot, from a restaurant I picked. Seriously, it is this strips of chicken on skewers. There is no way it should take that long to cook. 

Before this I had only been here once before. That previous time, I had arrived mid-day on a Saturday, half-drunk from a pool party. I remember thinking that the service was slow that time too, but like I said, I was half-drunk. 

I can now say with confidence that with both of my experiences here, the 'Express' in the name of the establishment is a joke. The food is tasty but not worth the half hour wait. I will never return to this establishment.Went there for lunch today, and was not a big fan.

They charged me extra because i wanted veggies & chicken in my burritto bowl, and hardly gave me any chicken. Came to just under $9.00.

The food was average at best, I would do Chipotle any day over this place.

The girls behind the counter were not all that helpful either.This review pertains to their subsidiary airline, "Go!" in the Hawaiian islands. Don't Fly Go!
Wow! I have never run into a less competent airline. These people couldn't run a bicycle-rickshaw taxi service, let alone an airline. If you're spending a lot of money to come and enjoy the islands, don't do what I've done, which is book interisland flights through go. They'll be at least an hour late most of the time. However, today one flight left 12 minutes early, and so I missed my connection. I watched my aircraft pull away as I was arriving on another - they couldn't hold it for two minutes. Why?
Because they don't care. At all! Not even a little. No apology for allowing an aircraft to leave 12 minutes early, consigning me to an later flight. This is, fortunately, the last flight I've booked with Go, and I will never, ever book another flight with them, or with any other Mesa Air Group airline.If you guys could only see the type of van they deliver in. After reading OnTrac reviews on yelp I instantly got frightened that my shipment containing a mother board and other expensive computer items would be lost and or stolen. So I opened my garage door and waited for them to show up. They didn't show up late but... the type of delivery truck they used wasn't even a truck. It was a beat down old shady looking van with 1 sticker on the back that had the companies name on it. The guy pulls up and asks me if this was the address and I said yes. He opens the back of his truck and the boxes are just thrown in there. I see fragile seals. with the boxes flipped and thrown all over the place. Horrible. I actually got a picture of the dude and the van.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A7NSII6CAAEbtUk.jpg

The guy who delivered was extremely rude and seemed like he just wanted to get his runs over with. 

Good luck to anyone else who uses or is condemned to using this company.These guys are slackers.
They screw up Amazon Prime orders and make Amazon look bad.
Waited the whole day for a package but didn't arrive, no word from anyone.
Amazon Prime never fails, unless of course its delivered by Ontrac.
Their tracking online is centuries away from FedEx and UPS.

Avoid like a plagueBeing a fan of Emeril's restaurants, we decided to go here for lunch and so my partner could watch a few games and were excited to try this place out.

I cannot rate the food because we never got to eat.  The service was spectacularly poor-  Rude waitstaff and the hostesses seems to be terribly bothered by our arrival.  We waited and waited to order drinks, and then waited some more for them to come.  The only server we could see in the place was beyond rude, and actually waled away from us while we were trying to place an order.

Though it is probably needless to say, we will NOT be back.OMG!!!!! I can"t believe how terrible the service and food was. First of all they treat travelzoo customers like crap. When they say we had a travezoo coupon they brought out this hand written white piece of paper menu. Are you kidding me. You only had four choices to choice from for apps and entree. The red head spiked man waiter is full of you know what and need to quick or quickly get fired!!!!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE EMERIL ! HE NEEDS TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS RESTAURANTS AND NOT JUST COLLECT THE MONEY. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!DO NOT GO HERE.  Reservations are recommended.  However, regardless of how far in advance you make a reservation, they can choose to rent the place out to  anytime they want.  Then they have some snotty waitress call you and try to "sell" you on attending another time.  

It's apparent that Emeril has sold out and turned in to just another jerk trying to make a buck without regard to how his customers are treated.  NOT ONLY WILL I NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE... he has 3 restaurants in New Orleans and I will be sure to tell everyone I know in Louisiana to not patronize these places either.

I am shocked at how I was treated and if this place continues to treat people this way, they'll sink themselves.I made an appointment at  this location to look at dresses for my bridesmaids and myself. The customer service was definitely lacking. When my bridesmaids had gathered an armful of dresses to try on, I was the one that grabbed them and went and found a dressing room (while one of the employees watched me). They had to find their own undergarments to try on with the dresses. We had to ask for clips to pin in some of the dresses. All of this should have been done for us since we had an appointment. When I decided to look at dresses for myself I told the lady what I wanted. Instead of offering to show me what dresses they had similar to what I wanted she just said that they did have some dresses similar and left it at that. I ended up going and looking myself. In addition to having no customer service they had very few sizes to try on. My MOH fell in love with one of the dresses and decided to get it there. The rest of us went across the way to David's Bridal where we had another appointment scheduled. We all ended up getting our dresses there instead.7.14.12.  After two months of waiting for someone to replace screws into the concrete block wall from the broken security gate--the company finally fixed this.  They also finally completed the pony wall 6 months later.  We got the landscaping contract after the job was finished last year, as we were afraid our plants would die, and we wanted some insurance.  Well, the landscaping crew just came yesterday.  It does not appear that they trimmed any of the plants/lantanas or trees.  There are two plants that died.  We have generally had to wait months before the plants have been replaced.  We'll see how long it takes them to replace the two that died.  Take a look at the pictures and tell me whether it looks like our yard has been serviced by a professional landscaping company.I had a kind of unique situation in my dealings with Mini of Las Vegas. I was driving my friend's car while she was teaching for a year in Korea. Before she left for Korea, she had the car serviced at Mini of LV and was told nothing was wrong with it other than the car needing new tires. I had the car for about six months when the check engine light came on. My friend said she thought she still had a warranty and to call the dealership. I called and spoke with Chris in Finance who advised me that there was a warranty in place and that I should get the car in as soon as possible. I dropped the car off and was told there was a diagnostic fee of almost $170. I said that there was a warranty in place and they said that the $170 would go toward the deductible. I got a call a few days later from Carlos in the Service Department advising that the repairs would cost about $3000+. I asked what would be covered by the warranty and he said there was no warranty. I told him about my conversation with the Finance Department and he said he would speak to them and call me back. There was a whole bunch of back and forth between me, Chris and Carlos. I feel like it was just a total and complete bait and switch. There is no way that I would have brought the car into the dealership had I been given the right information at the time of my initial call to Mini of LV. I didn't get the repairs done and asked them to waive the diagnostic fee because of the mix up on their part. Carlos advised me that would "work with me" on the fee and reduce it to $100. When I picked the car up, I was told by the cashier that the fee was $120. Seriously? I ended up paying the $120 just to get the heck out of there. I am beyond disappointed with the false information of the finance department, the lack of communication between departments at the same location, and the lack of customer service given by all of the people I dealt with.I really don't know what the rave about this place is!?  Came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and ordered the single burger with some fries.  The gal at the counter was super nice and cool.  

However, I can't say the same for the burger.  Pretty simple one patty burger with tomatoes, onions, and pickles....um...yeah that's about it.  My patty was not super dry, but darn close.  The bun was you basic hamburger bun.  So really why does it cost what it cost for such a simple burger.  Because it's made with a "modern" grill?  I could get the same at Mc'ds and be more content and plus at least I'll get a toy with it in a pretty box.  Mines with in a brown bag with Modern Burger stamp....yahhhh....... :(

Overall, I'm baffle why people would compare this burger as one of the best in town.  Shame on you fools!  I wasn't even in a bad mood when I came  -- was totally in an awesome mood so nope -- last time I checked I don't have those time of the months.  Maybe someday I'll feel to give this a try, but for now; sorry folks can't recommend - Enjoy!Never again. I have been to the location in ahwatukee before and like the yogurt so I decided to try to one near my house. I was ordering and I noticed the woman wasn't listening to me she was listening to two customers behind me. I turned around to see what was so intriguing and noticed the other customers were intensely staring at the ground near my feet. I looked down and there was a cockroach crawling across the floor! The woman behind the counter didn't do anything and the customers ended up seeing a random broom laying around, grabbed it and smashed it over and over again before my unbelieving eyes. I paid for the yogurt I ordered but I threw it out before taking one bite. The yogurt is good but not good enough to make me forget about what I saw.WORST FILIBERTOS EVER. They seriously just tried to charge me 6.50 for two beef tacos! This filibertos menu and their prices as well as quality of food has always been subpar to the majority of filibertos in the valley. Their food was always about 70 percent as good as other Filibertos I've been to but now charging so much it's definitely not worth the visit. Most other filibertos in the valley charged a 1.99 for a taco. I could have gotten this in a combination plate for 6.50,  same chain all other locations. This restaurant won't be around for long if they keep this upUnfortunately, the staff (non-instructors) here are severely incompetent, in particular the sales manager. My experience pertains to bringing a family member to the gym in order for her to try out the gym, which resulted in a  verbally abusive, utterly unprofessional encounter.

Upon inquiring of the staff in-person previously, I was instructed by the front desk staff to apply for a 1-week trial membership in person at the gym, as opposed to downloading online (3-day passes only). Rather than acknowledging his staff had thus misinformed me, this sales manager was extremely offended that I maintained this was the instruction I had received, and denied that the gym ever provides 1-week memberships. Verbatim, he dismissed his entire front desk staff: "don't talk to them, they don't know anything, they should direct you to the sales staff." Ironic that he would both treat his client and staff with outright rudeness.

Fortunately, am here on a short-term membership plan, would never consider long-term membership at this location.Restaurant is out of business.Very displeased with the food you get better taste at taco bell, tortilla soup literally "velveeta soup, ceviche not good, taco platter w/rice and beans, frozen dinners are better. Don't recommend it. Oh by the way the happy hour drinks not soooo good slurpees have more taste.Sorry apple. Love your products. This store needs a major overhaul of practice , procedures and customer awareness. ATTN: Manager.
I Have now left this store for the third time unable to
Complete a purchase. Hard to believe, but true simply  because no  "specialists" were available 
 to process the transaction. In the end I purchased my iPhone from at&t and it was a great experience. My iPad from target And now I am going to purchase my new Mac book online. I wanted to
Have it for today, but will have to wait for UPS. Either way Apple still gets my business .
But is this really a long term successful business practice?
Apple might want to look at GM to remind them of what they don't want to become. And yes I am frustrated. I just wanted to spend some money  and they would not take it at this store.I read the reviews before coming here... I thought this place would be a great new park to take my dog to since we just moved to the area. Prior, we had been going to the surprise dog park. Within 15 minutes of getting there my dog was attacked by 3 pittbulls. The owner could have cared less nor did he try to pull their dogs off mine. I fought these dogs off mine until I could free her. I was so in fear for my dogs life I rushed her off to the ER Vet and didn't get contact info. I had a $900 bill and needless to say I will never return. I know this is an isolated incident but please beware of aggressive dogs at this park.Hands down one of the worst cocktails I ever had anywhere!!!

Went to this places on a Saturday evening with a few friends after dinner!
Asked waiter for some cocktail recommendations...
4 of us got the espresso Martinis!
they had the cheapest lousiest Vodka (tasted like turpentine)! 
Another buddy ordered a White Russian & he was complaining of the same thing. When we brought this up to waiter he did absolutely nothing! The six of us closed our tab & left after this experience & will never go back!Yesterday was the second time I have tried this restaurant (04-15-2012). The first time the food was ok, but the service was great. And the view of the valley is amazing! This time was anything but good! The food was again, just ok. But we were just going out for nachos, so it is hard to mess those up. We sat at the bar. They had 3 bartenders on, not a one of which had a clue what to do. It took forever to get our drinks, and we were never once checked on when we got our food. When we sat for 20 minutes with empty plates and empty drinks in front of us it was obvious we were not going to be offered anything else so once we finally got one of the bartenders attention and asked for our check we were told just a minute. Five minutes later we still had no check and she was just walking around behind the bar putting glasses up. We then asked another bartender for our check. Again nothing. By now it has been almost 40 minutes trying to get a check. I am still unclear as to the problem since there was only 2 other couples at the bar during this whole time, and the restaurant was not very busy either. So 3 bartenders would have been over kill in any other restaurant in town. But not a single one of them seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing so I guess they needed all 3 idiots. We finally went to the hostess stand to ask someone to get our check. When asked how our dinner was I smiled and let them know the view is amazing, the food was ok, but the service was so bad that I would never be back, and to keep in mind I have a very big mouth and will probably be telling everyone I come across about what a bad experience this was. I am a local bartender as well. I come across quite a few guests in that  general area. I would think with so many choices for mexican food in this town and so many restaurants struggling to stay open in these tough times they would be able to find someone that actually wants to make sure the guest is happy. I guess the fact that their food is just ok, and they don't seem to have to strive for better there why bother with the service? The name on our check was Adriana. I have no idea which of the 3 she was, but it really doesn't matter. All three were equally as bad with their skills, or actually lack their of! 
Save your time and money and go someplace that actually appreciates your business. This place obviously does not!IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OVER PRICED, SEVEN DOLLAR JUICE, EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE, AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, BB KINGS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!


After eating here in August (yes August, and it is now December), I will never give them my business again. I write to you months later because this is how long the dispute has been going on for, and still no one from their company has called to settle it.

 

This past august my family stayed at the Mirage. BB Kings was the only breakfast place, so we gave it a shot. After finishing my breakfast (an egg dish) and my orange juice, my party received the check. My eyes bulged as I saw the mediocre orange juice I had just finished was SEVEN DOLLARS. Listen, I am a Los Angeles girl (born and raised), and anyone who knows me knows I am not opposed to spending money on a good meal. In this instance however, next to being sprinkled with gold, this orange juice was no where near being worth seven dollars. Before speaking to someone I checked a menu to make sure it wasn't me who had bypassed the price listed, but surprise surprise, there WERE no drink prices listed. Here's where the great customer service comes in.

 

After speaking to a manager, I was asked if my waitress had warned us that the juice was seven dollars at this establishment. Clearly my answer was no. She apologized, voiced that they were supposed to inform all customers of this cost, and that she would comp "the entire bill." Sounds like a good compensation, and like I always say, it's about how an establishment handles problematic occurrences that sets their bar. I had washed my hands of the whole ordeal, or so I thought.

 

Finally I received my monthly credit card bill, and here's where the dilemma began. BB Kings and their great accounting department charged me for the whole meal and then comped me for the meal. Sounds good right? It was Void. But later down in the bill another charge for the entire cost of the meal was on my statement. Despite the easy math, no one at the restaurant could comprehend the problem with these charges. If you charge someone twice and comp them once, YOU ARE STILL CHARGING THEM! After sitting on the phone with several managers at BB Kings, explaining the entire experience several times over, and being told that someone would be in touch with me within a day, I figured it had to click for SOMEone on their end. Well that was in September...so you do the math.I have yet to hear from anyone.

I WON'T BE GIVING THEM MY BUSINESS ANY TIME SOONThis is with a doubt the worst sephora I have ever been to, and i have been to many of them! Upon arrival the store was dirty, disheveled and no employees bothered to greet me, or my sister! We walked in with the intention of purchasing a liquid eyeliner, lip glosses and mascara. We asked two different girls for help. Both times we were ignored. Finally my sister had enough and went directly to an employee and asked for help. The girl rolled her eyes several times and gave as much attitude as she could possibly muster. When my sister complimented her eyeliner she responded with "it's JUST Sephora" in a derogatory manner. Her lack of enthusiasm for JUST Sephora brand make-up has convinced me to never purchase JUST Sephora again. I will continue to purchase MAC and Estee Lauder.

Overall the employees are rude, hateful and lack knowledge about make-up products. I will never return to this sorry excuse of a Sephora for as long as I live and I will continue to spread the truth about the b*****$ that work here!

I hate to give a negative rating to Sephora but the treatment we received by the employees was outlandish and uncalled for! I guess Sephora doesn't care too much about the economic depression, but we consumers do; and I will continue to take my business to make-up personnel with knowledge, and manners who actually like the company they work for and support their brand.I have to say I was pretty disappointed in my first (and last) visit here. Upon walking in, the short brunette hostess/server with braces said "hi. Two?". No smile, horrible demeanor. After that lovely intro, I noticed the interior was very nice but the food immediatley negated it all. Our queso dip was okay, nothing special. The actual entrees were abysmal. I had the 6 rolled tacos which had slim to no meat in them and though I put sour cream and pico on them, the pico was lackluster and soggy, adding no flavor. I ate 2 of them and raised my white flag to surrender. My boyfriend got the enchilada platter and said it was "disgusting". Well, my love, you dragged me here over where I wanted to go, so. We left our plates and appetizer barely touched, paid our bill and left. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Never again.Brought my Buick in for a simple oil change and was told that I had $2348 worth of oil leaks. I have never seen a single drop of oil on my driveway so I took my car for a second opinion. Thank Goodness the other (more honest) shop told me that absolutely NOTHING was needed! I will never set foot in this location again!At lot of attitude and bad food? No thanks.

There's a vicious cycle when it comes to making assumptions about your patrons. You think, 'they look young and they ordered tap water. I bet they aren't going to spend much money here. I am going to ignore them." Well you know what happens when you never see your waiter again and have to order through managers all night? You get a bad tip.

We ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude.

There are much better options out there. I will not be back.Food Poisoning (Salmonella) is what we got!  My husband and I took our 4 kids here Friday night 11-25-11 Black Friday.  Ordered the all meat pizza.  Our 7 yr old didn't want it.  So he got the PBJ and apple off kids menu.  He never ate the pizza.  My husband and two daughters ate some of his apple.  My other son and I didn't.  Later that night my 7 yr old son complained of headache and stomach ache.  He started vomiting.  Next morning my 13 yr old daughter complained of same thing and vomited all over.  Then an hour later my husband started vomiting and terrible stomach pains and explosive diarrhea.  My 17 yr old daughter then got headache. She went on to a baseball game.  While there she vomited terribly in the bathroom all over the floor, toilet and herself.  Very humiliating.  The drive home was an hour and she was so sick. My 16 yr old son and I are the only ones not sick.  The apple is the only common denominator.  Fevers set in and back/neck pains.  I have never cleaned up so much vomit and crap in my life.  

I called MM manager and told him. He was clueless.  He couldn't understand how an apple could do this.  Hello?  What do you use to cut the apple?  Where did you cut it?  Did you wash it before serving?  Did the cook wash his hands after touching raw meat before he cut the apple?  Figure it out!!! Before you get all your customers sick to death!   OMFG.   Mellow my ass!  This food poisoning was nothing like Mellow.  It was awful. 

We have been here 3 other times.  First time they burnt our pizzas.  The other two times were ok.   Pizza is not bad, but not my favorite.  Very disappointing. We won't be going back.  I'll find a better place to spend a $75.Closed.  The new restaurant in it's place is called Mandarin Buffet.  Haven't tried it yet.Wow this place sucks.  Girlfriend got sick and the food was way overpriced.  Staff was nice until they realized how disapointed we were with the purple burger buns and nasty wiped avacado mayo and ignored us, probably because they recommended the meal we got.  I think they realize how much their lives suck working a horrible sugar factory location that just poisons and robs customers.ClosedThings got ugly!!! 2 employees: 2 different stories. The customer service was lackluster yesterday, but reached epic EVIL today!! I was told by an employee I could exchange a shirt I bought on sale for my husband for store credit and less than 24 hours before and when I arrived today, the manager said, oh no it says on the receipt,  "all sales are final". I explained that I had spoken to 2 of her employees yesterday, one of whom said I COULD NOT return it and the other who said I COULD NOT return it for a refund BUT COULD RETURN it for a store credit or exchange. The size was slightly off, so I brought one of the shirts back to exchange it for some items I had looked at yesterday (in case I had to return the shirt). Amy, the manager refused the exchange saying "the policy is the policy." So when I explained to her that I was informed by HER EMPLOYEE something different she said, "I am not the owner, I don't make the policy" well, whoever the owner is, I hope you understand that is NOT the type of service that will earn my loyalty or that one might expect, especially in an upscale shopping center like the Scottsdale Quarter  (but really anywhere).  I work in customer service and I would NEVER have lost a customer for life over a 20 dollar sale exchange.  I dislike when managers don't stand behind their employees and won't do what is right for the customer. So unfortunately,  I would not shop there again and can't recommend it to anyone.This place has super fast service but that is about it.  The bread is terrible.  It is dry and stale.  They also have minimal topping choices.  I would rather wait the extra few minutes at Subway for my sandwich.My business partner and I are always all over the city and noticed the Native New Yorker sign was removed from the store and a banner for "The Brickyard" was in its place. Figured we would stop in and check it out and drop off a card in case they were shopping for a new sign. The waitress was very nice, almost too nice and offered up more information about the business than I would want my employee too. Apparently the owners disengaged from the N.N.Y franchise, there are legal issues, she's the only waitress left with the changes, etc. The place looks exactly the same, but they now advertise $.36 cent wings on Tuesday, not $.35 cents. Apparently this is a N.N.Y thing and being they disenfranchised, can't advertise it. The waitress made sure to tell me "they still only charge $.35 though". I ordered 20 wings and a soda, my business partner ordered the philly cheese steak and a soda. The place was pretty dead, but it took a good 20 minutes to get our orders. The wings were nothing special...lots of breading, sauce had little flavor. My biz partner said the same thing about his sandwich. After eating 12 of the 20 wings, I figured I would take them to go and asked for a box. I was responded to with a sign and a roll of the eyes from the waitress, who said "I can't take them". She informed us that the wing price was for dine in orders only and that I HAD TO LEAVE THEM THERE!!! She said they lose money on the wings and expect people to order other things to help offset the loss. Sure, I could see if I came in and ordered 50 wings, ate one with a glass of water and left. We came in, ordered food, at there and ordered other stuff. The waitress made a huge scene and a lady at another table overheard the commotion and let me know she ordered wings too, but the waitress told her she needed to order a drink to get the wings for that price (which isn't noted on their window advertising at all). She made a point of sitting another couple next to us and telling them it was Tuesday wing day and you can only eat the wings there, no matter what else you order. What a joke. I told her if she would have said that to me before I ordered, I would have gotten one wing at a time and made her run back and forth to the kitchen. I also asked her what they would do with the wings I didn't eat if I didn't take them with me, she said they would throw them out. So apparently that's how they treat their customers. She said she was sick of the place because this happens all the time. I guess she should be a little more clear with the customers or this place needs to stop being so damn cheap. I won't be heading back to the Brickyard anytime soon. There's a Native New Yorker on 19th ave and Happy Valley that appreciates my business.I was contemplating on giving them two stars, but I really had to reach here and think of something else nice to say and basically came up with nothing, so here goes.

This is our first visit. The place was packed so I thought, "Must be a good sign, right." There was one empty table, but the hostess didn't even move and just pointed it out to us and said, "You can just sit over there." 

Food here gets no love from me. We ordered 2 orders of negitoro and salmon hand rolls, combination plate w/ 2 entrees (garlic chicken & miso black cod) which is supposed to come with miso soup, salad, rice, and dessert. We also got a spider roll. Let's start with what I liked, which was the miso black cod. I thought it was delicious and cooked just right. I would order this again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with the rest of our orders. The garlic chicken was so greasy and just didn't look right. I had garlic chicken before from 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate which I loved, so I was expecting it to resemble that but I was let down. The salmon hand roll is ok. I had better at a Korean/Sushi/Chinese place we dined at yesterday. The negitoro was worse. It was basically just tuna sliced in cubes with scallions hurriedly put on top. The spider roll was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a long time: completely drenched in sauce that it completely fell apart when I barely picked it up with my chopsticks. I had a small bite and quickly put it back to the plate. The dessert never came to our table so I cannot comment on it. 

At this point I just want to leave and move on so we asked for the bill. Our combo plate was supposed to be $14.95 but we were charged $29. They could have thought we ordered 2 combo plates but our bill specifically stated: 1 Combo B: $29.99. I pointed it out and the lady apologized and fixed the mistake right away. I'm just glad I caught it while we were still there. Needless to say I am not coming back.Awful. The staff here is a joke. Made a reservation a week in advance for a group of 10 people for a bachelor party. They gave away our table as we were waiting and were forced to wait another hour as other groups arrived and were seated promptly. Definitely ruined the one group dinner event we had planned and did a good job of making us feel as if our business did not matter.The food is disgusting!Great food.  Way overpriced.  Tableside guacamole.  Two people, bill was over $250.  I'd say that it was some real expensive Mexican food.Want food poisoning several times over? Then this is the place to gamble! With the last few times my family and I have been here over this past year, we've won the sickness almost every time.

When this location first started, it was great. I've been a fan of Filibertos for years, and when this opened, I was grateful. But recently, things have gone awry and we no longer go here because of the horrible problems we receive after we've eaten. Along with that, they've also gotten our orders wrong a few times. We once received a lengua (cow tongue) taco instead of our ordered beef taco. I'm disappointed in this establishment.the absolute worst service EVER!!!!!You are not allowed to use the wireless. Thats pretty sad.  But they do have diet cokeThis place use to be sushi dans, all they did is change the name.the service is horrible and we were the only ones in there during dinner, guess I know why now. I went in for the AYCE and sake they tried to charge me for the sake, even though they had a sign outside saying it was AYCE and sake. This place is a joke, the sushi isn't half bad but the whole experience killed it.There are way better sushi places in vegas than here, like blue fin!I called their 877# for information & to book a Hoover Dam Deluxe tour .  April answered both times and she is a very rude, impatient woman.   As I write this, I am currently on hold for the second time, as the first time I was "disconnected."  The first time I was on hold for 5 minutes until disconnect, and am now on hold for this 2nd call over 5 minutes.  (It's on their dime, so I don't care!!!)  Still no one has picked up to help me.  I am getting nowhere and they are not getting my money either!!!  By the way, April just hung up on me, again!!!I'm the only one here slow down, manager Kathleen isn't a very good people person. I would probably demote her to back of the restaurant so she can't interact with anyone.I have been to this location many times, as well as other locations (Bell and 35th, Scottsdale and Carefree).  It is a pretty good breakfast place, but the service can often be sub par at this location.   

This morning, I brought my parents, wife and 2 year old there.  45 minutes after placing our order we asked how long until our food would be out, 10 minutes after that I went to find the manager.

The manager treated me like I was an idiot, told me that it was taking a while because it was busy (it wasn't very busy compared to some mornings, there were a number of empty tables inside and out).  I explained to her that two tables that were seated 15-20 minutes after us have their meals, and she said it was busy again.  I then pointed out that a family of four that was seated just before us had finished their meal and left, she again told me it was really busy.

I am going to assume that the waitress did not put our meal in, mistakes happen.  I understand that we all make mistakes, but it is what you do after a mistake that makes all the difference.  Don't treat your customers as if they are idiots, tell them that a mistake was made, and that you are fixing it.

To add insult to injury, a waitress tried to carry all of our meals out on her arms with no tray, and dropped my mom's meal.  Happy Mother's Day!  They also forgot a side I ordered.  

The manager did take 50% off the bill, in the future I will drive the extra 10 miles to Scottsdale and Carefree Highway, and I suggest you do as well.We have been going to this Cracker Barrel for a year and a half, since we moved here and it progressively gets worse. The last four times the biscuits were so hard they could be used as hockey pucks. The kitchen help and the waitresses have to know that the biscuits are no longer fresh and need to be thrown away. The gravy was the consistancy of mached potatoes and the hasbrown casserole was dried out  beyond salvation. If the management doesn't open there eyes this place will soon be a ghost town. I will wait several weeks and see if they read this and make the necessary changes, if not, my money spends elsewhere.it's dennys, long wait for food, lackluster service and a hair in the eggs that tasted like vinegar make this a visit that I hope we will all soon forget. It made me feel cheap and dirty, like I needed a shower after having ate a turkey burger with a stale bun. =-(We have been going to Hula Hawaiian BBQ in Buckeye since it opened. At the beginning they were competing with the local Chinese joint. Hula's food was not great, but it was good and the portions were very generous. Later on the local Chinese joint went t!ts up and Hula was the only remotely Asian place in town. Lately the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions leave much to be desired. The prices, however, didn't change; we spend on average $20 there. Today, 8/23/2011 at around 7pm, I went with my family again but only my wife ordered food totaling about $12 and me and my 8yo son brought a couple of sandwiches from Quiznos next door. Like we always do, we all shared on my wife's drink. We've always had free refills at Hula but today, when I sent my son to refill his soda he was told that we couldn't because we brought food from outside and can't share. WTF??? REALLY??? After I've spent hundreds of $ in that place over the years they're denying a kid a $.05 refill? Well, we're done! That $.05 soda refill just cost you our business. Buckeye is a very small town and restaurants here can't afford to lose business. That explains why the joint was empty. Oh joy! They're opening a Panda Express next door!While our buying experience was excellent - except for the 3 hour wait because they had to use the nissan dealer next door - when we received our paperwork in the mail we discovered they had not used our preapproved CU, instead they sold our paper to another lender - costing us time and money to get it changed. After reading Yelp and Google reviews, it appears this is a common practice. I'll file my complaint with the BBB and have learned my lesson - no matter how nice they are, they are still in business to make money - by doing whatever they have to.My hair still looks awful thanks to the butcher McKenzie. 

The owner did NOT handle the situation well when I went into the "salon" (aka, ghetto strip mall location, do not be fooled by the pictures). She just kept telling me she couldn't make my hair grow back...obviously. 

Please save yourself and learn from my mistake.

This place should be ashamed to call themselves a business. Look at my pictures of the hack job and see for yourself.  Somehow they got the LEGITIMATE picture I posted removed from their page...a shame really because I'm sure it'll happen again.First off,  DO NOT RENT FROM PAYLESS UNLESS YOU ARE A LAWYER AND ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD COMPANY TO SUE.
Just to start I have rented at least 50 cars and have never gotten the extra insurance offered by a rental agency.  At Payless the agent asked me if  I wanted the extra insurance.  I had two quotes from Orbitz and Autoslash for approx. $157 for a five day rental.  I spent hours looking for good deals because Phoenix is known as an expensive place to rent cars especially because of airport and state taxes and fees.  
Anyway, the agent told me that my rate was $164 which is not much more than the $157 but I showed her my quote on Orbitz and she stated "that is just an estimate".  No big deal but now I am starting to feel like this is where they start pulling a few extra dollars out of you.  
She directs me to put my initials on about five different places on the contract and at this point I tune out.  Usually they want me to initial noting that I have declined the extra insurance (collision damage waiver) which was $26/day on top of the rental base rate of $18/day.  
Long story short.  I return the car.  By the way the guy at the counter is hanging around and asks me for the keys and contract.  Usually at returns someone meets you as you pull in to check the mileage and give you a receipt.  Then I see a receipt and charges for $334!!  I was floored and angered.  I spoke to the agent upstairs at the counter and he said he couldn't help and to call after 8am.  I spoke to the manager and she said I signed the contract and initialed that I had agreed to the coverage.
How am I responsible. Ok, in retrospect I could have looked everything over before I initialled anything and before I signed anything.  To my everlasting chagrin my verbal statement that I did not want the extra insurance was not enough to spare me from their heavy handed "upselling" of the added insurance.  Further, when I complained that they were charging me $164 instead of $157 I made an assumption that I was only going to have to pay $164 not $334 which she never stated to me.  
What have  I learned?  Never rent from Payless again.  I don't want to spend my whole life having to read all the fine print on every rental contract when all I want to do is get my car and get to bed.  
What galls me so much is that I used a website (autoslash) which will reserve a car for you and then check the prices and will rebook your car if the prices go down.  I spent at least an hour maybe more reserving the best priced car rentals for my recent trip to Phoenix and Dallas and now I feel like a fool for having spent so much time trying to get a good deal only to get hosed by Payless b/c they juiced my contract with this insurance. 
My question is whether the sales agents make a commission or receive some bonus or incentive for selling the added insurance? Sometimes, (as in this case) they sell this hard saying that your credit card doesn't really cover very much if you do have damage to the vehicle etc.Warning!  Please don't go there, fresh maybe.  Service OK.  I don't think they know how to mix flavors good.  It was freakishly weird-tasting.Everytime I come here they mess up my drink... The only I like about this location is the baked goods. Never will I return againWorst pediatric dentistry I have ever taken my kids to. I have a 5 year old girl and a 3 year old boy. Once we were called back and waiting for the dentist to see my girl, my boy gets up from his chair reaches down into something (and at this exact moment the dentist is walking in) turns out to be a disposal box for biohazard needles! I about had a heart attack! I told the dentist and his assistant that my son had reached into that box and I didn't know wether he was poked or not. They kinda just blew me off and I asked the assistant as to why that box was on the floor, open, at a pediatric office where there is going to be kids all around she said "its because it's easier for the anesthesiologist" I continued with the visit but in the end I told one of the ladies in the front & she told the manager and she filed an incident report sent me off to concentra to get him tested. Long story short they couldn't help me there so we ended up in the PCH ER room were the doctor said it was unlikely that he was poked, blood was not drawn but that Cute Smiles 4 kids had just violated so many health regulations for leaving a bio hazard box on the floor open and just because it's easier for the anesthesiologist is unexceptable. Needless to say I'm not going back!This place is closed!This place is RIDICULOUS.  Yesterday I took my 2004 Wrangler in for an alignment.  The alignment I was quoted was $89.95.  Fair enough.

Two hours later the service guy calls back with a laundry list of items that MUST be done because he says my vehicle is unsafe to drive.  The estimate was $3200.00!!  Along with the requested alignment, I was told I needed a new steering stabilizer $400, new engine seals $1020, new axle seals $512, new pinion seals $237, new front brakes $200 and on and on.  What?!

The huge red flags were that I needed a road balance for $100.  I immediately called Discount Tire, as they do all my tires, and asked how much a road balance is...$8 per wheel.  Airpark Jeep also said I needed a front and rear differential fluid change.  I had just had a front and rear diff fluid change two weeks ago!

The end result is that I walked away $119 in the hole for a list of "needed" services.  I have no idea if any of these item are legitimate or not and even if some of them are, I know I would be getting completely hosed on the price.

Thanks for confirming all the other horrible reviews Airpark Jeep.  You have confirmed to me you are crooks and taught me a $120 lesson.

BEWARE.  FIND ANOTHER SERVICE CENTER OR MECHANIC.

PS. I walked around their lot for two hours looking at new cars while I waited.  Not once did someone ask if they could help me or if I was interested in a new or used car.  Says to me that their sales department is just as incompetent as their service department.

*UPDATE* - After reading my Yelp review, Mark, the Service Director called and invited me to bring my Jeep back and go through another inspection with me personally.  While I appreciate the follow up and willingness to provide in-depth explanations of the suggested repairs, first impressions are hard to get over.  I am getting a second opinion by an independent mechanic and we'll see how the diagnosis compares.  If the second opinion lines up with Airpark Jeep's suggestions, I'll certainly revise the review.Things have gone down hill...I used to LOVE living here!  It now takes at least 2 weeks to get anything fixed!  I'm on day 17 of NO disposal!  They used to fix things in 1 -2 days...not anymore.We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's "Top Docs" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended.I really want to like this place. I love the location and they've done a beautiful job with the space. But I've been here 3 times now plus had takeout once and every time - regardless of how busy it is - the service has sucked. And the food is too mediocre and too overpriced to make up for slow, inattentive, unenthusiastic service. Sorry.worst Verizon store everIt's a great place for rolling up your garage, tuning your cars, and trading engine fixing tips in loud voices all night long!  And welding on a Sunday evening! Actually, it's a nightmare for anybody who lives around it and isn't interested in this culture of male bonding. I will be so happy to move away from my town home in Pepperwood next door, only because I will escape my proximity to those in Alta Ravenwood. It's that bad.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  If I could give them less than a star, I would!

I purchased Groupons for this place.  I get there and the owner was SO RUDE!  They had screwed up my reservation and she kept telling me I cancelled my own reservation.  I had all the email confirmations on my phone and tried to have her look at them and she sat there and argued with me for like 10 minutes.  I explained to her that I had taken a half day off work to come to get a mani/pedi, and the massage was just an extra and her reply was "Well, I don't know what to tell you, I sent my nail tech home because you cancelled your reservation!"  I was dumbfounded!  I could NOT believe the treatment!  I asked her if she could see if she could get the nail tech back and she said she would right away, but then went back to typing!  Not calling the nail tech!  I kept asking the people if she called the nail tech back and they acted like I couldn't even hear them and asked her and her reply to them was "No, haven't had a chance to call her yet".  Then they stuck me in some sort of half assed relaxation room for what seemed like 45 minutes (I was the ONLY customer in the whole place by the way).  Then they FINALLY were able to unbusy themselves enough to do a massage.  (Which the massage therapist WAS wonderful by the way - she was the only good thing about this whole horrible place).  Then again at the end, they completely rushed me out, never even offered % off future services, never even said SORRY!    I am requesting a refund from Groupon for the rest of the deals I bought for this horrible place.  You pay money to get pampered, not be treated like crap.  I would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE from the OWNER!!!Let our reservation go for my new bride on our wedding weekend that we reserved several months in advance and re-confirmed last weekend. Not impressed that we lost our booking without our awareness last night before we checked in because a "large party" came. Interesting that our booking meant nothing.Very bland and very overpriced. Would not recommend this place. 

The service took FOREVER (20mins and you pay at the counter) and the food was entirely trying to be too trendy and lacked in all aspects.

Pass.The food here is bland and the quality is shoddy. For 20 something I expected much better. 

We came here for lunch, and I tried some of the Italian food and Asian food. The food was bland, it tasted like poorly microwaved food. Sure there is a lot of variety, however, to my taste buds everything tasted bland and salty (especially the soups).

Bottom Line: Skip this buffet and go somewhere else.5 star hotel with 1 start service.  Got a handicapped room because we arrived late.  The shower has only curtain and the bathroom was flooded after taking just one shower.  Asked the housekeeping and was told that it was a room for handicapped!!  Called the front desk and wouldn't switch room until next morning.  Finally got room switched at 1:00 am in the morning.  The maid didn't clean up the room thoroughly, and would not provide extra soap.  Would never stay there again.REVIEW OF EVENT HELD AT COSMO NOT A REVIEW OF THE HOTEL


We attended your New Years Eve Skating rink only to be totally disappointed and when I contacted your events department via email I received no reply... please see my email below hopefully I can get some kind of reply now...

Your event at the ice rink was EXTREMELY disappointing. For $160.00 a ticket I would have expected that your event be fully thought out ahead of time and set up flawlessly. We were expecting to see and hear the Bruno Mars concert. One it finally came on at 11pm (no one could give us a definite start time) it was only on the screen for not even 10 minutes before the audio feed went out and they were not able to get it back. We stood and waited hoping that the feed would come back but it never did someone finally decided it maybe a good idea to just put regular music back on so we weren't waiting in silence. 

This was a HUGE  disappointment considering this is LAS VEGAS and everyone is paying top dollar to have a fun safe New Years.Went through a process of getting 3 bids for a move to Reno. Aaction Movers (aka United Van Lines) were the highest coming in $2900 more than the other two bids. We went with Atlas until they told us at the last minute that they had made a mistake and it would be an additional $1640 (ouch) so we went to the next low bid Allied.  Lo and behold at the final hour they found an error and also added $1437 (ouch again) We finally went back to United and said that if they could meet our time schedule we would go with them even though their price was still higher. Couldn't believe when I got a call from United saying they couldn't move us because they were not authorized to move within the state (only Las Vegas) Does any moving company know what they are doing??? Feel like I have been dealing with some very shady used car salesmen.Fees! Fees! Fees! Don't sign up for this card. They will charge you a fee for opening the card. They will charge you a fee for authorized user. They will charge you a fee for the "premium design" of the card itself. And, they will charge you a fee to pay the fees online! I would give them zero stars if I could!Upon arrival I was approached and put on a "waiting list". Looked at the phone I wanted for upgrade and took a seat. Then I was approached again and said thank you for your patience it will be thirty minutes. 1 and a half hours later we still sat on this orange bench with no back rest. They have two people working and they are both talking it up about some random crap.  How about you make a sell then move on instead of talking to some old mothers trying to get there phone numbers even though they provided them to you upon approach. Ok so now we attempt to leave the store cause I'm tired of a waiting for a phone and find this location decides to conduct illegal business practices and locks every single exit door making it impossible for us to leave on our own will. Once we pushed the door this Asian dude that works there stops talking to the moms and says O I can unlock it for you. Not a o I will be right with you or sorry for the wait but a I'll unlock the door for you. This place is negative stars. I will now cancel my phone and go to Verizon!Food was really greasy, and the carne asada was horrible, I don't recommend this place at all.PoS is by FAR my FAV sub place- BUT we went at 6:30pm & it looked closed (half the lights off, mats up, chairs upside own on the tables, and no employees inside) but the sign said they closed at 8! The door was open, the bell rang when we came in, still no one came out- waited another 30 seconds and said "hello! Anyone here are you open?" Girl comes outta the back to take our order, then a male employee comes out of the back and says , "hey baby, I'm gonna - blah blah blah" eeeeyeah more like Port of Sex! Gross! At least she wore gloves making my sandwich. Oy !I  been threading for several years. Just recently I decided to start going to this eyebrows r us because the one on flamingo and eastern was quite a drive. This is probably the the fourth time I use them. This is the last time. The woman that took care of me was extremly rough. It felt like she took sandpaper to my eyebrows by the time I got off the chair both of my eyelids were bleeding. This person was unprofessional and rude. I have never had that kind of experience at any threading place. Today my brow line is swollen and hurts to the touch. To make it worse when I spoke my mother about it she described the same treatment the last time she went as well. I will never go to this place again. To the woman that did my eyeborws: I hope that some kind of happiness seeps back into your miserable life. No one should live with that kind of anger.Worst great clips location I've ever been to! Don't even waste your time coming here. I made the mistake on coming here for convenience. I regret that decision and wish I drove a little farther to the flamingo location. I tipped the lady cause I felt bad for her, not for doing a good job. Never again will I return! The customer service sucks, they all have attitude which makes me question why they are working in this industry. And the lady that cut my hair did a horrible job.Disgusting!! Ordered a pizza from here for delivery and it had a hair!! Called and spoke to Daniel the manager he seemed like it didn't matter (apparently these people do not wear hair nets) and was only going to replace one of the pizzas we order. Then when asked to credit our account and forget the whole thing he CHARGED us again!! Horrible horrible horrible!! Never again!!So my mom recently moved from a rental into a home she bought. Her landlord got this company to handle everything and they have been a nightmare. It's apparently a family owned business, which should mean they should take things seriously but the way they have handled things so far tells me they don't.
First off they never return your calls. EVER. They scheduled a walk through date two weeks prior to the very date they wanted. A week later they called to tell us that the guy can't do that date because he's "going to be on vacation and won't be back until the first of the next month. And then he can do it after the first." So, no real date there.
Next they tell my mom she HAS to leave the lights in her name until the walk through is done, which they have no date for.
Finally I went by the old house and noticed, low and behold, the lights are on. The next day? Still on. They just left them on and never told my mom, who has been calling them for the past week with NO answer. Now her landlord is trying to get everything in his name, and apparently they aren't being much help to him either. 
These people really waste your time and never get back to you.Good selection of scrubs. With that being said- I was in a hurry on the way to work about a month ago- purchased a couple pairs of scrubs without trying them on.. I travel and finally got back into town. Came to exchange my size because XS was too small! They only do exchanges after 14 days?!? What kind of crap is that?? Not coming here again.Went to this store today to return a product that was past the 14 day return policy... I was on the 15th day. I had called and let them know that I was going to be a day late due to it being on Thanksgiving. They said it was fine and will help me out.  Got there and was past on to the Manger who's name is Anibal Culk,  he is the most unprofessional and unethical Manger I have ever dealt with, he is rude,  big headed and had the biggest power trip ever.  Told me to go sell my product On Craigslist and refused to give me the return after being told I could.  He then continue to make comments, so I went to call AT&T customer service and requested their service, they gladly went and accepted my return and will issue me a full refund. When he could have done it himself but refuse to service cause He had to be right and I was wrong. So who ever made this  a manager for this store needs to Re evaluate him and send him back to a customer service program where he needs to learn to listen to the customer and get off of his high horse. Management position.I only give this one star because they charge $25 for a haircut.  This is in Henderson. .not in Las Vegas and they are asking for $25 like they on the strip ...Heckkk no.Two words: Chile relleno. 

Three more words: With the seeds?! 

The order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. 

It has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.

However, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. 

Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.

History was already "meh," and now #lunchfail. Potential just doesn't cut it.Nail service Sucked! Came in 7/8/14 I have two weddings to attend to and I need something that will last long so specifically said I wanted color acrylic because it last longer and she puts plain acrylic with gel color over it and said this is what I asked for? Then I asked to go really thin and seem like she was getting upset because I kept saying how I wanted my nails? Then the health department came in and didn't even say excuse me I'll be back she just picked up and left. So I ask the guy there if someone else that can continue because I have to be at work and he pretended to get her. He had no client so he could have at least continue my nails. After 10min she came back didn't say sorry she jus continue in a rush! She did my nail so fast it looked like she rushed it everyone I showed my nails to said the same wasn't even even! Never again will I come to this
 place! Dazzling nothing!My husband and I have eaten here three times - the first is what brought us back and the food and service was great.  The second time we ate with another couple and we are all very patient customers until the service took forever and we noticed many of our items were not coming (we did all you can eat).  After you asked for something that hasn't come to the table be prepared for the servers to snob you the rest of the time you are there and pretty much throw the food on your table. We thought this was an isolated incident and maybe it was just a rough day for them - it was lunch time and kind of busy.  

It was our third and FINAL time eating here yesterday and what should have been no more than a 45 minute dinner turned into well over and hour and a half.  There were only 4 tables being served - one table of 6 adults.  Seemed like an average dinner time - so tell me why my husband had to get up to ask to be able to order more (all you can eat) and he had to stand up again to inquire about the orders that weren't coming.  After that -- HIS water was refilled and mine was left a third full, no smiles no words to ask how everything is going, no apologies for the HORRIBLE service, and again the food was just being dumped on our table.  

If you dine here just hope you're the only table and that they're in a much better mood than usual.Food was terrible my order was way wrong,  service was terrible & it took forever to get our food! Will not go back and do not recommendDecided to try this place after reading reviews. The service was horrible. Took forever to order food and they didn't even care to bring us utensils or plates. We ordered the crab cake sliders and the lobster rolls. The food wasn't good at all. The crab cake sliders tasted horrible and the lobster was too chewy. Avoid this place if you are looking for good food. The food is totally not worth the money.Slow!  and not worth the waitIf you love waiting this is the shuttle for you... Add another 40 minutes to your travels. This shuttle bus is ridiculous waiting and waiting is the game. Don't patronize this people - not a good start to your Vegas funI wish there was a way to give zero stars.  Went here with a group of friends and the staff refused to give us an additional chair despite the fact that there were several open chairs throughout the restaurant.  When I finally went to grab an open chair the host literally pulled the chair out from under me.  I have never been treated so bad in my life. 

Rude staff. Will never go here ever again.1/2 star. Max. I have been to different locations of this chain.  My friend, a University of Phoenix graduate, made reservations here for 12:30 Saturday 5/4 immediately following the ceremony.  A portion of our party arrived early and proceeded to order cocktails, a few apps, etc. Upon the rest of the party's arrival, the service remained decent. It wasn't until we were ready to order and notified the server as such...that our order was not taken for an additional 15-20 minutes.  She instead proceeded to other large party to take their order. Once we finally got our order in...we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly an hour (if not more by some of our party's calculations) for our food. My husband met us for lunch from the other side of town and needless to say...he had to take his food to-go in order to make it to work on time. They did comp his meal entirely as was expected at this point.  Darrell (the so called GM) apologized and made somewhat of an attempt to right the situation with free COLD appetizers prior to the meal arriving and at the end of it giant cotton candy served in large martini style glasses followed by a piss poor dessert of rock hard crumbly brownies. Sorry, that doesn't remedy the situation.

A portion of our meals were comped and rightfully so.  I can understand that they got slammed after graduation...but know your area...and know that there is a COLLEGE GRADUATION right next door to your restaurant!  Getting "slammed" is not the guests fault...it's YOUR fault for not staffing appropriately.  When I look around the restaurant and see your hostesses gabbing and standing around while our table fills up with empty and NON-REFILLED glasses and dirty appetizer plates, maybe they need to be trained to do a little bussing as well...i mean, you're ''slammed" right? All hands on deck?  I guess not.

I will never return to another Saddle Ranch... anywhere...ever. My guess is that many others will not either as this place will not remain open if this is how it's operated. Horrible.You would think that a Starbucks located in an airport would be more customer focused, extremely disappointed. Drink is terrible and this was after it was remade (which I had to pay for) and I had a rude barista.Ghetto white trashy bar. First time here and my car was broken into.Be aware! Never ever rent a car from this location!! their employees are thieves!!! I have never been so sure of myself that I accidentally left my shoes under the car seat, called their lost and found but said they were closed on weekends. So I called back on a monday but by that time they said they rented the vehicle to others already and no shoes were found. So either the employee that cleaned the car stole my shoes or they simply did not follow company procedure to fully inspect the vehicle before renting it back out again.  Terrible customer service and very bad management! They need to do a better background check on some of their employees. Something needs to be done about this.....zero stars if  I couldVery disappointed in this place.  Was told they had very good mexican food.  We ate here last week and have to say that we didnt like it at all.  The messed up the order a few times and then the food was not much better than taco bell.  Definitely not authentic food.  We will not be going backOne year ago, I would have rated the place a four out of five.  Since that time, the staff has gone straight to crap.  Front desk girls are typically either rude or indifferent and some of the trainers are jerks.  Also, as another individual mentioned, the towels they switched to are cheap and wouldn't dry off a 90 pound female.  The showers and men's locker room have always been relatively gross, so that hasn't gotten worse over the last 12 months, but it hasn't gotten better either.  

After they went to the 19.99/month plan (around the first of the year), they completely oversold their membership.  So, not only is it impossible to maneuver the locker room, it is also now impossible to manuever the weight room.  Not to mention, if you plan on incorporating bench work or squats into your workout, you can count on waiting for a bench or the SINGLE squat rack.

Lastly, the clientele of this gym is weak.  I've never seen so many fake hardos in my life.  Guys wearing sunglasses while they work out, etc., etc.

Anyway, the last straw was today when I had to wait for a locker to open up.  You must be kidding me, Gold's Gym.  Cancelled this afternoon and will be taking my money to Lifetime.I really really wanted to like this place. I moved downtown this past month, and this place seemed ideal for me. But the management of this place CLEARLY does not want my business. 

First time I went was last week. I wanted to activate my 7 day VIP pass. I didn't print out the receipt, but I had a copy on my iphone, so I thought it was OK. They made me wait 20 minutes at least to see the manager (fail #1). The guy (Ryan or Brian or whatever), gives me the tour, and brings me into his office, trying to sell me the plans. It all seems OK, and I am interested, but then I tell him I want to do the 7 day VIP pass first. He's like "You need to print it out". I'm thinking, c'mon, but I give him the benefit of the doubt--I figure there's a bar code or a confirmation number on the form, which explains why they need a printed copy. So I go home, print it out, and I realize THERE'S NOTHING ON THE PAPER -- no confirmation number, no bar code, not even my full name! WTF, why couldn't he just give me the 7 day pass when I was there in person? (Fail #2) 

Ok, I was pissed enough that I started looking hard at their competitors. They were all too far, or too expensive. So after letting a week go by, I'm figure I'm willing to give them a second chance. I figure the manager's probably a douche, but I can live with that. 

So, I go in today, ready to activate my 7 day pass (which I printed out). Again, they have me wait 20 minutes to see the manager, even though I had already filled out the registration form last time (they make me fill it out again) (fail #3). Finally, I see another saleslady (not the manager), and she seems nice. But gives me the same sales pitch (which I already had the first time) and--here's the killer--she asks me to pay for a 1-year membership BEFORE I get to activate the 7 day pass. 

Think about that for a second. I need to pay for a 1 year membership before I get to do my free 7 day trial! Holy fuck! (FAIL #4). Jesus Christ, these clowns REALLY don't want my business. And to top it off, the pass they give me isn't really a VIP pass, it's just a plastic card with a barcode, it doesn't include the parking validation, so when I go home, I get dinged $6 for parking (Fail #5). 

Seriously, dear Gold's Gym management: get your shit together! For the rest of you, I strongly recommend finding a gym that actually values your patronage. Gold's Gym ain't it.What a disgrace!

The worst service ever. The waiter was lame, rude and with an attitude. 

The food was pretty bad, overpriced (even for free would be too much for this horrible place). The decor is lame, the tables are smaller than a stool and so on.

They use plastic silverware and plates (which I guess is for safety purposes) but there are so many other plastic paper options than the ones they use.

I wrote in the bill a note about the lame service and the server instead of being apologetic or trying to understand what happened (he might be so dumb and arrogant not to know that he did everything wrong) he was all mockery and said "goodbye" with an sarcastic tone.

They are lucky to be at the airport, this s@#t hole wouldn't last a month in the real world.

Don even wast your time.Being in all elements of the industry for quite awhile it's been years since I've written a zero as a tip. I also concede being a bar owner myself I feel uncomfortable with writing a negative revue on yelp but....

I've been here about 4-5 times in the past year and I've always had amazing service sitting at the bar. As of tonight, 6-01-12, the service was absurdly bad. I don't blame the personality of the bartender, he seemed friendly enough, yet he was just not meant to be behind the bar. You can't take someone who just got their ABC bartending certificate and plop them behind the bar on a Friday night and expect good service. 

Hopefully they will get their shit together because the chef is pretty good and HRH is short on good, informal restaurants.All the other reviews for Moo seem positive so maybe we just caught them on a bad day, but safe to say we shall not be going back! We'd decided against Circle further down the street as all the condensation on the windows made it look a bit sweaty but with hindsight, condensation = lots of people = popular. Anyway, I digress. 

So we ended up in Moo which has slightly quirky decoration; the highlight (or should that be lowlight?) was a perspex box with a display made from children's farm animals ('Moo' - I get it!) which may have been hilariously ironic when placed there but over the years has become dusty and just a bit grubby. A couple of sad little cows have also bitten the dust so it's actually just a box with some jumbled toys in it.

Anyway, we only wanted drinks and I ordered hot chocolate. We'd been out for a walk and it was freezing so I was really looking forward to a steaming mug with, hopefully, some whipped cream and possibly even a marshmallow or three. I was gutted when not only did I not get any of these hot chocolate accessories but my 'hot' chocolate was more like 'luke warm at best' chocolate. My friend ordered milkshake and was excited by the fact that Moo proclaimed on the menu that it was made with Luca's ice cream. How could it fail?! By grinding ice cubes into it, not ice cream, that's how. Meanwhile, the boyfriend and friend No2 sat sipping tea and looking smug as we exclaimed with dismay over each fresh disappointment.Got the Groupon for my Mom. $90 for 5 windows on her old Range Rover. There are a total of 7 windows that need tint. Groupon listing states "Lifetime Warranty." She shows up on time for the appointment and has to wait for 20 mins. During the consult, the tech is busy answering the phones and talking to the people calling instead of taking care of the customers he has standing in front him. We knew about the extra windows and that there would be an additional charge for them. They wanted an additional $90 for 2 tiny vent windows and 2 windows in the back that were no bigger than than the door, side windows. 

After the upsell spiel, we were told that the Groupon tint only has a one year warranty and the tint probably won't last that long. 

DO NOT waste your time with these people. Horrible customer service and dishonest business practices.All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.on strip prices, should have on strip service! easy enough right? I gave the one star, so I wont have to get into talking about how the service was. "Angela" the girl that helped me, was; sorry totally clueless, Learn how many ounces your burgers come in. its not so hard, ask your chef, or your manager, eye ball it im sure you serve it hella times in one day. Ok maybe im being unfair with the one star, but this is my yelp review. 

order:  wagyu burger with  swiss and maple wood beacon with the specification of "rare" please, and the black truffle oil french fries.  

25 minutes later my burger comes out looks delicious, The buns looked like they were glazed with love and passed though a line of inspectors for flaws, my cheese is yellow, I didnt know swiss came in cheddar! my burger pattie, very well done. 

I wait patiently for "Angela" and as she comes to my table with a distraught look on her face. I calmy explain that I ordered a "rare" burger, at this point she doesnt know how to respond to me. I explain myself very respectively, and so while I wait for the awkward silence, she says to me " well we can fire up another one, But we would have to charge you for it."  she saw my expression change even before she finished her last word. (awkward moment)  she grabs my plate and shows the gentleman who looks to be a manager, being kind and  understanding, he asked to have another burger re-fired , at this point, im knawing away at my truffle oil garlic french fries, and they are good, but first off, Ive never met anyone who thought truffle oil had any sort of aromatic value, and I understand this is a fusion restaurant, and Im assuming black truffle oil and wagyu gave them the $$. Well all in all my service was bleh, My burger, even after it was re-fired, bleh, and the $$, I couldve easily gone somewhere else and then go to another. Anyways the likely hood of me going back is slim, But everyone deserves a second chance.I do NOT recommend this moving company! I scheduled my move for a 5000 sq ft house and hired 3 trucks along with 6 men to start at 7 am sharp as it was a big job. I verified this information with the office twice during the week of our scheduled move. I was assure that they would be on time, I even explained to her that we lived out a bit so they would need to account for that to be there on time. At 7:15 no one had arrived or called, at 7:30 I called the office and got a voicemail (it was Sunday).  At 7:40 I got a call from the driver who said truck #3 alternator went out but that truck #1 and 2 were on their way and the 3rd would be there by the time they were ready to load it. They said they would be there in 30 minutes, 45 min later we get another call that truck #2 had a flat tire! At this point we have still not heard from office and tell driver that we need yo speak to manager/owner someone about this! Finally we get a call that they are renting uhaul trucks and will be there soon. One truck shows up with 4 men and they want contract signed that states hourly rate for 6 men and 3 trucks, mind you there is only 1 truck and 4 men. I say no and he says they can't start the job. This is now 9:30 am! We tell him we need to speak to Mohammed (owner) who is supposedly on his way to our house, he tells them to start the job without signature. 
Once he arrived he gave us 2 hours of work for free and the third truck finally showed up. I was thankful they had to rent 2 trucks because the first one that showed up had painted over graffiti on one side, it was so rundown I was afraid to transport my belongings in it not to mention how embarrassing it was to have that pull up in our neighborhood!  
The men's appearance was far from professional, I was hesitant to even let them stay.  They brought me 1 broken wardrobe boxes when I said I would need at least 4 and did not protect the floors very well where they were dollying items out, no regard was given to boxes marked as "fragile".
I returned to the old house that evening to find random things left behind, things that I told them were ours and needed to go. It took me two additional trips in my truck to get all the items!
Moving day is stressful enough for homeowners that's why we enlist the help of  moving companies, waiting for over two hours in the morning was completely unacceptable! Your trucks are your main piece of equipment how do you not keep them in good working order, you didn't know about the alternator?!  We were lied to continually about their excuses for not being there on time in the morning.  
By the end of the job they got sloppy leaving boxes they broke from rough handling in the middle of hallways and just unloading and shoving things in places. As I unpacked I found several broken items, they also broke several items in the unloading process.
This was by far the worst moving experience I have ever been through.All my friends and I travelled to Vegas for a bachelor party.  Ended up being a puke fest thank to STanK.  

After spending $160 each on our meals, we all took a limo to the nightclub.  Soon thereafter, I felt so sick that I asked one of the guys to get me an ambulance.  Long story short, I spent my whole night violently puking the nasty food.  The next day I called my friend to apologize for the abrubt departure and he told me how he and several other guys vomitted all night.  

Wasted vacation thanks to this dirty restaurant.  I appreciate YELP for having such a service so restaurants like this can get exposed.  

Take the $2,000 plus you made that night on cleaning up your act.  Disgraceful.This review has to do with just trying to give STK business.  I've being trying to reach them for 2 days to book a private room for 12 people.   When restaurants are hot and booked every night they think they are untouchable.  This attitude/arrogance is pathetic!  They will not always be on top and when their appeal declines people will remember how they were treated.  Good Luck STK!This rating is specifically for the planned course for our bachelorette party. 13 women, $2200, $170 per person. Many times people give bad reviews because a place is expensive. I didn't come to Vegas to save money, so that is not my gripe. The majority of us were doctors, lawyers, and those in the medical profession. We came here to throw down :) I am actually so surprised that the food was this bad. Just because our service came "family style" doesn't mean they should skimp on portions or quality (ask Robert Irvine on Dinner Impossible). This is what we all got for $2200, and I'm NOT kidding!: 

1. Bread (was the best thing I had here)
2. Soggy overdressed ceaser salad
3. ONE cocktail shrimp (ONE!!!! not a few, not several, but ONE!!!)
4. ONE lobster ravioli (ONE!!!, the size of a regular ravioli, 2 x 2). I didn't eat this one because I am allergic to lobster, so I gave mine to my friend. So she had TWO.
5. One small lump Mac and cheese (Not the good kind with the real cheese and baked crust on top, the kind you would get at a buffet)
6. One lump Creamed spinach. No real comments, it's creamed spinach.
7. Risotto swimming in what tasted like Campbells cream of chicken soup.
8. And the star of the night, the main course...dry skirt steak, not seasoned. Good thing the bride doesn't eat beef! (A lot got thrown away, no one wanted to eat much of it)
9. One glass of champagne

6 of us got an extra cocktail (well vodka and club soda for me, very small glass, not those large tumblers you get at the club). I felt like I crashed my grandfather's assisted living buffet dinner. This food was not only extremely expensive, but it would have been a rip off even if it was a cheap meal at any old restaurant. SHAME ON YOU STK! Giving us this horrible memory of our darling friend's celebration dinner. Of course she didn't complain, she is a beautiful person. 

We were all crammed in a table that wasn't meant to fit 13, we had reservations, but we were 30 minutes late because it takes a long time for 13 women to get out of the room (Know what I mean?), but geez, hold our table for pete's sake, and don't let us wait 1 hour to sit down. They ended up bringing this table from storage and making room in the bar area for us, one hour later when they could have done this from the get go when they saw their restaurant was full. There were no serving utensils with any of our platters, so we used our forks and spoons to dish. Not clean or convenient. We were all good friends, so this is the least of my gripes. 

Did we have fun? Yes, the music was all 80s, and catered to our 30 and up crowd. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the next table of 40 and overs doing the running man and cabbage patch to tunes from Tag Team and Grand Master Flash. That part was amazing. Kept my mind off being continuously tempted to speak to the manager about his horrible meal, and that was BEFORE the bill came. The service was great, but didn't make up for the horrible horrible horrible food to warrant even a second star. I had to throw that in one more time, as I get angrier the more I write.

Will I come here again, maybe. So I can understand why people gave it such good ratings, since they most likely did not order a planned course meal. For anyone thinking of having a planned meal here for large party, or possibly pre-wedding festivities, DON'T. Order a "normal" meal, like normal people do. That's what we should have done.I finally get to vent on how much of a massive shit hole this "festival" is. Worst pizza I ever had, which was comparable to bad microwavable pizza (this might be what they actually used). I also got the sausage in a dry old bun, what? no condiments?! No grilled onions or bell peppers?  Why did I pay $12 for that turd in a bun? At least the Italians serving the food were friendly... actually it was quite the opposite. Screw this place, I'm going to the Greek Food Festival.Between the bland chicken, horrible tasting condiments, and the FAKE machaca. This has been by far the WORST "Mexican" restaurant. I don't understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business!?! Machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled. Good thing I don't live around here, I had found this on Yelp from a Dr. visit.This started out as a 5 star review a few hours ago. Service was fantastic, sandwiches delicious. I got the buffalo chicken my husband the bac-hammon. Within 2 hours we are both sitting here very sick. Something was contaminated! The only two items that were the same on our sandwiches were mayo and provolone. So it was that or someone failed to wash their hands. Sorry, but after this incident i don't think we will be returning :(All i wanted was for my bangs to be trimmed not butchered!!! I will now have to wear my bangs pinned back everday till they grow back. Originally she said it would be $10 to trim my bangs....but when she saw how unhappy i was she lowered it to $5!! She should have paid me since now i have to go buy headbands!!!!the place smell so bad with smokers,we have to leave right away.I started off here early int the night to originally meet up with a fairly large group of people for the UFC night. We got there early to ensure a table for the over 10 people group I was with. At first it started off alright. I'd have to wait 10 minutes after my beer was gone to see the waitress who eventually forgot my beer, then came back with it another 20 minutes after she realized she forgot it. I was trying to be understanding since our group was so large and everyone was ordering drinks and appetizers.
Then, the crowd got large. I was annoyed to not see our waitress for over 30 minutes and so I went to the bar. There were 50 guys at the bar and they all were served before me. It was more than frustrating because I was there waiting before most of them.
Later in the night, I managed to run into an old coworker and hung out with him and a group of whom I'd call fairly attractive young guys.... they got service every 10 minutes or less. It was insane! My former coworker was ordering cheap beer and no food and managed to get better service than the group of people I was with ordering premium drinks and appetizers! Apparently it takes having a penis to get service around there!! WTF?!
The only reason why I'd CONSIDER coming back to this place is because I found out (2 hours after being here because the waitress never told us specials) Coors Lights were $2.... Guys obviously love going there because the waitresses are fairly attractive, but the bar was a sausage fest, for sure, which normally would be a good thing for a single girl, but good luck getting any form of service!This place I terrible. Terrible customer service, terrible drinks, terrible food. The best thing I ordered was a beer and that probably because they can't mess it up.Grossly over priced! Extremely slow and incompetent. I ordered a tea and my gf a coffee. Simple right. Was out of coffee and who I think was the manager said let me pour you this remaining half a cup to sip while I get you a fresh cup. Then she forgot all about getting a cup of coffee, walked by us several times at the end of the counter before we finally had to stop her and ask about the coffee. She looked at us as if we were crazy so, we had to remind her it was her request we wait until a fresh pot was ready and she would get us a cup. No apology no anything walked away got a cup of coffee and walked backed handed to my gf and without a word walked away. 

If remembering to serving a cup of coffee is that difficult (i watched them make 6 specialty coffee's while we waited for a simple cup of coffee) for the manager to remember she might want to consider a new line of work. 

They don't have to worry about me returning to over burden them this was my 1st and last experience at Sambalatte I will stick with Starbucks or Panera.Ick and Boo!  My two thoughts after bite one of my take-out dinner.  After eating a lot of average Chinese food in Scottsdale, we were excited to try this new place.  When I called to place my order, I was a little shocked to find out that all but one of the entrees listed in the "Vegetable" dinner section contained some kind of meat or fish product.   So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce, and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2, and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived, my dish had no cashew nuts... "Boo", it also had no flavor whatsoever "Ick".  In fact, after taking a few bites, I began to be concerned about the quality of the food, as it was loaded with veggies and sauce, and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away, I didn't want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won't be back.Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.

I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu. 

I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.

The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.

I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.

I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!

Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.

I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.

Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it.Ordered my magazine through them the first time and I got my proof fast.  The images looked a bit cyan and dark so I asked for them to be lightened and for cyan to be taken out.  Got a bit of flack for asking for this but they eventually reluctantly agreed.  Got the magazines and they looked decent but the price is so low because they print on Xerox machines.. Meaning your magazine will look raised like the ink is sitting on top of the page and gloss compared to the paper.  (Also the mag had some streaking in areas)  I went to place my 2nd magazine order and changed my address on file and attached my file to the order and sent it through.  I wait almost a week for a proof and call because i haven't yet recieved it.  The gentleman tells me that they got no file and were waiting on me to send it.  A simple courtesy call could have rectified the situation and saved me a week.  "Hello sir just wondering when we can expect your file?"  So apparently the file I attached didn't attach.  I send the file through a 2nd time on a monday.. wait until thursday and nothing so I call again and they say they are printing it and shipping it AFTER 2 orders that are in front of me (we are talking about a proof not a huge order here) So I'm thinking they forgot about my order and me calling reminded them.  I get a confirmation my proof shipped and it shows my OLD address..  I call and leave a msg (sent an email right after I sent the file through and didn't get a response which is the 4th email since i've been dealing with them that they never responded to) Call again today to see where the proof shipped to and it's my old address.. I ask him if he could send a new proof to my new address and I get his reason why I MESSED UP and ticked the wrong box here or there (When I originally sent the order through I put in all new addresses for shipping and billing so why those didn't take presidence I don't know.. I unfortunately didn't check the confirmation (because I double checked the order before I sent it through and the new address was listed) which is my fault because it listed my old address.  I was interrupted while I told him I just need the proof to the right address by him continuing to tell me what I did wrong.  I said it's not a problem right now lets just work it out and get the ball rolling.  He asked if I wanted a refund.. We are 14 days into the order and I have deadlines and customers who prepayed for their mags so I can't drop this order and find a new printer and set myself back that much time I say just send the proof we'll be all good.  At sometime in this conversation he began to swear because I cut him off in the middle of placing the blame on me for another problem with the order to which I said "if I did something wrong I'm sorry lets just move forward" I get off the phone with the promise of my proof being sent out today. 20 minutes pass and I get an email from another employee with short run and they told me that they don't allow their employees to be verbally assaulted and treated as I treated him.  If anything he cussed at me. I was a bit livid but never made any remarks towards him. I did say I wasn't happy with not having a priority because of the amount of time the order has been pending.  i also cut off his long winded explanation ONCE because I had already heard it before I just wanted to move forward. My order was now cancelled and so was my account.. Wasted my time and they cost me money because my prices were based on their cost of printing.  It really feels like they let some stuff slip through the cracks and they aren't too proactive or customer friendly.  Oh and the first mag was also behind schedule because their "machine broke down" it happens so I didn't care I was nice and accepted the delay.So 1 star..... "Why Sean?, enlighten us" 

Ok, I will. The place is cute, cool 80's theme going on, nostalgia all over. However the "yogurt" isn't yogurt at all, its frozen flavored water stuff, not creamy, not the right consistency or viscosity (been waiting years to use that word). I challenge you to allow a portion of your selection to melt and witness the non yogurt substance at the bottom on your cup. 

"But Sean, did it taste good at least?" ........No. 

I was puzzled when eating it and am puzzled to see reviews praising the quality of the product. But look for yourself (at other reviews) and you'll see I'm not alone in my assessment. 

I love yogurt too, so I'll go elsewhere to get some since this place doesn't carry any. 

***Change the name of the place to "I love flavored slush muck" or just sell hot dogs. Call it "I love yogurt" still but sell hot dogs instead, that way you'll be selling something not indicated by the name sarcastically and not because you're cheapos

Ownership feel free to contact me for further suggestions, I have this notepad I've been writing stuff in since 02.Bad pizza, worst service of any restaurant I have ever been in. If you want to watch the employees watching football this is the place to goIn writing this review as I'm waiting for my food. We've been waiting foreverrr wtfff. We ordered our food 50min ago and only 1 out of 4 people have gotten their food. When I eat Vietnamese food, I don't wait any longer than 10min for my food to come out. Maybe the heat is getting to everybody here...Do not recommend.  Got a hamburger and a pulled pork sandwich. Pork was cut chunks with BBQ sauce dumped on top. Bun fell apart when trying to pick it up.  Hamburger tastes like a frozen meat bi-product with no frills.   Menu was not BBQ type foods and nothing really seemed edible.   Halfway through our food my son found hair in his fries and under his burger.   Not impressed and didn't even want to give it a star... Star basically is because they are cheap but its definitely you get what you pay for. Cheap, tasteless, and unimpressive.Oh boy was this place awful! Went with my mother for lunch, we were both disappointed and hungry when we left.  It took 45 minutes to get soup and sandwiches, the waiter never once checked with us, we never got drink refills, we had to get up and find the hostess to pay the bill.  My mom's grilled cheese was so hard (presumable from sitting under the warmer lights) that it was inedible. The waiter also never brought us silverware!  Again, I had to walk up to the hostess to get some silverware. It was in no way busy so I just don't get it. I had high hopes and the menu "sounded" good but blech.  We never got the chance to even complain since we never saw our waiter again and there was no  management to be seen.  Avoid!!I heard this place had great food and also had food ok for HCG diet. I'm on the diet and my friend isn't so I thought perfect. I try to take my out of town guests to non chain places. We walked in and not another person in the place. the waiter came right over and was very nice. He made recommendations and was very helpful. There is no hcg food and I even called ahead and was told there was. My friend ordered balsamic chicken and didn't like it at all. I ordered berry salad with shrimp. The greens were bitter and limp, the shrimp was so so. I asked to leave the goat cheese off as I hate it. They forgot and put it on and then picked it back off. The whole thing tasted like goat cheese. The waiter asked if I was allergic to it. I should have said yes. I ate the berries and 5 shrimp. It was $16.99 which I think is pricy for lunch. I wouldn't have minded if delicious. I was extremely disappointed. The only positive thing was good service.I had diarrhea for six hours.  Ruined my Friday night in Vegas.This has to be the worst place I've called for delivery. I just called and all I said was, "Do you all deliver to my area?" In a thick accent but also a hint of disconnect in this woman's voice, she says slowly, "where do you live again?." I start Sa.....I'm interrupted with, "Oh sorry we don't deliver there". Really????WOW! Is all I have to say. I have not even got onto my flight yet and I am extremely angry as I write this. 

I booked a flight from LAS VEGAS to LA to visit my girlfriend. The flight was only $100 round trip. 

I went on-line to confirm my flight and check in... I had to pay $10 dollars for a seat both ways- so an additional $20 then to even check my bag as a CARRY ON I had to pay $33 each way so an additional $66 

My $100 flight turned into almost a $200 flight. It would be nice if companies such as CHEAPOAIR or PRICELINE would advise you that when you book with this company that there will be extra fees. 

Also my bags were supposed to be $28 a bag but the on-line system charged me $33. I called SPIRIT (which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number) to ask them why I am paying more money than what is stated. The lady advised me that if I confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting, that I had to pay an additional fee for my bag. 

HOW IS THIS COMPANY STILL IN BUSINESS....? 

I should have paid $150 with SOUTHWEST who I know I can trust. I have been reading all these reviews - and I am so scared to even get onto my flight..... I am not good with rude customer service.. especially when I am already very upset. 

Luckily it is only a 1 hour flight- so I should be okay..... 

If only I would of yelped them prior to booking.... all I saw was CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP rates flashing across the screen... and overlooked and didn't use my YELP. YELP will never fail you, because there are real people with real reviews that you can trust. Next time I will never book anything without reading about it first :(Horrible Luggage Fees. The only free luggage is one small personal item. They charge a minimum of $35 for a tiny carry-on. And it gets even more expensive after that. So if your excited about their cheap flights, unless you plan on flying with only a purse, un-excite yourself. Your flight will cost more if you plan on bringing luggage.

No complimentary drinks.
No complimentary anything.

Uncomfortable seats. 

Customer Service is lacking. 

Status of the flight said "on-time" but it wasn't. 
I understand that every airline has delayed flights, but they could have at least said the flight was delayed.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.Spirit is the worse airline you can go threw to fly anywhere. Going back and forth to Vegas often which is only a hour flight and they can never be on time. Constant delays for numerous hours its ridiculous! They charge a arm and a leg for everything. You have to pay for a seat on top of your ticket plus 45 to check in a bag and its usually 25.. And that's not including they try to charge you to bring a
Carry on bag. Don't give you anything to drink and you have no leg room what so ever. The most low budge airline you can go with. Even if the prices are low it's not worth it book ahead of time with a better airline. I will never again even if the flights are 5.00!!! There HORRIBLE they should be put out of businessIf I can give no stars for this airline company I would. My mother tried to reschedule a flight for her and my father to return to Los Angeles on a red eye. The reason for the rescheduling was due to doctors orders for my fathers discharge extension from ICU at spring valley hospital. After explaining the situation and even attempting to give them a written statement from the doctor this airline company refused to reschedule flight date and give a refund. I hope this company shuts down. Bad pr, bad service, bad policy. Better of flying jet blue or any other airlines if you ask me. In saying that spirit airlines will probably be the most inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.Apparently they don't have room for new customers, but they do have a list of competitors you can have but they don't know how well these guys work so that's really of no use. Sorry you're too busy! I'll find my own company.This was the second time eating at this location and it was absolutely awful. The first time we ordered a deep dish pizza and the stupid delivery boy must have set it funny in his car because all of the cheese and sauce were crammed to one side of the box and there wasn't a scrap left on the actual pizza...gross.  My office used to order from the one on Power for lunch at least once a month and they had the BEST chicken parm I have ever had! This location however, it was not even edible. Instead of an actual chicken breast it was about 5-6 slices of chicken about the size of my finger that were all dried out and mostly burned, also the spaghetti that was in some nasty, watery, marinara soup was burned on the top. How is it possible to burn spaghetti?! Went right I the trash.Very dissatisfied......althought I am a single and its not hard to get a seat in the bar....I came in sat down and a nice waiter did ask me what I wanted to drink....served ne my first beer without asking if I acted to taste test it first....another weird thing about this guy is he smiled a lot...maybe too much and failed to ask me if I was eating. I flagged a waitress down about 15-20 minutes later and ordered a burger well done....when it came it was medium rare....the mash potatoes are supposed to taste like garlic....they didn't.....atmosphere is typically bar....I do not think I will return.This is the first place I ever walked out on... My girlfriend and I ordered a few things and noticed little fruit flies flying around... I lost my appetite as soon as a couple landed on my food.. I showed our waiter (young gentlemen) the issue, and he knew exactly what was going on so he notified a manager.. The manager comes we show her the little fruit fly and tells my girlfriend "oh that's just garlic honey" are you kidding me?? When does garlic move?? Anyways this place is ridiculous I also ordered a boba drink and the boba was rock hard. Also I feel bad for the young waiter who had to act like nothing was wrong because in sure the manager told him to act like itDon't bother going here to watch the Soccer game the whole bar has already been reserved we all left...very disappointed...This place wasn't very good with the old owners and the new owners haven't done any better.  It's a bad location so has to survive off a very small breakfast and lunch crowd which in turn means they have to cut corners.

I think they need to ditch the Zeez's grill and start a bad-a$$ hole in the wall taco/burrito shop which is desperately missing from downtown Phoenix.  Chipotle ain't cutting it.i've been going to canteen for 3 years now. recently they introduced the 10$ minimum on credit/debit cards. however, i honestly forgot my card at canteen yesterday  while bar hopping on mill and when i went back to get my card, i saw a $6.00 charge. when i questioned the charge, both the bartenders at the back bar and the manager say " im sorry but thats a credit card charge because its a $10 minimum we cant do anything about that sorry". i tried to reason with them saying "im sorry i did not know, but ive been coming here for 3 years now", however, both the bartenders respond "im sorry honey, but the $10 minimum has been going on since we opened". i tip very well when i am at canteen at over %25, but i guess non of them care. the manager just stood next to me  without saying a word just looking at me. he goes "sorry, this is how it is". my advice is go to canteen to have a good time, but please please please do not buy a drink at all. they will rip you off, go to cue club across the street to buy a drink (5$ long islands). canteen is trying to take advantage of robbie's not getting any business.No complaints about the ice cream at this location. The staff is nice and friendly. The problem starts when one tries to get a refund for a canceled cake order paid by credit card. One is told that the staff does not have a code to process the refund. The manager has to contact another institution to process the order and so on and so forth. I had to dispute the charge with my credit card company. I have never had this problem before. So save yourself a meltdown and use cash :)My daughter went for her first time last night to Diva after purchasing through Groupon.  She was told she had to wait until for the previous client to finish. When that client came out she reported the machine was not working properly. My daughter was told she would have to come back the following day, which she did in the afternoon. She got there and was told the computers were not working so had to go to a different location down the street. Upon finishing her tan she came out totally blotchy and speckled. The attendant claimed to have never seen that happen and contacted her manager. My daughter was told to go home and shower to try and wash it off. Sounds to me after reading the previous reviews this is not an isolated incident.  Hoping they can make it right on some level. :(This place stinks.  My friend had her daughter's birthday party here.  It sucks when you pay by the hour and 45 minutes of it is the staff trying to fix the bowling machines.  Not cool.  Plus the lady that runs the bowling center is a huge jerk.  Shouldn't treat people like crap when they are giving you money.  They could have totally picked a different location.  Instead they opted for this place cause it was close to home.  Bad choice. Never again.Went to new Amore Sports Grill with my wife and 3 kids.  My son loves the Amore Pizza in McDowell Mtn Ranch, and thought that this would give us a place for the kids, and mom and dad to have a beer as well.  Packed my pocket with quarters as the kids love video games etc.  On a Friday night there were about 20 ppl. In the bar and a few families in the restaurant.  We sat down ordered a burger, couple pizzas and wings.  Went over to get the kids setup on the video bowling game.  Sat down to drink my beer, when the owner walked over with the kids and said the games are really for adults, that they could finish the game as long as I stayed with them, (video games are adjacent to but not in the bar).  From what I heard they owner(s) were involved with Temple Bar in McDowell Mtn Ranch and did not like the families that came in with kids.  Not sure he/they understand the demographics of the area, pretty easy to understand with the Internet.  

Now obviously this is the opinion of a parent, so let's talk about the food.  The burger was ordered medium temp. came out "dead" done, my wife and I intended to split it, neither us finished our half.  The wings were huge, (bigger than normal) but were really tough and under cooked.  The pizza was mediocre at best 12" is smallest and was basically flavorless and had a huge crust.  

Bottomline if you want a beer and have the time to drive past, Zipps, Temple or Lazy Lizard try this place.  If this were the closest place to eat, get some gas and keep driving, it will likely be better.This is my first Yelp review. As is normally the case with first reviews, the customer is either overjoyed or bummed out. This is of the "bummed out"variety.  I tried A. Sakura tonight for the first time as the location was good and the prices seemed ok, but not THAT much cheaper than their competitors. If they were THAT much cheaper then I would be a LITTLE more okay with the quality. Fact is, for the same money, one could do much much better in Madison. 

The sushi is what I tried and rice is the main problem--FLAVORLESS!  Bland!!  Lacking enough sugars and vinegar to make it even close to what sushi rise should be (I make my own at home btw). And, what flavor there MIGHT have been in my rainbow roll was masked by too much mayonnaise type sauce and eel sauce (which normally isn't even found on a rainbow roll)!  Typical fare, such as tuna rolls and California rolls were also bland, on par with super market sushi. Honestly, if I wanted this quality I should've went to a Target.  Blah!

Look, this is Madison, folks. Muramoto, Takara, etc, all have this place beat by a large margin at similar prices. Step it up A Sakura, or get outta town.  This seems to be a place that I'd find in a small town in rural America, not Madison!Never mind trying this place. I ordered 3 pizzas to go for a poker party at our house in Southern Highlands. At the end of the party we had 2 and half left. We ordered from pizza hut. The crust was stiff and just tasted flat. We had pepperoni at ir appears thay are using inferior products. We need a great pizza place in SH and this place is not it.I learned to love Indian when I loved in London for 10 years.  This place is a train wreck.  It is ABV:   Appallingly Bad Value.  Over 
priced ( they even charge for papadoms!), horriible service and decidedly marginal food.  

We were a party of three.  Only two other tables were occupied when we arrived, although it was almost full when we left.  45 minutes after we ordered the waitress brought our rice.  5 minutes  later, the first entree arrived; ten minutes later, the second arrived: 5 minutes later, the third!  

I ordered lamb vindaloo.  Now vindaloo, by definition, when authentic, is so hot it will take off the top of your head.  But I get it; this is Arizona, were veal is exotic, and so I was not surprised to be asked how spicy I wanted it, on a 1 to 10 scale.  I asked for 8.  The dish I got was a "1" at best.  No spice at all!  the rest of the food was mediocre as well.  and this place is expensive.  Caveat emptor.Nice sales guy, terrible overall experience.   Don't shop here unless you have unlimited patience for delivery.

When checking on delivery time for prepaid order, bed and bedroom furniture, I had to call three times over 5 hours (speaking with them each time) just to get a call back with an estimated delivery day!

Then, when the day came, all furniture cleared from room in preparation for delivery, I call to check on actual delivery time on a Tues. to which they tell me .. it will NOT be delivered this week.

Now I have to move bedroom furniture BACK INTO THE ROOM so the young lad can sleep somewhere tonight and until Mega Furniture can figure out their delivery....  AND they pre-charged me $100 for delivery.

Chris, sorry, you're a very nice sales guy but unless the back office can figure out delivery services, your job will be difficult.I tried. Twice. I just can't do it again.

A large group of us went for Cinco de Drink... err, Cinco de Mayo. Partly because it's Mexican food, partly because of location, and partly (probably the biggest part) because of the specials and opening deals they offered.

The nacho specials weren't bad, but they were short lived. They are not still on the menu. While they were generally tasty, they didn't offer enough of the key ingredients (i.e. meat choices, etc.) and we were digging through the chips to find what we had ordered.

The service was bad. There's no other word for it. It was slow, even with multiple servers watching over our group and others. I had to go to the bar to order drinks more than once.

I spoke with the manager, Amy, about it. She was great helping me set up our large group and after when I talked to her about our experience. She explained the situation (staffing issues, temporary fill-ins). While I found that understandable but not excusable, we discussed the possibility of another try.

That said, a month or so later I went back for a quick dinner in the hope that, outside of the "holiday" crowds, that it would be different.

I was, again, disappointed. I opted for the custom nachos and my guest had the enchiladas. The nachos were small and expensive (I didn't even add meat), the chips seemed stale, and the sauces and salsas seemed as if they'd been left out for a day. Her enchiladas were so spicy as to be almost inedible.

The waitstaff was slow and inattentive, and we had to flag down the waitress more than once. 

We had to bring to the staff's attention that the restrooms hadn't been looked after in some time.

I will not be going back.Yes. I will give you a call after this weekend. I can assure you that was the only food we has in common in a while. We were 5 in the table. Only me and her had the same food. The rest thanksfully didnt get sickMy wife and I went there on Friday afternoon for a late lunch. We were looking forward to trying a restaurant that was new to our neighborhood, with outdoor seating. When we sat down, there were only 4 tables being used. We thought this would mean we wouldn't have to wait long for lunch. We were WRONG! We waited for 15 minutes to get service. It took 25 minutes for them to deliever  2 hamburgers that we paid 12.00 a piece for. The hamburgers were good. They add an additonal 3.00 for a side that, we thought was part of the meal. They didn't tell us there was an extra charge for the side.The menu has a limited selection for entrees. The service was terrrible. It was our first and last experienceI've asked myself each time I've gone here, why did we come here?  The service has always been terrible each time.  It probably is the worst service I have ever experienced  The food is ok, not the best, but tonight it was really greasy.  we had to ask for napkins 3 times and never got any.  There are so many servers but none of them will bother looking in your direction.
I really don't think we will go back again, and I mean it this time.I agree with with Elizabeth E.'s review.  This show does have "cheesy magic/arobatics.. definitely (little kid) orientated." I got the tickets on sale for $10 (@ travelzoo.com.)  Retail is $60 something, i believe. Definitely not worth the full price. The show evolved around 2 Japanese girls that tries to fight an evil character. Throughout the show, there will be magic/arobatics (i.e. escaping from tiny sword stabbed boxes, flying above gravity, and etc..) It doesn't come close to any Cirque de Soleui production!

I would only recommended the show if you have a coupon for $10, and need it as a time filler during your stay in Las Vegas. The show is every night @ 4pm-515ish at the Planet Hollywood. Other than that, I wouldn't suggest you booking it...I had never eaten at Nathan's before and I was really in the mood for a hot dog. Plus, like everyone else says there's not much of a choice when you've reached this stage in the race to your gate. My husband, son, and myself all ordered chili dogs, fries, and a drink. That tallied out to about $26 dollars give or take which is outrageous but not totally unexpected for airport food. After I got the bill and my stroke we sat down and tried to eat this swill. Which is exactly what it is! The cheese for the hot dogs is nacho cheese, is that normal? Is that something that's done in life? Anyway, and the crinkle fries were greasy and totally tasteless. There was nothing at all redeeming about this place. I always try to avoid eating at the airport but if'n I have to it will never be at Nathans Famous Hotdogs. One last thing, who in the heck serves chili dogs but doesn't offer a place to sit?Went there for lunch today. Wasn't that busy. It took forever to order out food, and it took even longer to get it. The service was so bad. Waitress forgot to bring some items and we had to keep reminding here and have us a crappy apology. Good was okay but very expensive. Overall i would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. The service was that bad!!For starters, I love sushi. It's amazing. So when there's a new sushi place that opens up near by I like to give it a go; and seeing as how it was valentines weekend I decided I would take my wife out to dinner for some sushi. We live near by, so I figured we would go to Otaku and see what the fuss was all about. After all, they have pretty decent reviews so far and it looked pretty promising. 

I had the foresight to call ahead because apparently the restaurant was full. I got a reservation for 7:45, showed up ten minutes early and we were seated promptly. The place was packed, the hostess wasn't kidding, they sure were full. It wasn't surprising that it was hard to get a table, because for a decent size restaurant, they have hardly any tables. Probably 70% of the seating is at two giant bars, one is more of a sports type bar with a bartender, and the other is a sushi bar where you can watch the chefs attempt to make sushi (more on that later). The atmosphere of the bar is very nice if a tad to loud. It seems like it can't decide if it wants to be a high end sushi joint, or a sports bar. And the problem is that the restaurant isn't big enough to effectively be both. So you get the dinner seating right next to the sports bar with loud music playing. There is high quality workmanship and very contemporary/modern design elements all around. I shudder to think about how much it cost them to build it, it's beautiful inside. It almost seems like they're trying too hard to be modern however, as they even use IPads for their POS system. Which sounds like a cool idea, but after observing the waitress try to use it for a while I noticed they don't have a cash drawer attached to them, which means they have to ring up the checks, print out a receipt, then walk to wherever the cash drawer is hidden and get the change. They also didn't seem to work with credit cards too well because they were manually typing in a lot of numbers when the cards wouldn't swipe properly.

All of this would be OK if I didn't run into a headache in every other aspect of our first and last visit to Otaku. Our server was Yuko and she did a very poor job. She took our order, brought us some water and ran away. She only returned once to give us refills. She returned really quickly with our tempura appetizer... too quickly in fact, as we learned that she actually stole another tables app... oops. The tempura was pretty good, although it was quite oily. Once we were done with it, we began the wait for our food... and we waited... and we waited... and eventually Yuko came by to tell us that the kitchen is running a bit slow tonight (no shit). That's fine I thought, it happens. Then we saw her socializing with a table full of drunks and wondered if it was actually the kitchen or her that we should worry about. We decided it was her, when we noticed that a table that was seated after us, and ordered after us, got their sushi ten minutes before we did! All this time Yuko was nowhere to be found. In the long run we ended up waiting 30 minutes after we finished our appetizer to get our sushi.  We only ordered two rolls: a California and a Vegas roll. The final nail in the coffin is that the Vegas roll was cold when we got it! It had clearly been sitting out for a good 10-15 minutes before it got to our table as it was room temperature and chewy. Beyond the texture, there was absolutely nothing special about it, certainly nothing to justify it's 9 dollar price. The California roll was just as generic as well. I've had better sushi at Teharu in Tempe, and it's a freaking serve yourself conveyor belt. 

By this point my wife and I were pissed off, so we told Yuko that we were in a hurry and we needed the check. She then gave us the check and never returned. In the ten minutes between getting the check and us walking out cursing the name Otaku, I saw her busy counting her tips and socializing with her table full of drunk customers, who I'm sure she realized were the only people that would be stupid enough to actually tip her that evening.  This place clearly has a lot of kinks to work out, and the lack of stars in this review is all due to Yuko. I don't know if it would be any better with a different waitress, but I don't think i"m going to worry about finding out. There are a ton of choices for mediocre sushi in the valley and I'm past the point of giving places multiple chances to win me over. I'm guessing all the other five star reviews for this restaurant were from people to drunk to notice how bad it actually is.Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!Bad. Bad. Bad. Worst buffet I have ever had. Overpriced and not on par with the rest of our stay at the cosmo. The presentation was great but they should invest more in flavor of food. Not one of the 3 of us enjoyed it. Rather than telling each other to try items on the buffet was good we were all sharing things to say how terrible they were. Don't recommend at all.  The dessert selection looks impressive but there really isn't a lot to offer there. Never againLet me Start,
This was now myfavorite Buffet Since they opened & we are locals. We ate here 20 Times &brought guest from everywhere to eat here. 

Here is my issue

The quality is getting worse from visit to visit. 
Price Increased of course. :-(

Came here for Brunch. Line was 2 min.  Hosts are very nice & attentive. Our waitress was nice too. She dissapeared a few Times but yes Thats Not a Problem. 

But the Food. Almost everything was cold. I Never fill up plates & Walk Around i usually go straight back but evrything was cold. 
Mussels cold, chicken cold, potatoes cold, ...

The choices are very Limited. They dont really fill up. 

Only the Desserts are Good ( choc Lava cake, gelato) evry other cake was too Sweet ( Carrot cake, cheescake) the sweelpotatoe flan was just Bad. 

We ordered OJ & Tea
The Tea used to be Great quality they now suck at Tea. Its coffee flavored tea. Not Even Tea bags. They bring it in the Cup already prepared. 

I will Not go back. Sorry but it Sucks now. :-(Unfortunately the food did not meet expectations. I was excited about the individual dishes but the quality was poor overall. Dishes were not seasoned well and tasteless. The bone marrow bones were dried out. The breakfast buffet was odd. Got there at 8:30am and there were more dinner items then actual breakfast items. Could not help but wonder if it was simply leftovers from the night before. I love a good buffet but this was not.Let Down. 

The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre "tastes" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  

For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.  

**This review is based upon trying the following:
--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)
--When Pigs Fly
--Dan dan noodles
--Lengua tacos
--Pork belly tacos with pineapple
--Carnitas

Can you believe all of this was $100+? Avoid. 

**Disclosure: I am a big Jose Andres fan, live in DC, and eat at all his restaurants.Not worth your money and time. The atmosphere and decor is really cute but sad to say, that is not enough to bring me back. The Tuna Ceviche was probably the most exciting thing there. The tanginess and these crunch lil things which I suspect is fried roe makes the dish! The tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. We thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. This sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. Totally disappointing and I will not be back!.Don't like this place at all. 

We made the mistake to go there at a holiday weekend. 

It is super small and gets pretty packed and the worst is they still let people in when there is no space to stand or dance anywhere. I know that the security there is doing their job, but when you get in you follow a hallway and if people in front of you are blocking the way and you get pushed out of the way by security then you regret having paid 50$ for guys and 20$ as a girl.If you like to be treated like a herd of cattle and feel like a sardine then by all means go but the rude as heck bouncers who are a bunch of mindless dip sh*ts  and the over prices with little chance if actually get a drink I think this place is garbageHaving traveled around the world from LA to NYC to Greece always stopping for some great sushi along the way I thought I'd try Blue Ribbon...let's say it just doesn't make the mark. I don't mind dropping a few bills on a well enjoyed dinner but not one that comes with a taste of salt and bad fish with every bite.I was with a group of 4, we ordered four types of sashimi, rock shrimp that came out in tiny balls of fried saltiness- red lobster would have done better, they lacked the shrimp inside, the whole grilled sea bass which was again salty and way overpriced at $48, it was barely enough for one person. Not being satisfied and still starving and parched we thought we'd try to order some hand and cut rolls...what a mistake we literally sent them all back. The only decent item we had was the saki and the service wasn't too bad when he remembered to bring our orders. I would never go back here or recommend this to anyone, I would say try Nobu or the sushi restaurant at the Wynn in Vegas because the $400 bill and bad taste in your mouth won't sit well in your mind after dining here. They have alot of work to do here.
  We actually ate again 2 hours later at La cave in the Wynn for some well enjoyed late night bites by Chef Billy. Thank god for some real food and truffle grits to recover from the earlier disappointment.I LOVE Cafe Rio to pieces but tonight they ran completely out of napkins and no horchata or any of their lemonades. The line to pay took forever. Our food was ready long before we could pay. Just a bad night I suppose. They know it's dinner time so they need to pick up their slack.The Forum Shops are nice... this rating is actually for Essentials at The Forum. DO NOT SHOP THERE!!! If you do, DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD. My card number was stolen and I have a pretty good feeling that it was from the clerk at this shop. My friend and I went in on August 12th to purchase some aspirin and a bottle of water. My friend purchased her stuff before me using cash. I rang up after her. I handed the clerk my card, after he grabbed it, he stared at it for at least 20 seconds before swiping it through (he also stared at the back for a few seconds, probably to memorize the card number and the secure code). I was completely weirded out by it, and almost canceled my card right after I left, but decided not to (the thought of being in Vegas without being able to possibly use it made me decide not to). I wish I would have!! Yesterday someone using my card number charged over $2000 in a matter of 30 minutes online shopping for auto parts and jewelry. I do not use that card very often, so I have a very good feeling that this was the case.

Do not give this place your business, and if you do, USE CASH. I am not one to write bad reviews, but you can tell how discouraging this could be.

Also, I did not see a yelp for this particular business on here, so I decided to write my review here instead.I wouldn't choose any stars if I had the opportunity to. I recently bought a gift card from this location for $120. When I first called this location, they said there is nothing they can do about it. When I called another location, they said that Massage Envy has the information on file, and can easily pull it up. I called the Rainbow location back and they refused to do it. They are trying to keep my $120 for no apparent reason. Why should they be entitled to my money? They have the giftcard number under my account, so why can't I use it???? No one else can, so what's the difference? I even talked to the manager who #1 wouldn't let me finish my thoughts, and #2 was very rude and hung up on me when I asked for her name. 

DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION. GO TO ANOTHER ONE THAT WON'T STEAL YOUR MONEY.Stopped in to look at new Galaxy 5.  First thing that put me off was the music in the store was so loud you could not hear what was being said and was told no they could not turn the volume down.  Finally went to back of store and sales person showed us the phone.  When we discussed price he said we could probably get a better deal somewhere else.  REALLY????  We decided that would be our last visit to this store.Worst customer service EVER!  We called last Thursday to order 6 tickets for  Sundays game. The call went fine, however when we went into our email to print the tickets on Saturday night, we realized the ticket office had given us tickets for the WRONG DAY! We tried to call the ticket office, but they were closed over the weekend.  So we didn't get to go to the game on Sunday. When we called on Monday to get this resolved, we were told that all we could do was exchange the tickets for a future date. EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE ERROR OF THE BALLPARKS EMPLOYEE, THEY WON'T GIVE US A REFUND!!  What's more, they told us we had to exchange the tickets by TODAY!  I have spent my morning at work trying to contact my friends who complete the set of 6 tickets, so that we can get a new date arranged.  This has been an awful experience and really shows that Salt River Fields doesn't care about their locals They are already creating a bad image for the new park.I wouldn't even give this place one star! We researched on the Internet and decided to check it out. We drove an hour and when we reach the place it's freakn CLOSED! There was nothing on the Internet about that. Sign said closed for reorganization. So we called to see when they would be open thinking that hopefully the would be open before I leave Phoenix in a week. But guess what? The freakn phone number had been disconnected! Go figure! Even if they were to call and say we're open tomorrow I wouldn't go back.This venue is terrible! Security would continuously force out people that were trying to get in line early. At one point a few ladies were hiding out in a near by restroom in order to keep from being thrown out until security caught on and made them leave. When tickets are general admission, those that show up early often do so in order to be as close as possible to the stage, but the staff here highly opposes that practice. People holding Vip tickets ended up going first. There were a few audio glitches and I paid $5 for a CUP of water. I really wish bands would stop doing shows here.*  Hostesses are children trying to act like adults
*  Service is slow (painfully slow)
*  Employees all have an attitude and not a good one
*  Mediocre food
*  Watered down drinks
*  Expensive drinks
*  Overall dirty and sticky
*  Restrooms on one corner of the structure which is about 100 yards from some tables.
*  Need I say more?Terrible experience.

Went for a late lunch around 3pm today. Checking in at the hostess stand was normal but it wasn't a good vibe. All the employees seemed very stressed out.

We were told it was a 5 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes.

We were seated directly next to a giant table of children. As a well dressed modern couple with no children in tow of our own, most restaurants have the decent sense to seat us away from misbehaving hellions using their silverware as drumsticks.. Ok well the restaurant was on a wait you say... deal with it its a table.. But the restaurant was far from full, the wait was due to being understaffed. I would estimate 20-30% of the tables in view were open.

Water glasses were brought to the table as soon as we sat down. They were still steaming hot as well as wet on the inside and out... awesome :rolls eyes:

So we pick up a menu that weighs over a pound and see that they have some really yummy sounding stuff, from drinks to dessert we found multiple items we wanted to try. We picked out martinis, and decided on splitting an app, soup, and crepe so we could save room to sample desserts. We even picked out stuff to try for next time. We can walk here in 5 minutes from where we live, this menu had so much stuff we wanted to try, as well as being 24hrs a day, we were really hoping this could be a go to spot for us.

I checked my watch when we sat down. After closing our menus I checked it again, and it had been almost 10 minutes and the only person who had be to our table was the busser delivering the empty glasses.

We sat with closed menus and heads scanning for someone to notice us for another 5 minutes. After 15 minutes in total had gone by, we decided to leave.

We both decided to give it another try down the road, the menu looks great. But for now I cannot recommend this restaurant anyone. The service here is terrible.Expensive and the food sucks? Not the business my friends. The ambiance is nice and fun, but the food didn't deliver. It was bland and nothing I expected, plus I'm paying an arm and leg for it. No thanks, but get one of those giant cocktails - they're pretty neat.Found this place due to Groupon.  Got brazilian area treated, and was seeing success, but my laser tech who is super friendly does the treatment so fast, she skips over huge areas, and that is very obvious at the end of my package.  Areas of hair loss are super patchy, and if my tech had been consistent with laser pulses, the treatment would have been a success.  If you are thinking about using them, I can't help but think that they give discount treatment to discount customers- especially in large areas where you can't see the treatment.  I have one treatment left, and I'm going to say something to her about it.  I had canceled an appointment over the phone (they require 24 hours notice) and they claimed they never got my message, and took away one of my pre-paid appointments.We were visiting from out of town and like to "eat local". There were only 4 other tables when we arrived and 5 or 6 staff standing around we waited 15-20 minutes after being seated before anyone came by. I was brought the wrong beverage the large Cesar salad came with 1 garlic knot for two of us and the pizza was just ok. I would not normally leave a yelp but the service was really shameful we won't be back this trip or any other.Poor service is the status quo at this place.  I came in and sat myself after standing in the door way for a couple of minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself because no one was their nor was their any signage  to direct people.

I sat at the table and waited for 10 mins and one had even said hello or made any eye contact.  There was a person at the table next to me that was having the same issue.I can't even comment on the food they serve here. Reason being, there was no food to be served. Arrived at the restaurant, never was greeted but only to sit down next to the bar. No problem with that, except no one even tried to acknowledge us. Sat unwaited for about 15 mins, being clearly visible to the wait staff. Left disappointed and clearly upset with the unprofessionalism and discern of the staff at mellow mushroom. I should give them 0 stars but you can't. Never tasted the food and staff was rude. Disappointed customer!!The food was good, but seriously.....$21.95 for a 6 oz chicken dish. No kids menu. Three servers for a thirty person party and a half full dining room. The original tutti's was much betterI really want to give a better review because the Staff seemed nice enough.  However, there were too many elements that turned me off.  This is a seemingly middle of the road restaurant, however, they act like a fast food restaurant: no glasses, napkins, or silverware...and my Bento Box was served in Styrofoam (even though I was asked, "For here or to go?").

The salad that was served with the Bento Box was less than sub par; all I saw was old iceberg lettuce.  To their credit, the piece of salmon that was served was of very good size.  The taste was nothing special, but it was not bad either.

They made the mistake of giving us a "free sample" of the California Roll.    It scared us.  If this was what we would experience when the sushi arrived, it was AWFUL because it was so obviously OLD!

The sushi was much better than our "sample" when it arrived, thank goodness.

All in all, this is a poor value for the quality of the food.  Sorry Yoshi.I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.

Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.Buying an exhaust system is really hard, mostly because you don't know how its going to sound.  So you rely on the people that work there to provide the best possible solution for what you want.   I explained exactly what I DIDN'T want my car to sound like and the goal of what I was looking for.   However, the result, is exactly what I explained to them I didn't want.

Now, the actual work seems to be good (welds, etc), but the outcome is terrible for spending $600+ on a custom exhaust system.  When I called back to express my disinterest in the work performed, they basically said there was not much they could do.  I'm assuming that means that I'll basically have to pay again to rework my exhaust.

Now I have a car that I love, but hate to drive.  It seriously makes me cringe every time step on the gas.  Also, after I turn my car off now and leave it in the garage, I have a really bad carbon monoxide smell in my garage and have to leave my garage door cracked until the smell goes away.  I may try to buy some resonators or something and see if that can help, but I won't be bringing them here to get put on.   

The only positives I can say is that they did the work pretty quickly as I went and didn't have to wait very long.  The guys were also very nice, but just didn't seem to know what I wanted or how to do it.This place has its ups and downs.  We went the first weekend they opened and, while the pizza was good, the wine selection was not.  And we were there for three hours - not what you expect for a pizza dinner.  Granted the place was packed.  I've been back a few other times - once for dinner and twice for lunch.  The last time I went was the Saturday of a holiday weekend.  The restaurant next door was pretty busy, but Brugo's was empty.  We were the only two people there at Noon.  Our server was sick.  When I asked about it, she said she had been sick for two weeks but had worked nearly every day.  (If you are a restaurant owner, please send sick people home!)  We also observed her go behind the bar and make herself a Bailey's and Chocolate Syrup drink.  The restaurant floor was not clean - crumbs under most of the tables.  The furniture looked like something someone picked up before it was sent to the trash - ripped seats, worn edges, upholstery pulling off of some chairs, etc.  Our check was $30 for two personal pizzas with three toppings each.  WAY too much for what they give you.

As we were leaving, I looked everywhere for a sanitation grade but could not find it.  Isn't it a requirement to display that?  Sadly, I won't be back.  I moved here from a much better culinary city - I live close by and miss good pizza.  Maybe they'll turn it around, but I'm not holding my breath.Not sure why I decided to go back after the first visit. Please dont support a restaurant that upcharges you $2 to substitute rice instead of fries. Cmon now.  Ridiculous. Also go check out Kyhber halal up the street insetad,Terrible service from the beginning since we could not sub tofu for meat on the lunch menu, lame! Then after taking the food home our daughter found a long hair in her soup right after she opened it...disaster!Never again.It is simply the worst restaurant  i have ever been to in my entire life. (I'm 39).

I don't even know where to start.

Even though it was completely empty; we waited several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there. 

We sat down. 

The place is filthy. Dusty. Grimy. Greasy. Terrible. 

Should have just left. But I really wanted to see what the food was like. The rice was burnt and I not sure that was actual chicken in the dishes.First and foremost, where's the dance floor? 

Service was pretty fast with getting me drinks but the quality of the drinks was terrible. Vodka cranberry tasted like something with cranberry syrup and the bartender gave me an attitude about how it's not his fault so it must be mine.

Packed with zombies in dress-code uniform and a long line. Revolver would have been a much better idea and it doesn't have a cover.Hands down the worst dining expereance of my life! Went in for my birthday dinner with a group of 9. The service was horrendous. He couldnt answer any of our questions and when i asked what came on dinner sushi orders he grabbed me a to go menu. The waiter didn't take two peoples orders forgot to put another one in and brought out the wrong meals. First bite of my sushi had a bone in it. The salmon and tuna was like beef jerkey. I have never sent a dish back in my life until last night. Nothing i ordered was esible. The bathrooms had water and toilet paper everywhere. Not one person in our party was satisfied. We ended up leaving and eating after. I was extremely disappointed.Who wants to get food poisoning during your vegas vaycay place is bomb  just do not get the alpastor meat made me sick all night!Planned to go there last Sunday because of all the great things we had heard about this place!  WELL, to our surprise, they were not open!!!  the huge NOW OPEN sign was hanging in the window, the hours on the door said they were open -- there were a few people inside, looked like they were cleaning the kitchen area or something........ but alas, all the doors were locked and the people inside completely ignored us!!  At least take down the huge NOW OPEN banner in the window!!!  Or post a sign on the door explaining why you would be locked up during your business hours!!!Beware of these shady rip off artist storm chasers!  

A guy from Jasper came knocking on my door and tried to sell me on how they would essentially rip off my insurance company by claiming my roof has wind damage.  My roof is fine.  There are no leaks and I check it myself inside and out regularly.  

He claimed it would only cost the insurance deductible.  And I would get an additional benefit if I had their ugly sign in my front yard that let my whole neighborhood know "I committed insurance fraud! "

I would never "buy" a new roof from someone who knocks on my door and gives a drive-by assessment.My sister an I visited recently. We couldn't win anything on slots, they were sp tight. After losing a good amount of money, we decided to give bingo a try.  What a ripoff.  We each spent over $50 for our buy in, and never came close. This place seats like 100 people. Never again! I will stick to playing at the Fort where I can win when the place is at capacity,  and spend less than $50.Poor service, tables and seats dirty.nice design...they forgot the quality food....I agree with another reviewer that this Toy shop is more like a "labor of love" - like a personal collection in a store? Everything was over priced and much smaller than I thought - 
I really wanted to visit this store after watching Johnny on Pawn Stars, and being a huge toy fan. So I dragged my family through downtown, fought the heat and finally found this small hidden store- 
At first sight I was excited for my 12 year old girl to see all the old school toys I once played with, it was a Sunday so I didn't see Johnny there- no big deal, but no one even talked to me or acknowledged us-
BUT, what really tweaked me was there was a TV on with a DVD of a comedian that was cussing, dropping F bombs and talking about masturbating with the volume really loud???? So I quickly whisked my little girl away and walked to the other side of the store- I didn't get to say anything to the only employee there who was clueless and talking away with his buddy! 
So I gathered my family and left!! 
Johnny I'm super disappointed in the fact that a TOY STORE should NOT have a DVD playing like that!!!  I don't care if it's Vegas, it's inappropriate!!! 
PARENTS- be aware, apparently this store is for 30+ year old nerds - not children

Sorry Johnny, I'm sure your a great guy- just letting you know how we felt about our first and last time at your store -If I could give them 0 stars I would. Weekly plus had an offer for their brownies so I called Slade Grove (they answered the phone....hello.....nothing more....that should have been my first clue to their unprofessional ways) to ask them if their brownies were of a decent size to give out to my guests on Christmas.  I mentioned that I was looking to buy the Weekly Plus deal.  The man said oh yes, they are very large and that would work, so I bought the deal. The next day I went to order the brownies and was told by voice recording only that I couldn't order them for Christmas.  That was the sole purpose for my purchase and the reason I called and spoke with Slade Grove first.  I tried several times to reach them by phone but only ever got a recording.  I also left several messages which to this day have not been responded to.  There is no brownie in the world that is worth this terrible service.  Beware of this company.So Friday night and my car needs a bath. My normal spot is closed already so I went to Ecowash to give it a try. On their website they show all these people hand washing your car and since I have an expensive new convertible this is exactly what I'm looking for.

  Unfortunately that is not what I get. They sent it through their tunnel and had someone go around it with a spray washer like you see in the self serve car washes. Needless to say when they pulled it around it was still covered in all kinds of dirt because they never used any kind of brush on it. I spent $35 on a wash that would have cost me $3 in quarters. They did a good job on the vacuuming and leather ($10 extra) but the windows looked like crap with lots of lent and missed spots.

  When I mentioned to the manager how what I expected and what I received were two different things, I got a pat answer about how the brushes didn't touch my car. He didn't seem to care at all that my car didn't get cleaned well and never offered any discount or apologies. He did, however, go outside and yell at the guy who took my car in like it was his fault.. great management style-   :rolling eyes:

  I still tipped $5 but just because I always tip, they really didn't deserve it. After spending $50 I'm about to go outside and finish the job myself. 

  Steer clear (pun intended), there are much better places to give your car a bath.First off walking in the establishment, I see a green B and two red C's posted in the front counter (during the time of my visit). So that kind of makes me wonder. But anyways, the service isn't that great at all. I know dim sum restaurants typically don't have great service but this place blows them all out of the park. The food was bland and they offered to heat the noodle dish they served to us. They came back with it and it was still COLD. The fried squid was very mushy and tasted a little bitter. Dumplings were probably the best thing to eat there. Oh and you have to ask like 5 people to bring you rice. I wouldn't want to come back here.Worst burger I have ever eaten. Went here on a groupon and would never go back. The burger on the overall just tasted bad/funny. I think it was the sauce and lettuce. I deconstructed the burger and still only ate half of it. The meat really had no taste. Sucks to say but on my burger journey this place was rock bottom. 

The only redeeming quality for this place was the maple bacon shake. Now this was tasty. Don't see myself going out of the way for it. 

Definitely a skip over this place for me.Having visited The Barrymore twice previously for lunch, I was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner. Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time. 

Our group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight. 

I ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked. 

I liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.


Update: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing.Miserable experience on 10/17/2013.  I specifically asked that a certain sandwich not contain any garnish:  nothing.  I just wanted the turkey, bacon, bread and you're done.  Prior to finalizing the transaction, the guy that took my order would say something like, "so no mayo?"  and I'd be like NOTHING other than what's listed on the board minus the dressing.  I don't want anything.  Then the sandwich preparer person, a female, barks that the sandwich also comes with onions.  And I'm like uh, I don't want ANYTHING on the sandwich.  I got home and it was loaded with tomatoes and onions.  I started picking them off but the sandwich stunk of onions so I said screw it, I want my damn money back.  So I drove back and asked for the manager and I told him how I thought this experience was a sick joke since I specifically told his subordinates that I wanted basically a plain sandwich and that I just wanted my money back.  He said that they could fix it and I said no.  That I would not allow them to fix it and that I just wanted my money back.  So this white older gentleman who was listening in to all of this whom presumably owned the place as he was coming and going as he pleased into the back of the restaurant comes out and hands me a $10 and says "here, happy now?" and I'm like "I don't want your money.  I am not owed a ten.  Your staff made an error and I just want my refund back."  He proceeds to tell me that when I was there earlier that he listened to me making my request that I wanted the sandwich to be plain and that he hoped that his staff got it right.  So I tell him that then he should be a little bit more sympathetic for my frustration as I had to come back from my home, almost getting rear-ended in the process and now I'm having to deal with this.  He seemed  more agitated with me than with the fact that his staff couldn't get a simple order right.  When he came over to give me his personal $10 bill, he walked over to where I was and was right in front of my chest in a confrontational manner.  What a great example you set for your staff sir.  Way to salvage a customer from this bad experience.  I will never return nor will I ever recommend this place to any one else because of this incident.  Besides, I never really cared for their food and only frequented it because of its convenience.  Jersey Mike's kick their booty anyway but they are too far away.Worst bar in Tempe. They don't even know how to make a Long Island Iced Tea. Enough said.Disappointed. 

I came here on a Saturday night for dinner. There was a live band that took nearly our entire meal to set up. They were testing their equipment and the sound the entire time we were there. While they were setting up, the restaurant was trying to hide how loud the band was by blaring loud music overhead. I do like loud music, just not blaring like we're at Axis/Radius while I'm eating. 

The service was ok. The drinks took longer than our appetizers. They didn't even have enough shrimp to fill our one order of coconut shrimp. I had to get up and get my own salt and pepper from the bar after not seeing my server for nearly 15 mins after our entrees arrived. 

The food was AWFUL! I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend some handmade pasta Alfredo dish. Mine was just salmon and couscous. Nothing special and bland. The dish wasn't seasoned. My boyfriend had the same problem with his food, bland. Right after we left I felt sick after eating the little bit of food I did consume. 

To top off our "super great" experience we were overcharged for our wine on the bill. At this point we were far too annoyed to say anything and just paid the overage and left. I think its safe to say we wont be coming  back. Such a shame too, considering we've been looking for a great new place. Stay clear of this overpriced gross food. You would be much happier with basically any other restaurant in Old Town.From the frozen hash brown patty to the overcooked low quality ingredients in the breakfast burrito and the almost absent service this place is the lowest of the low vegas has to offer. a shame for this location.Disappointing overcooked tofu cubes.  Food did not appear or taste fresh.  Will not return.I would give this place zero stars if I could...I purchased a package of Zerona treatments (guaranteed to take inches off your waistline...not). I went in with the intention of purchasing a treatment for my stomach and got talked into buying an additional treatment for my arms. I was hesitant to do so because I had a suspicion that this treatment would be totally bogus. However the sales girl Jade, promised that it would if I followed the intensive list of directions you must follow while getting treated (including not drinking coffee, alcohol, exercising for a half hour every day, taking a $60 dollar supplement, drinking half of your weight in water, etc.). Well folks, I followed every single direction and guess what? I LOST EXACTLY ZERO INCHES. 

I wasn't upset at the outcome as I figured anything that promises extreme inch loss is more likely than not to be bogus. However, I did become upset when after my failed stomach treatment I asked to be refunded for my arm treatment and they refused! They told me that the two treatments were purchased as a package and because I was given "special pricing" I could not get my money back for a treatment I know doesn't work. Special pricing my a$$, one of their sales techniques is to pretend like you're getting a great deal, but it took one or two times back in to realize that EVERYONE GETS "SPECIAL" pricing. Also, the contract you sign is very misleading, I read that you could be refunded for unused treatments, but really they will give you credit towards some other stupid treatment I don't want. As far as the staff, they're really super nice on your consultation visit...but that ends the minute you sign your money away. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY HERE! It would be better spent being set on fire, at least that way your time will not be wasted too.Online Order would not work...
Called in Order...
New Employee, gave order 3X
Arrived Wrong!!!! Pizza under done, No side of marianara as ordered.

Why bother Order from a cpizza hain if they cant do anything right?
Ruined the whole reason for ordering a pie
For 30 bucks I can grill steaks

That is what I will do in the future
Papa Johns SUCKS!!!!!!!!Let's start out with the $66 admin fee for a 3 month sign-up. Cost me $206 out the door....

Take that, coupled with someone who has no clue on what he is doing, and you have a semblance of a gym.

Take my $210 and invest in either marketing or value-added benefits.

You guys need help...Went for lunch buffet during the week, the restaurant was quite empty and remained empty thru lunch hour. Food was okay, the rassum was excellent but rest of the food was pretty much just okay. The buffet menu is v sparse, perhaps the weekend buffet has a better selection. $8.99 seemed a bit steep considering the selection and the taste.Please don't waste your time nor money. I did. The manager seems nice but screws you over. I left work for a 2 hour job and it's been over 4 hours now. And this is my second trip due to the techs not doing their job.Ok, so I agree his place needs to decide what they want to be.  I like the decor changes, and was actually excited about the German menu, and really liked many of these Options.  Alas, last time we went in, menu back to standard Cave Creek bar/Mexican/generic fried offerings.  Oh we'll, decided to give it a try anyway.   Took some time to get initial service despite being quite empty.  Ordered some drinks and apps.  Apps came out before we got our drinks, OK, then the waitress drops a wineglass on the table completely shattering it.  Still Ok, these things happen.

Then the wheels came off.  We moved to a new table, as ours was completely covered in glass, and the server tried to move all our drinks that were on the table at the time of the incident to our new table.  We were like, those may have glass in them too, could you bring us new ones?  She says sure, then another server comes over and tries to give us our glass shard containing apps back.

That was it.  I'll wait for new management before going back.  If this is going on right in front of the customers, I shudder to think of what may be going on in the back.This place looks like a cool bar/restaurant but it was terrible.  We waited 30 min for a burger and then the server charged a $5 split plate fee because my husband and I split!  He didn't even make us aware of the charge until we got our bill and then told us that it was noted on the menu so he couldn't reverse it.  We called the manager after we left and he said he would credit our check.  Well he never did it!
The burger was overcooked and the fries were cold.  I would NEVER visit this place again!Worst wait ever. Longer wait than a doctor's office just to return some equipment.  This store needs to hire more people.Same experience as everyone else; why are these clowns still in business?!?!

The service guy came out and, with a cheery smile, told me that the switch I needed him to fix had never worked in the first place. 1st time-  "Just so you know, it never worked that way." 2nd time- "Hmmm...just so you know, it never worked like that." 3rd time- "No, it never worked like that." Every time he argued (as he's staring in confusion at the light switch) I told him, "I've lived here ten years and the switch worked until I changed it."

SOOOOOOOO insulting! And in the end he couldn't fix it because he wouldn't even consider that I was right. He was opening outlets that have never been touched and trying to figure out some random outlet that the switch MUST go to. Refused to use a wire tracker and blew my brakers trying to attach the switch to an outlet it didn't belong on.

The "dispatcher" refuses to give prices over the phone because if they told you that they were going to charge you FIVE TIMES the normal rate, you'd hang up on them.

$156 to change an outlet?! $350 to "diagnose" a problem? $39 just to show up?

Plus this guy was a scam artist on top of being incompetent. I had a coupon for $49 off of service and the guy said he'd let me keep my coupon and just wave the $39 service charge. Ummm....that's a deal? They don't require you to know math to be an electrician?

Others have said that they wave the service fee if you hire them to perform a job anyway, something the dispatcher didn't tell me. Total extortion! You have to pay just to find out that they're going to over-charge you and that you don't want to hire them?!?!

Incompetent. Rude. Over-priced.

Don't be scared of your local electrician that charges by the hour. He's probably more familiar with the unique problems associated with buildings in your area than some random contractor from across the valley.Gwen put a few feathers in my hair that stayed in for about 3 weeks. She also used a white bead, and I have dark brown hair. WTF? Am I supposed to tell you how to do your job? When I tried to make another appt with her she was too busy, couldn't be bothered.Stupid crapWas extremely disappointed. I understand they just opened but it was a pretty bad experience. First off the workers on the line (food is served cafeteria style) didn't understand English. Items listed oh the menu were no longer available. ALL of the food was cold. Bartender sent two wrong drinks to start. Wait staff was too busy talking amongst each other to address their customers. Last of all, the price, it's way too expensive for the type of food offered and the quality. Maybe this place will make some changes in the future but for now I'd steer clear. Manager did the right thing by offering 50% off the bill and even she said that some changes need to be made.Am not sure who those 8) reviews were but this is the most horrible nail experience I've ever had.....I've asked for a mani-pedi.... Started w pedicure but technician rushed off to another client without finishing w me. I got passed on to another technician for manicure but I waited so long I lost interest.Yesterday i happened by Caketini at Fashion Square near Nordstom's.  I was doing research for "wedding" cupcakes.  I tried the "Tuxedo" cupcake to take home.  The person behind the counter said the frosting was their "signature" buttercream- so I assumed it would be good.  When I got home I tried a small edge of the frosting. It tasted like Crisco! Not Butter. I love to cook and know what butter tastes like. This frosting is not butter.-I spit it out.  Not good.  The cake itself was ok.Tourist trap, for the really really dumb tourists. My friend works here and offered us free tickets to go ice skating. We excitedly go down there with my 3.5 year old ice skating prodigy of a daughter and 7 year old son. We redeem our tickets and are told we can't go in until the next session... And that they won't allow under 7 on the ice... 

We get out there half an hour later, for our half hour skating session, and realize they can't allow anyone under 7 because they will die. This isn't ice. It's plastic. It's slippery it's absolutely no traction. You can barely move without slipping. The skates are terrible fits with them being so big and bulky at the top. Half an hour later, they kick you out after the tourist schmucks paid $15/person. 

Here's my tip. Somewhere else very nearby on the strip, is a big casino also with outdoor ice skating. Except, it has real ice, no time limits, and you can even go up there to watch without paying!! Take that 30 minute walk and get your money's worth and don't bother with the plexiglass.I had a root canal done on June 14th and 3 weeks later went back for my permanent where i complained of pain to eating cold and hot. His assistant took x rays and told me it was cement in my teeth when he was removing and cleaning up my temporary crown. Dr Moeller came in didnt say a word about my x ray and put my crown on. then i go again August 8th to have them find out why im in more pain and called ahead and said i dont want to be billed and im not paying anymore money until u tell me whats wrong. so i go. and they bill my insurance. and he tells me some patients dont take to a root canal and might need surgery. So far from the truth. so September 4th comes and im in excruciating pain constantly now. I go to an endodontist of my choice and find out that my root canal was not done properly. it needed to be redone and because my insurance is now tapped out due to Dr Moeller i now have paid $1000.00 out of my pocket and find out he billed me for a filling i already had. So now my insurance has paid $1400.00 and ive paid $375.00 to him and now $1000.00 out of pocket for retreatment. I went to get my crown filled and find out its also not done properly so now I need to pay $1400.00 out of pocket for that. Im at $2800.00 out of pocket and my insurance is at $1400.00. This place is a joke and so is he. Very unprofessional when it comes to taking responsibility for mistakes. I couldnt eat for days or sleep. i was on pain pill and anitibiotics and lost wages from having to miss work to run around a deal with this. With no help from Comfort Dental. Please do not go here. His lack of concern has now cost me money and pain and put my family out.1 star for the awesome view this spot has to offer..  

My experience here was a whole other story.  We went into Hyde to scope out the spot.  While deciding what to do next, a handful of patrons started hurling racial slurs at us.  NOT COOL.  Management did absolutely nothing.  I would never step foot at Hyde ever again.Went there first time on Sat night 1-27-13, Don't get the floor plan layout of this club. You walk in and wayyyyy in the back is one bar with over priced drinks!!!! This club is not even on the strip and they charge wayyy to much for drinks, unacceptable. The dance floor is round and people always walking by you to get to the bar way in the back!!! The sound system is one of the worst in Las Vegas gay clubs, there really no bass. Most of their VIP tables are right in the middle of the dance area, very annoying if you're paying for bottle service and people knocking into you... The lighting is bad too.. I would say Piranha night club is much better for music, drinks, and location, much closer to the strip hotels...Promoters just tell you what you want to hear so they can make their money.  We were told we were going to get out at the front of the line and get in free with drink comps.  We ended up waiting in 2 different lines and left before they sent us to the 3rd line.  They basically just fill you up with false hope.Smelled REALLY good, looked REALLY good but wasn't able to get any!  :(

Went today, Saturday, at 2:00 and waited in line for 15 mins without moving.  People were coming in behind me and leaving because it was taking WAY too long. Other people who had ordered and were waiting for their food were also upset because they were having to wait too long. Couldn't even take a menu because they were out. 

Will give it a second chance, maybe during the week or see if they accept carry out calls.It's a shame.  I really wanted to like this place. ...as I live close by.  I went there at 6pm on a Friday.  There was only 2 other tables sat in the place.  FYI, this place is basically just like the inside of any gas station, but it has some tables in one corner that they call a restaurant.  They have a sign that says "please wait to be seated",  I stood next to this sign for 10 minutes before some one walked by, and I had to stop them and ask "How do I get seated?" To which he replied, oh, I didn't see you.   I was with my wife and son,btw.  We get seated, and my 23 month old son is cranky, so I order a cup for him that I can put his milk in, and me and my wife order a water and a coke,  the waitress comes back with just my coke.  I ask again for the cup for my son, she then brings it.  i order fries just to have something quick to keep my son happy while we wait for our food and me and my wife get the caprese flat bread.  By the time someone else brings the food out, it is cold.  My son starts into the fries right away (which weren't bad despite being cold)  My wife and I try to eat the cold caprese flat bread and it was so bland, there was no balsamic vinaigrette that you normally get with a dish like this.  We have to grab her attention again to order our food, and order a side of balsamic vinaigrette.  After 20 minutes, with a cold uneaten caprese and fries almost depleted, i go up to the counter and request the vinaigrette again - she finally gives it to me, and we dump it on our cold soggy flat bread, which makes it about 1% better.  Another 30 minutes pass, My son has now finished the entire plate of fries, too full to eat any real food.  i go up to tell our waitress that we are going to need our food to go.  She says ok.  Minutes later, she walks up with our food on dishes, and sets a couple boxes down with it.  basically saying, i know the food was bad and late and you're had shitty service, but here, you can box it too.  This was the icing on the cake.  Bad food, horrendous service, bad atmosphere.  Did I mention over-priced?  $14.00 for a sandwich and the smell of the car wash coming through, no thanks.If I could give no stars for this place I would. A childs first visit to the dentist should be a somewhat comforting pleasant one. The only thing my 3yr old grandson remembers is the dentist putting his hand over my grandsons mouth to cover his crying. When a child is scared to death and crying you dont cover his mouth. This place just gave me a bad vibe. He definitely will not be back and will not be recommending this place.I stopped by this place so I could give a small local owned business a chance to earn my business and at 11:30 AM on Friday morning they were not serving sandwiches because their manager wasn't there. ??  I went across the street to Wendy's and they were happy to fix me lunch and take my cash. 

The location is terrible and I actually had to make an effort to find them in the strip mall that they are located in. You would think that they could at least be ready to serve lunch at lunchtime.The meatloaf sucks!

We love their ham, sandwiches and sides, but  yesterday my wife bought a meatloaf and side of loaded mashed potatoes from Honeybaked Ham.  What a horrible meal.

The meatloaf is dense and has a thick layer of ketchup.  When I say dense, I mean it is about the size and density of a brick.  The taste was not actually bad (once you get past the ketchup), but texture is something I just could not adjust to.

The mashed potatoes -loaded style- had bacon, chunks of potato, and probably sour cream and cheese.  Not suited to my taste. 

I will buy from them again, just will stick to the ham!After some people had mentioned that they liked this place, my wife and I decided to go and test, yet again, another Peruvian restaurant.  We ordered 3 different meals, lomo a caballo, arroz con mariscos, and pollo a la brasa.  The lomo a caballo would have been pretty good, but the sauce they had was sweet, which I didn't like at all.  The arroz con mariscos was bland, hardly any flavor.  The pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal, being dry and unflavorful.  we did get a free soup with our meal, which was the best thing we tasted there.  The sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them, and were not refilled until I finally had to ask.  We also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa.  The aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.  Overall, it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food.  Sadly, we haven't been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that we like in AZ, and this one was probably the worst one we've tried.

Wow! It's a good thing you can edit these reviews.  A lot has happened since I made this review, which the last time I checked is an opinion of what I think.  The owner of this restaurant, upon reading my review, posted it on "Peruanos en Arizona," a group on Facebook.  He mentioned my full name in the review, opening it up to his "friends" to personally attack me.  He also said that that I went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant. (which I didn't).   My wife made some comments, defending our opinion, and then he scanned our yelp coupon (which has my full name on it,) and order sheet that was made when we paid, and posted it on the same page as a picture, claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration. (which is not shown in the picture.) He claims to be a professional, but is far from it.  I had nothing against him personally, until now, but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless I have something personal against him.  I don't think I need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who I personally don't like. He also posted the same review on his personal facebook page, to which his "friends" responded things like, "poor gringo, he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like" and "He doesn't have the smallest idea of what real Peruvian Food is, he probably hasn't even been there," "with a last name like that, what does he know," "He's one of 'those' customers", "I hope the seafood got him sick,"  words like jealous, ignorant... things like that.  Now if I didn't know any better, I would think that a gringo's opinion doesn't matter when it comes to real Peruvian food, too.  However, I HAVE been to Peru, I DO know what good Peruvian food is supposed to taste like, and my wife, who is actually FROM Peru was equally disappointed with the food, and service.  Her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy, and we both know that what we ate doesn't compare to what real Peruvian food is supposed to be.  So, instead of taking this as constructive criticism, the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him, and has to look for validation from other people who surround him.  We probably would have been back there again, because my wife's family would have wanted to try the "new Peruvian restaurant" which has happened before with others, but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there.  There are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant, not just Yelp.  I'll make sure to put this same review on other sites, too.  That will also give me time to think up other things that I didn't like that I didn't mention on my original review.  Like how this "professional" was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests.  When I made this review, Yelp posted it on my facebook page, but I took it down because it was negative, but I will be sure to post it now.  I don't know if what this guy did was legal, but I'll find out soon enough.  I just hope he doesn't put my Debit Card number up on facebook.  So, if you're going to give this place a negative review, watch out!  You'll be personally attacked for your OPINION, and be lied about and be told you don't know what you're talking about.  He has since taken down all his posts, but I saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested.Always like to check out new places, this place sucks and it's overpriced. Although the Reuben hamburger that my ex wife got was pretty good, everything else was just the same ol bland crap that you would get at any other average restaurant. I definitely won't be going back there, I'll be surprised if its still open after six months. I'll give the owner some credit, she greated us at the door and was very nice. I had the turkey burger with fried okra and didn't like any of it.Messy and not enough AC. Too crowed with sweaty smell. Will never go back.Burger was good, but the service is AWFUL!!!! We sat down on Memorial Day (Monday) and waited 1:00 for 3 burgers and a kids meal.  Really!!!!!????!!!!  The AC was blaring, the wait staff seemed embarrassed by the delay, and we were told we were going to get taken care of for our trouble (we really didn't complain a lot about the lousy service at the time).  Our waiter graciously (sarcastically) took of 10% of a whopping 25$ bill...Wow, if I made $2.50 an hour it might of been worth my wait, fortunately I don't.  Avoid until they get their stuff straightened out, the food actually was not bad.I felt robbed! Not only was the chicken super salty but I paid $15 for  a two piece over cooked plate with super salty mac n cheese and DRY chicken breasts, a 4 piece strip meal that the fires tasted the best. I had the greens as a second side on the 2 piece meal and it was ok, but tasted like it was from a can. I was soooo disappointed! After all that I realized I should have received a drink with my 2 piece meal. For the wait and the quality of food I was better off doing it myself or going to Church's. At least I know that I would have received my drink and really needed the handful of napkins for my fingers...Sorry Flav....but either it was the wrong time of day or some people dont have taste buds. My blood pressure was off the charts after your food and it was from more than the salt additve I ingested. Dont buy into the hype folks. I was really suprised after looking at some of the photos posted of their meals because my meal didnt look nothing like what was posted. Dry overcooked and salty I cant say it enough.Ridiculous! Sandwiches are lackluster, overpriced and taste like something purchased at a gas station.

I ordered the hot Roast Beef sandwich ($6.29)

What I received was a stale onion roll with what I have to call "roast beef" and wilted lettuce. No cheddar cheese, caramelized onions or avocado (which I paid extra for).

If you live in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and go to Subway or Jimmy Johns!

Simpo Sandwich is simply another example of an unskilled (and unqualified) businessman thinking they can get away with selling garbage. Unbelievable!

Written by SgroAll these locations are just true crooks let's file class-action lawsuit against them for being thieves!I really miss the OLD Cheers. I loved the old bartenders, regulars, and dive-y, chill atmosphere. 

Since they have reopened, I have given Cheers Tavern several opportunities to make me a regular. It seems that this place has no desire to keep the old clientele. It's disappointing that I have lost a place to hang out -- at least there's still Tony's. 

New Cheers is too pricey for a dive bar. I don't see why this place is ever busy because of the prices. Although, if this place was slightly enjoyable, I would gladly pay for their over-priced drinks.

They are competing with the other bars in Glendale, for the douchey-ist bar in the valley. Which is sad because there are so many bro-friendly bars on the westside. None of the old regulars come to this bar and, from what it seems, new Cheers doesn't even attempt to retain the old regulars. Also, the owners' responses to the once-regulars' reactions on the changes are crass and appalling. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. 

Although, one plus-side is their bathrooms are no longer disgusting -- hence, the one star. 

I miss Sunni, Missy, Jess, and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, everything about the OLD Cheers. Once again, they have lost another paying customer, who was once a loyal regular.I would not return to this restaurant. Not so much because of the food, which was ok, (not good or great.) but because of their lack of customer service and unfair price advertising.

Their menu does not correctly reflect their prices and they charged me for fries/salad on top of the price of the gyro. The menu states "served with fries or a salad" but when I got my bill I was charged additional money for the side items. When I questioned it, I was told that was a lunch special. The menu is on their wall and there is a menu handout and there is nothing about lunch specials or lunch pricing.

They would NOT take the charges off, but just kept arguing with me.Service is bad, bad, bad. Although the food is okay portion, the staff there brings this rating way down. 

I was there during a lunch rush, although it wasn't completely slammed, a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how SHE IS F****** WORKING!!!! Crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock. 

Aside from this little mishap,  you can't get seated, order you meal, get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all. I almost left exact change when I got my bill, but decided tip lite anyway. 

Food is full of grease, just about everything on their lunch menu is fried. What a disappointment. 

I won't be back and I hope for the sake of this place they will consider hiring staff with some customer service skills. 

Oh and WTF, FOX news is the only news network they show!NO stars if possible! I am reviewing only on the nightclub aspect. The sound system in this place is terrible, you couldn't even hear the music, only bass bass bass. Drinks extremely watered down and only 2 bartenders in the whole place! At least 2 fights broke out and the people that were fighting were not even taken out of the club. Avoid!This place is located inside of the Flamingo. I am a betting man and I bet in a year or less this place will close. The drinks and the food are terrible. I wish I had lost my money gambling. If Yelp offered a 1/4 star I would have checked it. Go to Margaritaville you will get fantastic potent drinks and great  food. Adios Carlos and Charlie's. Never ever again!We were wanting Mexican food and this place was located in the hotel where we were staying....ideal we thought.  It was absolutely terrible!!!  Service was bad and food and drinks totally over-priced.  I got a chicken chimi and the chicken was spoiled.  I took one bite and literally gagged.  My husband is a chef and smelled it and immediately knew it was rotten.  I lost my appetite so did not re-order.  Husbands tacos were tasteless. They did not charge us for my meal but our bill still totaled $50.  A total disaster!!Today Sunday March 30, 2014 just came from Firefly S.Eastern location in Las Vegas. Here and order from the breakfast menu.....what I found and got
Wet table, dirty chairs and floor you can actually see the food under the table.
Asked for a Café Latte, was asked if I wanted milk ??????Hellooo
Asked for a glass of water, could not drink out the glass Dirteyyyyyy
Order Bacon, got burned strips wll behond well done (I did not asked)
Paid the bill and after 45 minutes of done eating had to asked the server to please clean the table. The staff is very young with no experience nor training in the restaurant industry.   Never again.....Customer Service in this store is deplorable.  I have tried to consign several times and run into lack of an organized system and just plain rudeness from the employees. All I want to do is track the items that they accept and know what they sell for. This seems like it could go on some kind of on-line system. Instead, anytime you want to know if your items are available, sold, or donated, you have to ask for a print-out. The staff hates to give printouts and most of them don't know how to do this. I have asked for clarification--"What should I ask the clerk for--is it an inventory sheet? what is it called?" I just want to track my sold items and be able to easily pick up items about to expire.
Every time I go there they act like I am putting them out and they have no idea what an inventory sheet is.
REALLY?  I think I have a right to know what is happening with my items. Afterall, Turnstyle is making a nice profit on these. 
Isn't there an easier way for the consigner? This is a business.  Turnstyle is making lots of money on our stuff.
I would welcome a manager to email me or let me know how to contact her.  I read in the 2/20/14 post that there is a regional manager named Gail. 
Gail--pls contact me so that I can give some constructive feedback. I would like to come back and become a consigner again, but your staff Scares me!
Also, I think the timeline for how long you keep the items is too short. Two months (sometimes it is this short) is not enough selling time.
Also, is there a better way for us consigners to "find" our unsold items before the expiration? Otherwise, if you leave them there, you lose all rights to the items. Even if the item sells, if it goes past the expiration date you are not entitled to any of that money.   That sounds ridiculous.  I think 4 months would be a more reasonable time frame for all times of year.
In light of all this, I think that the small amount of money you MIGHT make on these purchases is not worth the hassle. I would rather give it to a charity that appreciates it than pad the wallets of Turnstyle executives.Beautiful bar and hotel ... but skip it for happy hour and watch out for deceptive wait staff.

Problem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.

The Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.

The Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. "But why?" you ask ...

Set the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.

Popcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.

Deviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.

Drinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a "summer shandy."

Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's "It's amazing"

What I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it. 

Was I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.

That's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.

So bottom line ... I think this place is worth a visit, but given my experience, I will not be returning on any regular basis.Was looking forward to authentic menudo ... it was disappointing - flavorless!  Really bland!  Not even the extra spices and salt helped.  It was like eating boiled tripe.  blech. And their super nachos?  They didn't use real cheese. Looked & tasted like velveeta!  We left and ate somewhere else. Wasted $$One thing i left out. House keeping WILL ENTER your room no matter what. Even if you have privacy do not enter they will. We left our Tv on Saturday and came back to it being shut off. We then noticed a piece of paper left that said house keeping comes in for a safety check. F U HOLIDAY INN!! Your people are corrupt and i am sure they are in cahoots with the thieves!You have to love tow-n-impound places. I'm not sure if my HOA started hating me but I've had to deal with this place twice now, about 14 days apart.

While they seem fairly nice, they aren't so nice to your wallet. Their hours are squarely at times when you are working, meanining that when you call them "after hours" they will charge you extra to bring someone "off-duty" to get your car out. What a racket.

When I was there the second time someone else had their car towed by Monster as well, only they said Monster just picked their car up in a legal parking spot and hauled it off and never told anyone. While I can't say whether the car was parked legally or not I can say that taking someone's car and telling nobody (mainly the police in this case) seems wrong. To me, that seems like vehicular ransom. The first time they towed at my place I called the police and the police had no record of it being towed. The police called back and said Monster had informed them they were in posession of the car. The second time I didn't call the police so I don't know if they ever informed the police (I already knew who took it so I called them first). I wouldn't doubt if they were into that type of thing honestly.

2-stars for being fairly nice. And 1-star if I could confirm that they were into car-ransom schemes.I REALLY wish there were reviews for 1NS from last year. Unfortunately (like the 10+ people who wrote reviews), I feel COMPLETELY ripped off, with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 

I would NEVER use 1NS group EVER AGAIN!!!!!! 

All the details that others provided are real and legit. The customer service is good ONLY up to the point that you buy them. It says that refunds are available if you contact them before EDC for bus shuttles only, but no one responds. 

If you're going to take a shuttle, highly recommend the OFFICIAL insomniac one. Yes, maybe the lines will be long too (but honestly, it's impossible to beat traffic unless you go early and leave early), but at least you know that it's reliable and will be running all night.

PS. I love that they don't post their NUMBERS for anything so that you can never contact them and emails are easy to delete...this place was a real dump  thus it closedI use dry cleaners quite frequently, spending roughly $80+ per month on dry cleaning.  My wife had been wanting to try the Tide dry cleaners so I let her take them there so we could get a feel for how good of a job they would do.  We took 5 dress shirts, 6 polo shirts and 3 pairs of slacks.  When taking the polo shirts out of the plastic, I noticed that they looked a little faded, but what struck me the most was the smell.  I can only describe it as a synthetic body odor.  It made me clinch when smelling it because it was so bad.  I took my dress shirts out of the plastic and found that they too had the same smell and they were not starched.  I pulled the slacks out of the plastic and they too smelled, but not as pungent as the polo shirts.  I couldn't wear these close because of the smell and the dress shirts wrinkled immediately without starch.  I decided to take the cloths back to the Tide dry cleaners and I spoke to the manager about my issues.  She told me that she couldn't smell anything bad about the shirts and that it was probably a fragrance added to the dry cleaning solution.  They added that horrific smell?  She told me that she would "try" to rewash them without the added fragrance.  No thanks.  She also told me that there was nothing that they could do about the starch because we needed to request it when we dropped them off.  That sounds like a cop out to me.  I would NEVER take any of my clothes back to this dry cleaner again!I had heard nothing but good things about this place so I was more than a little disappointed when we tried it. I had the pork dish which promised to be full of flavor. Far from it, it didn't even have salt. It was extremely bland & boring to say the least. The hubby had the beef tacos which tasted more like pot roast than Mexican food. Maybe the chef at the Phoenix location gets it right. This one surely doesn't. By far the worst food ever. I gave it 1 star because the waiter was great.The owner/manager of this so called Spa is awful, lacks basic customer service skills.  Cares only about the money, and if you dont become a member treats you like crap.  Even after meeting me MANY times, acts as if she has seen me for the first time when I come in.  Cancelled my membership, this is just another Massage Envy but WORSE.
Some of the front desk staff are very nice, too bad the manager is NOT.AKWARD. Really disappointed by the service. We were ignored, skipped, helped, ignored, skipped, and then the people before us were about to be rung up and we had to interupt them to remind them they were ignoring us again because we'd be sitting at cash for 5 minutes while they worked to help their friends. There was one guest ahead of us and one behind, and all of this took 1/2 hour. WHAT?? We weren't acknowledged when we entered the store but the people after us were- all three employees were catching up with them because they were obviously friends. It was REALLY bad. . . so embarrassing. The cookie sandwich was great but our guest experience was really a bummer.I'm giving this company a zero, because Scott the guy I spoke on the phone with was a complete zero. I set an appointment on Monday morning for Thursday at  8:30. I received a call at 4:00 on Wednesday afternoon and was informed they were changing my appoint to 11 am-12. My problem property is a rental and I couldn't arrange for later in the day.So Scott just canceled my appointment and told me to find another company. Did I say Scott was very condescending!!!I brought my car to Allen's because my headlights stopped working. They were very nice and got my car in quickly. They gave me a quote of $631 for a replacement headlight dimmer switch. After the initial sticker shock, I decide to research the part myself. I found the part online for $199 when Allen's was charging $460. When I called and questioned them about it, they said that is what NAPA quoted them. Sooooo, I called NAPA. The price they gave me was $350 (still $110 less than Allen's told me). I decided to order the part and change it myself. I feel like they were trying to get more money out of me unfairly. My quote from them has an "other charge" of $20 on top of the part from NAPA being marked up $110. I'm sad and disappointed that they tried to scam me out of money. I can't comment on the quality of their work as I decided not to go use their services. All I can comment on is that I feel as though they were dishonest in their part price quote. I will not be using or referring Allen's in the future.My favorite bar and grill in Surprise! Absolutely love the staff! Food is very good! Love the blackened chicken sliders! Oh and love places that give you peanuts and you throw the shells on the floor. Very nice patio!

Loved this place and was a regular here. Now they suddenly close and give no explanation. They removed themselves from Facebook where they could have posted a reason so regulars like us were not wondering why. Business always seemed good too. Thanks for nothin uncle bears!You know that little voice in your head that says not to go down that alley or drink that last drink? I was feeling that when booking for this show, but I thought, "Hey, it's Michael's music, I can do that." 

Boy, was I wrong.

Any time that you are seeing an impersonator, you have to remind yourself that they will never be as good as the original. Good, maybe even mediocre, and most of the times just god awful. This falls into the category of sheer fuckery, almost comical, and a bit sad. 

If you're playing Michael Jackson, you have to have the chops to not only sing, but dance as well. I felt that I was at a Happy Hour Karaoke, the dude's voice annoyed the heck out of me and he also forgot the lyrics most of the time! The mic went out at some times too. I found myself completely ignoring him and focusing my attention on the dancers and the musicians--that itself tells you it wasn't worth the price!!

As much as I was glad it was over, it was only an hour! Really?? I hated that the switching from song to song was so fast, it didn't give enough time to let the moment simmer, so to speak. It was like a game of how quickly I could get through the songs. SMH.

The audience seemed amused. Some people really go into it, so what do I know. The place is circular with seats, plus a bar that charges ridiculously for their drinks. Meh. 

Do yourself a favor, save your money and go see MJONE at Mandalay Bay.My car had trouble starting yesterday morning. I knew my battery must be going bad. I dropped my kids off to school and went to O'Reilly's to have them check my battery. (Since it should still be under warranty) For 8AM they were busy. I waited and finally an older man said he would test my battery. He asked me to start my car. It started up fine.  He tells me that there is nothing wrong with my battery. But will check it anyway.  I turn my car off and he hooks up his little device.  He tells me that my battery is 30% low and that I need to charge my battery. He said that my battery has a lot of life in it still.  He told me to come back this afternoon and he will charge it for me. He then told me that my alternator was bad and it wasn't the battery. He only checked to see if my battery was bad nothing was checked about the alternator. I leave and run some errands. I stopped to get gas and went to start my car up and it wouldn't turn over. AAA came out and with the same little device told me that my battery has a bad cell.  Printed off the report so I can prove to O'Reilly's that it is the battery. AAA jumped my car and off I went to another O'Reilly's they checked my battery and Alternator. He told me that my Alternator was good but I had a bad cell. I explained to him that I went to the 59th Ave store and they told me that nothing is wrong with the battery. Gary at the Lake Pleasant store told me that I should call the store and let them know that their machine might be broken since I did have a bad battery.

Called asked to speak to a manager. Spoke with Jess who I told him first off that I wasn't calling to complain but, I wanted them to be aware that their battery test machine might be broken. I also told him that the older man told me that my alternator was bad. I also check with my mechanic and he told me that I would know if it was my Alternator.  Told him the story and he proceeded to tell me that he was  a certified mechanic and me and my Mechanic didn't know what we were talking about. He got really defensive. I told him that I was just call to have them check their machine not to start anything. He then was completely rude. I told him that I will go to a different store instead of the 59th Ave. store.  He then hung up on me......

I had always bought my batteries and other car needs at their store. Not anymore.Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like Rusconi's. The chef/owner is makes an effort to greet customers. The same can't be said, however, about some of his staff. My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a "big deal" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party.I reserved a car for 8:30 am friday the night before. When I came to Enterprise to pick up my car at 9:15am, they said that the car was just having an oil change and it was going to be on its way soon. The car never came. They kept on telling me that the car was coming and I didn't have a ride so I couldn't leave. I asked if they could drop me off so they did.  They picked me up at 11am and gave me a 10%discount but didn't think it was worth it. I will never rent a car from them ever again. They wasted my time!This buffet sucked! You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet. The Rio and Mirage buffets are still far better than this dive. The design and atmosphere is simplistic and strange.  They could have made this place much more Romanequese. It may have been named after a Roman God but the food and atmosphere wasn't even good enough for mere mortals like us.I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. 

They charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. 

There have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their "DIAMOND" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! 

When I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF 

He treated his staff better than his customers.

The food is great!! but I lost my appertise already.One of the worst customer service I have experienced along with crappy cheap furniture. Bought entire living room, three bed rooms and bar stools. Had problem with the stools, took it back and the store blamed me for the problem. CUSTOMERS BE ALERTED THESE PEOPLE DON'T WANT REPEAT CYSTOMERS.Had heard nothing except rave reviews on this place, so decided to check it out.  BIG MISTAKE!  Over priced for the quality.  Mixed "Vegtables" on menu... not vegtables.  Was a veggie.  And if you have a coal burning oven, why would I get some nasty snap peas!  Grilled peppers, squash, eggplant seems to be a much better idea.  I went in the next day to complain and was spoken to by a bartender who spoke extremely dissrepectful to me and never offered to even get a manager.  This place won't last with a $6 burger at Flemmings that KILLS the quality and experience!  Too bad!The Grind on Hayden is a disappointing facsimile of the Grind in Arcadia. In Arcadia, my experiences with the Sweet and Spicy burger, peppercorn burger, and mesquite wings were extraordinary. In the Hayden Grind this afternoon, mediocrity reigned as the barbeque burger lacked any essence of barbeque sauce, which was overwhelmed by the bland mozzarella cheese. The mesquite wings which Arcadia served plain were cooked less skillfully @ Hayden and covered with some superfluous orange-colored sauce. The onion rings were pretty good. The beer selection in both places is very good. I thought I had scored big when I purchased a groupon for the grind. Apparently, not so much. I'll drive to camelback next time.It smelled awesome walking in, so we were really optimistic at the start of our dining experience.  The food was very disappointing.  The catfish was the toughest fish I have ever tried to eat.  The thinner parts of the it were so hard I could not eat at all.  The fried chicken was super dry.  I dont know why they served it to us because it was visibly overcooked.  The marshmallows that I'm assuming were meant for the sweet potatoes were melted on the bun for my catfish sandwich.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly but nothing was brought to our table.  Which seemed a little strange considering I need to use a cane to walk and I was there with an elderly parent- so to have us keep getting up to come to the counter to get the sodas he forgot to give us, then the chicken which came out later, then sauces.  We took our leftovers with us (which there were a lot of) but we just threw it away somewhere else because we were embarassed that none of us liked it and felt bad throwing it all away in front of them.  Seeing all the good reviews on here I might go try it again.  I really like to support locally owned business.  But it was really bad food even though we wanted to like it.The reason why I only star because I came there once to have the rusticity chicken and it was okay even though that it wasn't on "Brazza" the sauces were not right than I came last Saturday to have the paella and I went to Peru once and lived there for three months so I know a little about their Cousine but what I had it wasn't nothing even close I understand that Wisconsin's not the best place for seafood but at least  I had tasted better paellas.. Poor service ,Poor quality, and worthless.used to love this place...they changed the crab they used...which is more like a crab stick...makes the roll taste dry and flavorless. got a shrimp tempura roll not even sure if Shrimp was in it. will not return....Ordered burger and grilled cheese. Fries and drink with both sandwiches. $26 ticket!!!!!  Not going there again.One good flavor out of the ones "available" to test. I think it's stupid how its a juice company and yet you can't try all the flavors they sell, only a certain few. Second if you live in Vegas and are willing to drive to the actual location you can't use the discount code they offer to their online people. They'd rather you spend the money on shipping than give u a discount for actually going there. THIS IS STUPID. Nothing against the place I think it's great but offer discounts to customers who actually show up at your door and not just online orders.Is this place ever open?!  I've gone twice in the past month during their supposed business hours, and it hasn't been open.  What a waste of a drive!  I'll update my review when/if I finally get to try it.THE ABSOLUTE WORST burger I have ever had! The meat patty was so thin I almost missed it. American cheese IS NOT REAL CHEESE and who puts thousand island dressing on anything these days.  All in all just 100% AWFUL. NEVER EVER Again.So my mom and I went here to get pedicures together. We didn't mind we had to wait a few minutes so we could get them done at the same time. Half way through, my mom's technician gets up and goes to wax other clients who walked in after us. This tech was gone for at least 10 minutes while we waited. Unacceptable service. We'll take our business else where from now on.Horrible service. We walked in when it was empty to order food to go for work and it took 10 mins for anyone to even notice us. After reading the great reviews I though the food sounds like its worth the wait. When I got to my job our pho had none of the chicken or meat that we ordered so we only had the noodles and broth. I immediately called back and explained that I couldn't come back at the moment but what their procedures were for this. The guy told me that they were busy so to come the next morning and they would refund me. So I went and the owner Annie went completely crazy shushing me out saying that the guy who answered the phone didn't know what he was talking about and saying she didn't care what he said that she's in charge and she can't help us. I'm always very understanding but the manager clearly doesn't care about her guests.went in to replace radiator for my corvette.  The mechanic was totaly incompetant. mechanic had to disconnect transmission cooler lines, but could not figure out how to refill transmission fluid, or check it. mechanic said it is ok to lose transmission fluid. (about a quart was spilled on floor.)Mechanic installed wrong coolant. I insisted they install dexcool, as per mfr's strict guidelines.  After getting car home, i inspected for leaks, and found that several coolant hose clamps were not tightened at all, airflow baffles were not re-installed but were in the front bumper, fan shroud retaining parts were not installed, air cleaner not installed right, and a 103 dollar plastic air filter retaining clamp was broken in half. 
   I also discovered that transmission cooler lines were now leaking at the radiator connection. (not installed correctly.) When mechanic installed the correct coolant, he mixed it himself with 50% tap water. Now I need to flush the sytem myself, and install a premixed 50/50 dexcool mixture of coolant, or risk engine damage. 
 The managers are friendly and seem to care, but the mechanics are total morons and a$$ clowns. I complained to customer service, and a diistrict manager ordered the manager to refund the total repair, and buy me a new plastic air filter clamp. I still had to take my car to another shop to repair the transmission cooler connectors, and properly check the transmission fluid. (complicated procedure on corvette involving car on lift, engine running, and removing drain plug, and injecting fluid with hand pump.) I would not trust firestone mechanics to work on my lawnmower, let alone my corvette. take my advice, and stay away from these idiots, if you want youre car fixed right. Sure the managers are friendly, but the mechanics are worthless. 
  This shop has only recently opened. Makes me wonder how these guys lost their last jobs, before they came to firestone. I wonder how many customer cars they screwed up at last job to get fired, then go to firestone.I would give this company negative stars if I could. I called in the day before to make sure that JMLTSS had received a payment because I could not remember if I had paid them or not. They told me to come in the next day to see if they had it on record in the computer. It turns out they did not have a record of my payment, but they let me take the first half of the class up until lunch break.  I was told that during lunch break I could try and get a money order. During lunch I told them that I did not have cash on me for a money order and the only thing I had was credit and this is when Jennifer, their front desk person started becoming extremely unprofessional and displaying a ghetto attitude with me because she thought I was trying to get out of paying for the class. She suggested that I even incur fees with my bank trying to take out money via credit card  to pay for a money order. After going back and forth with them about not thinking that a cc could be used to get a money order, I reluctantly went to the Fry's down the street to try to get a money order.I came back upset because sure enough, Fry's would not a take credit card payment for a money order.This was the last day that I had to take my traffic survival school class before my license would be suspended and I was desperate to work out a solution with them even though they were being unreasonable. Jennifer ended up running my credit card through Paypal and I was told I could sit in for the other half of the class. Ten minutes later they told me that they would not accept my payment because Paypal would take two days to go through and they made me leave. They told me they would give me half credit for the class, but at this point I had already made the decision to not go back and find another tss school since my license would be suspended anyway. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a company and I am by no means a confrontational person. I felt that I got taken advantage of and I am shocked that these people run a business like this. I took accountability for my actions, but customers should not be treated like this in any way. I still remember Jennifer shaking her head from side to side and raising her voice at me when I was trying to work out a payment method with her. It is my impression that Jennifer made me go through all that fully aware that I would not be able to give her a cash payment that day and that she simply wanted to seek give me the run around.  Horrible experience!!

About a week later my boyfriend drover me all the way to Stop and Go traffic survival school in Gilbert so that I could take the class again. The instructor was friendly and I was finally able to get my ticket  taken care of. 

Later on I had to dispute the credit card charge that Just My Luck did  through Paypal and I was able to get a refund. Jennifer never acknowledged that she ever kicked me out of class . I had to prove that she never paid me the $60.00 back, and after looking through her records she found out that this was true. I threated to go to the Better Business Bureau to report her if she did not refund my money and she eventually paid me back by check through the mail. 

Till this day I will not go back to Just My Luck Traffic Survival school.I highly recommend going elsewhere to fulfill your driving school or traffic survival school requirements.Was not happy about this place. Very disappointing. The restaurant that was there before was a lot better. Both dishes that we ordered did not taste very well. The guacamole was terrible! No flavor at all. Most likely never coming back.Very disappointing place. Went there since it was close to my house but as soon as I got there a post-it with "back in 15min" was on the door. There was no telling how long the person was already out for. So very disappointed for a place to have an open sign and not be open. Will not go again.This is the second Gordon Ramsey place I've tried and I can honestly say he's the most overrated celebrity chef. A few years back had drinks and food at LONDON in NYC and it was like, meh. Nothing special, just ok and a little disappointing. Shrugged it off and just resigned myself to the idea that it was better to watch him on TV than to actually go to one of his places....then Vegas happened. 

It was late and BurGR was almost the only place open so why not. The place looked great-nice, clean, and modern. Hostess was friendly and our server was really nice. Menu looked interesting and enticing so it seemed like there was hope. 

I know it's a burger place (hence the name - duh!) but the hot dogs looked really good so I decided to order one. Bad idea. It took a little long for the food to come out but that's ok. We were in no rush and our server was friendly. Finally our food came and it looked amazing. My plate was huge, looked great and then I took a bite. It was the worst bite of food I've ever had. It was super salty. I mean SUPER SUPER salty. So salty that I almost spit it out like the restaurant's namesake does on TV. I thought it was me so I took another bite and it was confirmed. BLEH....!

I'm not one to complain to a waiter, have food redone or replaced. When the waiter came and asked how everything was my friend insisted I say something so I did. Our server was apologetic and kind. He offered something else and insisted I pick something else. By then I was so turned off I would of honestly preferred a return but graciously accepted a hamburger. He took it away and apologized and told me I was not the first person to complain and that the kitchen was working on the recipe. Really?!? Not the only person to say this and the kitchen is working on this....really?!? (My guess is that they have the hot dogs custom made for the restaurant.) Sorry, with a big name associated with this place I'd think this would of been fixed BEFORE you even opened the doors.  

Burger came, was decent but by then my taste buds were so blasted by the salty dog it was pointless. (BTW: If you're ever in NY Shake Shack is the place for a good old fashion juicy burger.)

If you go get the burger, forget the hot dogs until they've improved the recipe.The only reason there is one star is because I can't give less - that and the Manager, Benji.

Started out with a 45 minute wait when there were open tables. Seated, waited 20 minutes before the server arrived to take our order. Watched another server scratching her hair / head. She did NOT go and wash her hands. Ordered. Thirty minutes later still waiting for food. Thus far, I am unimpressed.  (Had dinner the other night at Chef Ramsay's Pub at Caesar's Palace. The food was extremely good and the service was friendly, efficient and very well executed).  Food finally arrived after complaining to the useless waitress.  The server that had been scratching her head brought the food.  My burger was overcooked and luke warm.  My husband's burger was cold and overcooked.  The only reason the fries were hot on the top was because they'd been under the heat lamp for heaven knows how long!  We asked for ketchup - never showed up.  We spoke with the Manger Benji - very nice man - who freely admitted that the daytime service at BurGR is awful.  He invited us to return the next time we're in Vegas which we will do but certainly not with the same anticipation. 

 Looking around there were more tables waiting for their food than tables eating.  There are orders stacked up under the lamps waiting. I haven't seen our server even bring out one order yet.

After such hoopla and anticipation over BurGR I am so dissapointed.  The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.  I really like Chef Ramsey's other restaurants - I just hope that he finds out what a travesty BurGR is truly.  It is EVERYTHING that he preaches against:  awful service, awful food and, as far as the wait staff goes, a complete lack of regard for the patron.  I actually saw one of the patrons tip the busboy because he was more helpful than the server.Loved the incredible music and talented singers.  Hated the frequent sexual innuendos and overt sexual references (including a couple "doing it" in a bathroom stall).   Too much crude humor and playing to the lowest common denominator  This overshadowed for me what could have been an awesome trip down my own 80's memory lane.   Was embarrassed that I took my wife to see this, and we left at intermission.Came by last night with my boyfriend, and as usual the employees have closed up shop by 9:30 (although the restaurant is open until ten) and so we decided to try the drive thru. Big mistake. It's now 11:43 the following day and he's currently lying here off work, ill in front of me. It was within an hour of eating but half the meal, that he was vomiting, and didn't sleep at all throughout the night. Wish these stars could go negative. Beyond the unprofessional and completely lazy staff, THE FOOD iS NOT BEING KEPT AT TEMP! PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK! BEWARE! 

And to the night staff of this establishment - you should be reprimanded or fired for your carelessness. He's pointed out after reading the recent reviews that he's not the first to get sick for your simple minded laziness and low self standards.I wish there was a rating below 1 Star.

One word describes this hote....DISGUSTING.

It is gross, filthy, dirty, HORRIBLE.  From the staff to the rooms, elevators, everything is gross.  The only thing good there is Hash House and that is really not the hotel that is a chain of restaurants.

The rooms are disgustingly dirty.  Ceasars, Harrahs, every hotel associated with the Quad should be ashamed.  If you are going to have a shit hole hotel, wait until you fix it up before you open it.  This place is as creepy and dirty as it gets.  The elevators take FOREVER, there is always bottles or wet stains in them, the doors typically don't close either.

I tried to call the front desk multiple times but they don't pick up their phones, there is always a 45 minute line to check in, even at 1am.  They just really don't give a shit, plain and simple.

And if it's Friday or Saturday, just drive to Harrah's and park, the parking lot will always be full at the Quad.

On second thought DONT STAY HERE!  Stay at Treasure Island across the street and have a REAL Las Vegas experience.I was checking prices for cheap hotels on Expedia.  I came across this hotel for very cheap during the week.  It was a MAZE to the parking garage from Las Vegas Blvd!  I'm surprised that I found a spot.  Hopefully I will remember where the car is parked.  I'm scared about that.  I know what level I am on, but I took like 3 different elevators to check in.  

The hotel is under construction.  The line was very long (Late at night).  Hour later I finally was served.  The lady said that there is a $11.00 "Resort Fee".  I'm like, WHAT?!?!  Resort Fee?!  When's my Tee time?!  She giggled.  I said that I wasn't aware of that fee.

I was tired, so I paid it and was going to leave a poor review on Expedia.  I sign in and I coudn't leave feedback on Expedia!  I kept following the links to leave feedback.  The only feedback I could leave was for Expedia themselves (Which I did).  Too bad they got the brunt of my poor attitude.  They received 1 star, and I will not be using them again.  Soooo many places that can get me a deal!

So....  I would read the fine print first!  Their so-called "Resort Fee" is going up to $15.00/night August 1, 2013.

The room is mediocre.  I stayed in Tower 5.  It's an older hotel, so it's not fancy like the Cosmo (Killer place!).

If you want to find a cheap hotel (So you have more $$$ for gambling/etc), you won't save much here!!  They mask it up so you 'think' you are saving.This place is a friggin joke. I live here too. Old rooms , it's so convoluted. It's amazing they didn't knock the whole thing down and start over!! Good luck with the following: parking, the room, construction.  Even for the cheap price there's better options out there.  I asked the front clerk.  It's about a 2 year project to be done.  GOOD LUCK SUCKERS !!Being a newly opened place i figured it would be pretty good, wrong!  We went on fathers day evening and were one of maybe 5 people in the whole place.  we got our food quick which was great, however being that they were not busy there should have been no rush to get it out to us and it was obvious it was rushed.  My daughters chicken fingers looked dried out and kinda gross but being 3 she didn't care.  My husbands eggs were cooked on way to high heat and had a gross crispiness sunny side up eggs shouldn't have and my soup of the day- which our waitress didn't even know what the days soup was- tasted worse then hospital food and the veggies in it were still a bit crunchy...  I left still hungry due to not wanting to finish what i ordered.  I usually love Ihop, but wow, Dennys it is next time!!!I plan to visit New York one day, but if this is an example of their food I'll skip it. We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza tasted like deep fried cardboard with Chef Boy R De De sauce on it. Bland does not come close. Imagine if you took three day old dried bread and put a dusting of ketchup as a topping. 

Wings! Oh my sweet goodness, the Wings!! Take a plain wing. Cook it in its own fat, then drench it in vinegar. Serve. Run before anyone tastes it. There you go. 

Worth skipping. I'm not a Dominos fan, but I'll take one of their industrial pre-fab pies over this place any day of the week. 

Off to go brush this experience off my taste buds with a turpentine/Lysol mixture. Argh!!!Went there the 2nd week it was open and it was beyond bad.

I figured I would give it a 2nd shot but sadly they need to close this hole down.

Food is over-priced and poor quality, staff has a "we don't care" attitude and the management seems to think they are all gods who are there for you to worship and not help the customer.

Why do people post good reviews about this place and rave how great it is when it is pathetic..

Wake up people you are getting ripped off by this waste of space...Where do I start? Well to be clear, I never actually ate here...unless you count my stomach eating itself from utter and total starvation! 

Coming all the way to Matts was a stretch for us, living on the west side and having a breakfast place we already love. But...we had heard great things and wanted to check it out. MISTAKE one. 

We called and were told there wasn't much of a wait. We arrived and were told it should be pretty quick. I think that's the point where they realized we had kids. This place HATES kids. MISTAKE two.

We waited for 90 minutes! We watched parties come after us, get seated and leave while we were waiting outside. And these were parties of ALL sizes. They even LIED to us and said we were next and sat a party of the exact same size that arrived 20 minutes after us. 

We left and went around the corner to the Phoenix Public Market. I doubt that the food here could be good enough to put up with their complete and total bullshit.This only applies to their pho. It's basically hot water, meat, and noodles. There is no flavor whatsoever.called in ahead of time to let them know we had a large group coming in.  few of us get there, I let them know we have more on the way and would like to be outside.  The bar tender was too busy being bothered by us customers to care.  He was pretty much rude to us right from the get go.  we order 2 drinks, gives them too us in plastic cups, my friends ordered after me and all got glass drink ware.  other than the bartender, no one cared that we were in the outside patio, ever came out to check if we wanted food.  After one round of drinks we were annoyed enough to move our party across the street to the bar and bistro.HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!

They have definitely gone downhill from mid year last year. They now make you pay upfront for your meal rather than later like they used to.
They still have the hibachi grill & pho.
The service area was messy and my wife had calamari which was not breaded and cold! The hot & sour soup tasted like it has been there awhile. The meat and chicken were way over cooked ( at least they weren't raw). The damage for this torture was $6.99 per lunch NOT including drinks. Will NOT be coming backMy son ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken along with the Shrimp Fried Rice, which he enjoyed.  My husband was not impressed with the Broccoli Beef.  While I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and the Hot and Spicy Lamb.  The Hot and Sour Soup was mediocre I've had much better and the Hot and Spicy Lamb was extremely greasy.  
The quality of the meals is not what will keep up us from coming back.  It was the fact that as we were waiting for our check my son noticed a cockroach next to my husband's shoe on the floor. Which brought our attention to the reminder of the dining room floor and we saw another one.  Totally gross!!This place is terrible.  The first time I went they couldn't do what I wanted.  Said it was company policy - ok, fine, not a big deal.  I wouldn't hold that against them but the employee I talked to wasn't particularly friendly.

I went in yesterday to get a battery replaced.  I walked in at the same time as a family that had apparently already been in for service and came back to complain about something not working.  We waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came in to help us.  

After they were finally dealt with he came back to see what I needed.  Told me it would be at least 15 before he could help me but checked to see if they had my battery.  He went back outside to finish what he was doing without taking any of my info.  

There were other people in the waiting area so I ended up having to sit under the TV.  I don't know what show they had on but it was Kyra Sedgwick repeatedly screaming and calling some woman a bitch in a terrible southern accent.  During my time sitting there people with kids were coming and going through the lobby, and I couldn't help but wonder why they thought it was appropriate to have this on.   I would have asked someone to change the channel but everyone was outside working on cars.  Don't get me wrong - I don't have delicate ears - but there are some things a responsible business just doesn't do.

The rest of the time was spent listening to the phone ringing incessantly, because, like I mentioned, everyone was outside.  

I brought a book to read while I waited but between Kyra screaming and the phone ringing there would be no reading.  Instead I used my time to Yelp another nearby location with higher ratings.  I found one closer to my house and walked out.

I won't come back.I must be really spoiled by the Wynn & Encore and regret not staying there. 
Upon arriving to the Nobu hotel, there wasn't any bell staff to help with your luggage and when you travel with kids there is plenty of it. After wheeling my luggage through the casino we came to the Nobu check-in - no lobby area, no chair to sit NOTHING remotely welcoming. The elevator was having issues so we had to have the desk people call the elevator with their keys every time we wanted to go up to our rooms. The rooms are cheap and über simple, no electronic drapes, no TV in the bathroom, NO BATHTUB (really sucks if you have kids to bathe), no shower door or even shower curtain (really bad if you're trying to fix your hair while someone is in the shower, steam flattens hair), shower water pressure was HORRIBLE, no double sink in the bathroom, poor drawer space for clothing, THIS PLACE SUCKS, will most likely go under really soon!Good beer and that's just about the only good thingThere are so many things that displeased me with the Hard Rock Hotel. My friends and I thought we got a great deal here because it was 30% off for summer nights or whatever. Sadly, it does not even throw off the hidden fees that get tacked onto your bill. 

The rooms were okay, but the shower was freaking short. I'm 5 ft 2 inches and I was able to reach the top of the ceiling, how is anyone that is super tall able to shower?! 

Anyways, there was a security deposit fee that is non-refundable that is $30. On top of that we didn't notice that there is a $15.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the overall price when you check-out. It came out to like $16.80 with tax each day for this service. The resort fee "covers 2 complimentary rock spa gym passes per registered guest per day, strip shuttle service 10am-6pm 7 days a week, free local and long distances phone calls within the contiguous 48 states valet parking is complimentary and available at all times to hotel guests." 

The only thing that bugs me about this service is that we had to PAY for complimentary services, seriously, WHAT THE FUCK. They don't even mention this at all and leave a tiny card as a little disclaimer where your card keys all. 

Another thing that baffles me is how Hard Rock Hotel's website shows pools that are all lit up and pretty at night. Thing is.. they close off the pool the moment it hits sunset. 

The last final thing that bugged me was that we did get minibar charges and we didn't touch anything at all, my friends and I made sure we weren't even close to the censors, but somehow we still got charged. At least, reception was able to clear that up right away. 

The only good thing was the one worker that opened the door for us while we were leaving. I guess that was the only good service about it and that's probably because he saw how angry we were and how we wanted to get out fast. 

Don't even come near this place when you're considering VEGAS. it's not even near the strip at all. :( You will get ripped off for staying at the Hard Rock, STAY AWAY FROM HERE!The worst hotel I have ever stayed in the States! Avoid this hotel if possible. They have all kinds of hidden fee and charge. Extremely disappointed and unsatisfied!! If I can I will rate it as -5.Wasted an hour of my time  on a beautiful Sunday at Otro. The service was the worst I have had in a very,very long time , repeatedly asked for chips before they arrived and waited 40 minutes for our lunch. Unfortunately  the food was not edible and  we had no silverware .In retrospect they may have been trying to discourage us from eating the awfull meal.I ordered heuvos rancheros and my mouth tastes like charcoal  2 hours later. How do you butcher eggs and beans?The real issue is lack off emphasis on timely service.I can tolerate imperfect food (awfull) if I think the staff cares.I don't understand how this place got the reviews it did, maybe friends and family. It's just another below average mexican restaurant. Same old beans covered with jack cheese, converted rice cooked with tomato paste and canned salsa. The tamales had little filling and the masa wasn't cooked. Look I'm not gonna criticize everything. If your idea of mexican food is cheap canned product covered with cheese and "red or green" sauce this is the ideal place.Horrible horrible.

Came here Saturday night to see Tiesto, but ended up leaving at 1 when being so fed up with crowds and "security" or bouncers, whatever they're called.

Arrived at around 10:30, and went to look for prepaid line, was told it was on the other side because the line was "overflowing". Which when we get to the over flow line, was called back to the original spot we were standing in. There was one small group there ahead of us. At one point in line I overheard two of the staffers talking about some girls tramp stamp, loudly and not discreet at all. Rude. 

Inside, no real standing space. You're either on the dance floor, in a bottle service booth, or in the way. To which one staffer made it his job that night to keep telling me and my boyfriend we couldn't stand wherever we were standing. But whenever it was girls standing there, he had no problem at all.

After having enough of that guy, we headed to the jammed packed dance floor, which was probably smaller than my backyard. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder pushing and shoving.

The worst part was the things that happened on the dance floor. Two girls were so drunk out of their minds, a group of guys were passing them around taking turns making out with them while another guy took photos. Lifting the girls dresses, sticking their hands on their panties, even though the girls knew enough to keep pulling down their dresses and saying no. Practically rape. Fights nearly breaking out, people falling on the floor. Horrible.

When we finally had enough, trying to make our way out, some girl was openly lighting her bong in the hallway. Idk how that made it in but yep. 

Police, fire Marshalls etc. need to look into this place ASAP!  Horrible. 

Oh, and sister ended up leaving at 1:30, and still no Tiesto.Went with 2 other people, got seated but never had a sever come to the table.  Sat there for 30 minutes before we got up and left.  What a joke this place is! There were maybe 5 other tables occupied so it was not busy at all.  Will not be back!Very cold atmosphere. The prices are insanely outrageous. Everything they sell can be bought online for half the price. No juices on display. Just a complete rip off. Don't waste your time.Well this was are second time and I think our last.
It started  off bad and ended up bad. When a manager and a waitress had to apologize,  I counted 6 times, then there is something not cracking well at the old pecan grove restaurant.
Here are the highlights:
Were sat at a dirty table
The ice tea was not fresh even thought she said it is made every morning. 
Traded cloudy ice tea in for coffee and it tasted like it was from the early morning breakfast.
We ordered the BLT with crispy bacon and we got crispy charcoal. So I think you call that a, CLT.
I felt bad for the waitress as she kept apologizing along with one of the managers who actually was the one that sat us at a dirty table and brought us the cloudy bad tasting ice tea.
In talking to this manager about  the issues, she was apologetic with a bit of a defense  in her voice and explanations
We were offered free pieces  of pie and chose the Butterscotch which they did not have.
Went to pay and this manager was at the cash register. She was a space cadet, as she saw us walk up ready to pay and then was ready to allow another customer to go right in front of us. I had enough and had to say something, she again said for the 6th time she was sorry...............really.....really.....really
I have read other reviews on this restaurant and they had their meals comp., and was offered a piece of pie. 
We should have been comp. and give a whole pie, not Butterscotch of course.
I guess we should not fell so bad, two other tables were having issues as they were also offered free pie....................!!!!!!
They may also want to check with the smoking laws and where customers are allowed to smoke. They have a free standing ash try right outside their front door, maybe 6 feet from the front door. I think I read the law states 50 feet from any entrance. Yes, you have to walk through some ones nasty smoke and yes there were two guys standing their smoking as we walked in. Should have been my clue to turn around and get back in my car.I ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger but since I am very particular about how my beef is cooked I asked if it could be  medium rare and she said no problem. I dont like my beef over done. If it couldnt be cooked med rare I would have ordered something else but since that was no problem I went for it.    The burger came and it was very  well done.  While everyone else at my table ate I looked around for my server to tell her.  Finally the manager noticed I was looking around and came over to see if I needed anything.  I explained that the burger was too well done.  He asked me if I wanted another one.  By this time everyone else at the table was finishing up with their food so I said no. I had already waited for so long that I didn't want another one any more.  The bill came and they charged me for the burger that I didnt eat because THEY OVER COOKED IT.   The manager was surprised that I didnt want to pay for the over cooked food.  He said that the policy was that if they didn't take the food off the table then they don't take it off the bill.  If that is the policy why didnt he take it off the table? It was not how I wanted it. It was dry and unedible ad far as I was concerned.
The server was nice, the manager was rude and unprofessional.  I would never go back to this place.  Everyone else at the table said the food was not good. The onion rings were dripping with grease.   The place was very noisy and the bathroom was filthy.  Dont waste your time.I really wish my experience at Zipps was good, (I would have even been satisfied with average) but unfortunately it was miserable! We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole were very bland, and the chips tasted stale. My wife ordered a chop salad with chicken. She said it was the worst salad she has ever ordered! (and she orders salad a lot!) The chicken was rubbery (like it had been cooked in the microwave) and had no flavor, just rubbery texture. About half of the lettuce was extremely soggy. (I'm guessing the salsa that came on the salad had been sitting for too long on the lettuce... yuck!) We also ordered a burger, a kids meal, and a cheese pizza (which our waitress forgot to put in the order.) We received the salad, the kids meal and my burger, and no pizza. Mistakes happen, but when they do I feel the waitstaff should do their best to compensate for their mistake. We were offered nothing. She did ask if we still wanted the pizza? Maybe she thought the two members of our party that ordered the pizza wanted to starve? I tried the pizza, I wish I wouldn't have. It tasted like a pizza you make from a kit in a box. The onion rings that came with my burger were awful! They were lukewarm, and the coating on the outside was chewy. (I have eaten quite a few onion rings in my lifetime, and I've never had an order with a chewy coating. Disgusting!) It's almost like the temp of the fryer was not hot enough, or they had been sitting for too long. My burger was fine. This experience goes down as the second worst meal I've ever had to pay for.Super annoyed.  My boyfriend and I (both under 21) have been there more than 3 times after 11 pm to eat and always had great service. This last Sunday we were sitting there at about 10:55 where we placed our order for an appetizer and drinks, then about 10 minutes later our waitress walked up and asked for our id's, to our unknown knowledge you had to be 21 after 11 pm. The manager then came over and explained to me the law and how other managers failed to enforce this, even though he was the only manager that we have ever seen there...awk. 
So they then charged my boyfriend and I for our chips and salsa which we wouldnt have ordered if we would have known!?...the whole thing was annoying.Is there a rating lower than 1 star??? 

So I decided to stop in on a whim while driving by.  Big mistake.  I walked in and went to the counter to order - had to wait for someone to actually notice me there.  The young girl told me to grab a seat as I decided to eat in.  I grabbed that seat and ordered a glass of water which she brought promptly.  Without a doubt, based on the stale dirt taste, this was unfiltered tap water.  So I look at the menu and it takes me about 1 minute to decide on the gyro... 5 minutes go by.... 10 minutes go by...   17 minutes and FINALLY I catch the attention of the girl delivering food to the only other customer's in the place.  She comes over and asks if I've ordered and proceeds to take my order.... Thank goodness it didn't take as long to get my food because I was starting to shake from hunger.  Apparently I got someone else's french fries with my order - according to the other customer in the restaurant as she was very vocal about  telling me and the server that I had her fries.  Like it's my fault and I served them to myself? It just keeps getting better.... So I dig in to my gyro... It's cold.  Everything is cold.  The meat, the pita.... ? What the hell? Then another couple comes in and they are immediately offered a basket of bread while they wait... Ummm.. I could have used the bread while I was sitting there STARVING, waiting for my order to be taken.  I had to go up front and ask for ketchup for my fries - I got handed packets.. ummm ok. Packets in a 'restaurant'.  Then as I sit down tearing open my ketchup packets she brings the other customer a bottle.  Really? 

Anyhow.. so there I am eating... while I am doing so the girl comes to my table and reaches over my plate to take two of the three empty ketchup packets off my tray.  Why? Over my food? Only 2 of them?  By this point I am just thinking "don't come near me again" over and over in my head. 

Well, she did.  Not only did she drop the bill and tell me "no rush", another girl came by and started resetting the table while I was sitting there eating!!!  CAN IT WAIT?????!!!!! I'M STILL EATING HERE!!! 

By now I'm fuming and know that this was the worst lunch decision I've made... I walk up to pay the bill and provide an adequate tip for the level of service I was given... 1.00 (Lucky to be given even that much).  As I turn to walk away the girl at the front counter decides to make a noise like a cat growl and a comment about the tip.  She's lucky I continued to walk out instead of turn around and verbally lash out at her unprofessional/rude ass.  

First and LAST time I will ever go there... and as far as recommendations... FORGET IT!My husband is from Detroit and was very excited to see an ad for this place. When we went. It was extremely hot. We asked them to turn on the air twice. We could see the temp and it was at 90 in there. They never changed the temp. It just kept getting hotter. We got the Coney Hot Dog and my husband saw that there was a loose meat sandwich on the menu and ordered it. He was so excited! While waiting, I heard the cook start chopping something on the grill. I jokingly told my husband that it was his loose meat sandwich. He said no way. Needless to say, they brought out a chopped burger patty on a hot dog bun. It was awful. My husband said that that's not how you make a loose meat sandwich, he said it was an embarrassment. Not thrilled with our experience!Whatever you do, just take the damn taxi. It's not worth the hour wait. Yes it's cheap but not worth it. Totally not worth it. 

5 minutes becomes 10, then 15, and an hour. It's those damn crooked cabbers that resorted me to this and now I'm regretting it. Crooked cab to the strip $35, normal cab fare $20, this damn slow shuttle $7.25. Pray you get a normal cab.So after seeing all of the race reviews and having driven by this little place, thought we would go see what it was all about. Upon first walking in the door you are greeted by a strong coconut smell. Not bad. And sort of expected. But strong. Then we walked up to the counter where who we can assume was the manager was arguing on the phone with someone and didn't give us a second glance. The cashier walked by us and said we would be helped in a moment. So we looked over a very undescriptive menu. To our right was another employee eating their food. To our left was the owner. When the cashier came back we told her it was our first time there and then she told us "well then wait a second" while she left to talk to the employee eating. We stood there and waited until she came back and half heatedly tried to explain the menu options, only confusing us. I wound up ordering the fish burger and my mother had the "new England clam chowder". I'll get to that in a second. So while this happened the manager is still arguing and the owner is on his laptop. So I go and get some "iced tea". Which apparently translates to "Luke warm tea". It was so nasty and left a weird taste in my mouth. I've had that brand before and always liked it. So I was surprised. All of the tables were filthy, despite the employees hanging around and the lack of any customers besides ourselves. There was trash pieces on the floor. We essentially bused our own table before we could even sit down. Then when our food finally arrived I was told that I basically ordered my food incorrectly for asking there to be no tartar sauce. Not one but two employees came to tell me so. I don't like tartar sauce. On the walls are all of these praises from varying sources! So I thought "well the food should be good!" Upon closer inspection all of the framed reviews are from their Hawaii location. Not the Scottsdale one. Seemed kind of weird to us. But oh well it's a new location, right? All of numbers are super worn and faded and the drink machines look crazy old. Well maybe they were saving money for the decor? So I take a bite of my fish burger and the bread instantly tastes chalky. The fish was alright so I ate that instead. My mom had the chowder and the coleslaw. The coleslaw was bland and gross. Just like cabbage with a cream over it. The chowder tasted like it came from a can. And it had tomatoes. Which is really weird. I was born and raised in boston. I had never seen a "new England style" chowder with tomatoes. So we picked at our food. Cleared our plates. Bused our table. Again. Then slowly made our way to the door. We were completely ignored. No one said goodbye, or even acknowledged we had been there. Bottom line: won't be going back. The establishment wasn't even slightly impressive. We talked about our concerns next to the eating employee who stared at us then walked away completely ignoring what we had said to her.I was so excited to see this revolving type sushi restaurant open up.  I love sushi and being from the Pacific Northwest, these type of sushi places are everywhere.

OMG...the worst sushi I have ever had...so sorry to have to say it.  It was warm...ick, when have you ever had warm sushi? 

Service good.  Very clean.  I hope they get the sushi to a better quality and cold!  Would love to see them make it...but it doesn't look good.Elitist Detail is more like it. If you want to give money to someone who judges you by the car you drive, this is your man. I bought a detail from living social and the customer service was pitiful to non existent from the beginning. 

On the scheduled morning of my detail, he called me around 8:30 am to ask if he could come "way" earlier than scheduled. I replied sure, just give me a call to let me know when you are on your way. I never received a call back, and he showed up an hour before the original scheduled time. Not my idea of "way" earlier.

When he arrived with his assistant, I showed him my back seat and said that I understand if they cannot vacuum up all the dog hair (my car has woven cloth seats, not ideal for a short haired dog, but I didn't know I would be rescuing a dog when I bought my car) His reply was, " Well, I don't know what you are expecting for a coupon." Really??? I'm expecting the same quality of service that you would give to anyone, regardless of whither they purchased a "coupon" or not!!!

While he and his assistant were working on my car, they were overly boisterous and so loud I could hear their conversations inside of my house.....just slightly annoying.

When they had finished working on my car, I asked Mr. Jensen how much he charges for a monthly detail, minus the engine cleaning. His response was, "It would be more financially feasible for you to just go to a car wash." What??? I just drop $100 (including a tip for the jerk)  for a half priced full detail. I chose to try mobile detailing because of the pathetic job car washes do, and the time and expense of waiting for or dropping off my car. But apparently Mr. Jensen is too good to detail my car. He quoted me $60 for a monthly detail, which is less than I've been paying at a local car wash for a crappy monthly detail.

This man is so judgmental and arrogant. Why is he offering coupons on living social if he is not looking for new customers of all income brackets?Do not go here. I actually thought the doctor was good, but the rest of the staff is so horrible it doesn't matter. I went two times the doctor was helpful, but followup and post care was a nightmare. Manny the front desk gives wrong information about needing to come in and payments. They seem to only really care when it comes to getting paid. I had no help with refills for my medication which is standard and was told I would have. The office refused to give me a standard doctors note (which my two previous doctors before moving were more than happy to help with) they refuse to let me speak with the doctor or explain my needs directly to the doctor. They lose files, don't return phone calls, and when i expressed that I did not feel helped, Lynn in a very rude way told me to go else where and hung up on me. I've never been treated by a doctors office this way before, i noticed many of their patients are elderly and hope they are not scammed. bottom line the doctor shouldn't be nice just to get your money but follow through with care. This doctor does not take any responsibility for her staff, but will take your money.The food is ok(for Mcdonalds), but the service is some of the worst I have ever received at any Mcdonalds, They are also out of everything, and I have been ignored the two times I have been in there, Horrible service.  Hopefully this is due to being a new store and they work some of this out.The worst pedicure I have ever had. Their $20 pedicure hot stone massage is a joke! When the nail tech scrubbed my food with the pumice scrubber, she completely skipped my heels! She only did the bottom of my feet which are soft and missed the most important part. When it came to the massage, all she did was briskly put lotion on my leg and squeezed my toe, there was not massaging at all! Then when it came to the hot stones, she briskly rubbed them on my foot but still, no massage! It was so fast and NOT  relaxing one bit. It was not crowded and there was only 1 person waiting for a pedicure. I was done before the woman sitting next to me who started way before I did! There were also 5 nail techs so honestly, there was no reason to rush because they were staffed an only 1 person waiting! I am not really sure what I paid for, I will never go back to this joke of a salon and suggest that if you want a relaxing experience and to actually get your moneys worth, go somewhere else.Horribly overpriced. Live right behind this place and ordered 2 shots and 2 beers and had a $23 tab (before tip). I'd understand the price if I was buying drinks at The Palazzo on the strip, but for a "bar" way off the strip?? C'mon... Furthermore, it took over 7 mins to get our shots and the bar was NOT packed at all and the shots were the smallest shots we've ever been served. At $6.00 per shot, that was a RIPOFF. And they run NO happy hour past midnight. Won't be coming back. Save your money and avoid this place, completely ripoff.Worst food ever!!! The service is terrible and the food is awful!!
We ordered the beef kebab and what we got was a dry too salty beef, 2 spoon of dry and old rice and 3 leaf of salad.  
Worst middle eastern food I ever got!This place has not been the same since it turned into 24/7. Glad my hair/nail lady moved.Devin Luzod is a scammer !!!! Never adjusted just sales pitched and shown videos .. Waste of time  and $we just ordered from here for delivery and a guy named albert messed up on our orders. when we called back to to tell them they messed up he decided to act and speak like it was our fault.. we tipped the driver good cuz it wasnt her failt and she was nice.. 

it sux we always have great service and food from them till nowYelp rarely steers me wrong, but this time it happened. I ordered take-out and was so disappointed. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had, weak and soggy with no crab. The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil). 

The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump. I'll stick to China Chili in the future.If I could give Sophia Fiori negative stars, I would. Please do your research online and you will see they are SCAMMERS!!!! I wish I had....The only reason I purchased from this company was because we had a friend working for their co. She actually drove me to their warehouse where I hand picked the jewels that I wanted. Mind you, I know jewelry and I knew these were not DeBeers or Harry Winston, but they were beautiful pieces, plus I wanted to help her and let her get the commission. I should have know something was up when they didn't want to take American Express! This was the first red flag. I insisted, as this was the only card I had on me, and they accepted it. I purchased the jewels and enjoyed them, but a few months later, my friend told me that she saw the EXACT SAME bracelet I purchased for $18k on a cruise ship (SF sells on ships- another red flag), for $8k! I never had the jewels appraised, so I wasn't sure. I contacted Bernard Bachoura, who claims to be the designer who joined his family's business when he was 16. I was pretty upset, as you would imagine, well Bernard's smug, arrogant attitude did nothing to calm me down. My husband called him back and apologized, saying I was tough, but I honestly did not like the idea of my husband buying me this beautiful jewelry that was actually all a farce- because it was A COMPLETE RIP OFF. In any case, Mr. Bachoura explained that if we got an appraisal we would "see that the bracelet was worth 18k." He claimed he would "stand behind his brand". Really? My husband and I knew this was a false claim, but went and got the appraisal anyways. Guess what:  we got the bracelet appraised (by a leading jewelry co) for $8400.00. So when we sent this to Bachoura what did he do, he disputed our dispute with American Express, never return phone calls, never returned emails, and the only thing he is standing behind now is shadows. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. He may give out swag to celebs to get some press, but the REAL CLIENTS PAY FOR IT WITH SUB-STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.I went here last night with my boyfriend and we were quite disappointed. They were out of guacamole and tortilla chips, and they don't (yet?) have beer as advertised on the website. We were the only customers there the entire time and got a pretty awkward vibe from the two gentlemen working. We will not be returning.I have been dying to check out Geisha House for months because all of the rave reviews on Yelp! My expectations were somewhat higher than usual simply because of all the great reviews. Although, I had an absolutely horrible experience. The server didnt seem interested in waiting on our table. We waited a good 5-8 minutes before she greeted us. I did order some wine which I enjoyed but honestly that was the only good part of my meal. I decided to get sushi and my date ordered a meal. His meal came out within a reasonable amount of time, but we were not impressed. I ended up not getting half of my sushi. I told the server I would just go through a drive-thru and gave up after waiting for them to correct it. Our bill was $70 & I didnt even get my sushi rolls!We checked in last night, 2 adults and a small dog. The lady who helped us check in, was cold...at best. She seemed to judge us by our "driving attire", and not the money we were spending (to keep her employed). She explained that the elevators were "down the hall, and around the corner". After wandering around, and looking inside 3 elevators only to find floors 1,3 & 5...no 2nd floor. After I went back and asked the gal for directions, she apologized for her mistake, and now explained I had to go past the first couple sets if elevators prior to finding any that go down to my floor. 

After a night's sleep, we decided to go to the Casino Monte Lago we read about on the property's website. We walk up to a door with a small sign that read (to the effect of) "casino is closed, sorry for the inconvenience". 

Granted, we chose this property to be away from the craziness of the strip. However, had we known there was no gambling whatsoever on property (meaning I have to decide between 1-being on a schedule for shuttles while trying to relax 2-drinking and staying on the property 3-not drinking, so I can drive to a casino) we would have chosen another dog-friendly property to stay at. 

For our troubles, we were offered a voucher to the spa. Come to find out, it can be used for the sauna (I live on the coast of Cali, hot and steamy aren't attractive to me) or a "clothing-optional" same-sex hot tub. That means I don't get to spend time with my wife, but a bunch if naked guys I don't know. What a way to say, "we're sorry for ruining your trip". 


Trust is everything to me. I no longer trust that when Hilton Hotels says, "this is an amenity we offer". 

I just removed one of the 2 stars I had previously given, due to just finding out THE POOL IS CLOSED!The line was long and food was as expected. They wouldn't give me a cup of water. They said they'd run out of water cups but they had plenty of soda cups... They said they couldn't out water in one. Haha. It's more fun to break the law. I tried two different employees but got no water. Good thing we weren't in a desert.NOT the same as the original locations. Food was not hot and just doesn't taste the same.  Dissatisfied. Very.If I could give zero stars I would. We ordered 4 pizzas and were told it would be 45-60 minutes. At one hour we called and were told 10 more minutes. At an hour and a half we called and were told any minute now. At 2 hours we called again and they called the driver, who arrived about 10 minutes later. It wouldn't have mattered if we had gotten "pizza". Instead we got something that made us all sick. The buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce on it - in fact no sauce at all. Order from another pizza place, unless you like chewy dough and salt.I know they just opened but the food is disgusting. The service is super slow and the staff is extremely rude. I would NEVER spend another dollar or step foot in that place. It sucks because they are right next to the building I work at. STAY AWAY! Its not worth your money or time. Food is crazy over priced and its not even worth it. If I could have given a negative star I would have. Good luck Americas Taco Shop.I had such high hopes for this store to be great. Unfortunately due to poor customer service I have no hopes for them any more. 6 weeks ago we ordered a sectional that was to be delivered in 2 days. Did I say 6 weeks ago? First they couldn't find the sofa portion, then they could only find the right sided chaise, then they couldn't find it again. I had to call each time even though they said they'd call. They have been so poor in communication and follow through. We still don't have our sectional, we still haven't heard back from them. DONT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, YOULL NEVER SEE YOUR PURCHASES. If I could give a negative star I would. My only hope now is that they close their doors and go away.I have since stopped going to this cleaners. This is nothing negative towards the employees that process the orders but the location that does the dry cleaning. On too many occasions now, my shirts have come back in less then stellar condition. They started coming with creases and broken buttons. I don't have the time to send shirts back to be repaired and pressed again. I would suggest finding another cleaner. And to the cleaners, it may be time to do some quality assurance at your factory.I am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending.  We showed up at 5:10 on a Monday evening.  We were treated to a lecture about not having reservations; not once but two times by the same person.  If you can seat someone then do so graciously, I am not there to be lectured that I did not have reservations.  We did not stay, and we will not return.  The menu looks interesting but I guess you need reservations.Here we go. Maybe it has been a while for me hanging out in Tempe. But I will start with this... Paper plates? That just doesn't seem right for a Mexican restaurant. Also, I asked the server for a napkin and she brought me a stack of cocktail napkins. And the chips sure seemed like some kind of Doritos to me. The salsa was ok. I asked if they have multiple choices for salsa and nope just one. I ordered the chicken tacos they were ok. But phoenix market has been flooded lately with tacos shops and burger shops and these tacos were nothing to brag about. Service was good . Server was good. Bunch of tv's looked good. Probably wont go back.DON'T DO IT!!! This place is gross, calamari tasted like  frozen fish sticks :(. Medium well burger was medium rare and zero flavor.  I assume it also came out of the freezer section of Costco.  Hey chef, freezer burn isn't a tasty seasoning choice.Wow... I can't I have to write this review about a place I used to love. 
I just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review... little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. 

Towards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. (Unfortunately, I don't remember her name) She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure (Colposcopy). When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around $200. I explained that I did not have $200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year (2014). She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January.
 
Fortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. 
 
On Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. 
 
This is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor/staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me.  
  
Personally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. 

It's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one..... Tried this place for the 2nd time. They were out of soda. Only had water. They messed up everyone's order. Terrible. I'd give 0 stars if possible.Just witnessed a few Duck Dynasty looking bikers wielding foot long army knives reach over the bar, grabbed bottles of alcohol, and walked out.  But it gets better...they walked back in, sit down at the bar, and are getting served shots.

With 1 waitress, 1 female bartender, and 1 bus boy manning shop, not sure if they saw it or just ignoring it.

Either way, I would not recommend bringing your kids or date here. 

On the food:
Braised oxtail is good

Scallops so-so

Seared prawns were sent back as all of them were mushy and rotting.  Even the Buser said it stinks when he took it away

This place doesn't seem like it would be around after another few monthsMy friend's 30th- got on the "guest list " but still had to pay cover charge- late by 20 min. No one dancing except our group, even the gogo dancers were not into it. We were there on Saturday night around 1230. Asked  one of the employees if it was always this dead- he blamed it on change over between krave and after. Totally not worth the $40 cover. Supposedly after doesn't get busy until 4am.I have been here probably 2 times, each time more disappointment than before. I ordered the largest pizza they had with olives and mushroom. Being the pizza lover my family and I are we got it with high hopes but were very displeased with the results. Each slice I picked up fell into pieces, on top of that it was greasy, bland, and just plain gross. The garlic crust is was literally the only good thing about it.
The second time I ordered a cheese pizza on a Wednesday to be delivered. I waited and waited and waited until I finally just called up an hour and a half later and asked about the status on my pizza. The response was they had forgotten about my order and were right on it. The manger gave it to me for free because of the wait but it still has the same crappy taste but now it came along with bad service. Don't go there. Just. Don't.Had great reviews and a coupon, so I tried Cu still. I went in on a Friday night around 7. Every table had a party seated. 

I order the baked and grilled wings, a scorpion burger with waffle fries, and a bacon avocado tomato grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries. 

The wings came charred black. After one wing I sent them back; they were all crispy black. The waiter offered to have them redone correctly but that carcinogenic burnt taste in my mouth lingered for a long time an I was done with wings. 

Burger was a home made patty. Not medium but juicy. Small patty, there was plenty of just bun and lettuce bites to my burger. 

Grilled cheese came cold with some of the cheese not even melted. Not much bacon, especially for 8$, and I guess it was my mistake for thinking a mushy avocado would be good on grilled cheese. Completely missed the mark.

Garlic fries were bleh. Not good. The waffle fries on the other hand were awesome. 

I really wanted to like this place. I had good service from my waiter Nick. Nice atmosphere with big booths. Maybe I'll give this place one more chance in a few months on a time when it's empty to get the mushroom burger and Phoenix sandwich which looked good, but not likely.It does not deliver the authentic taste of good crawfish..I spend $33.00 on two pounds. They were super tiny and it's crawfish season.  I ordered the spiciest with two potatoes, three corn and four sausage.  

The crawfish were drrrrry and had no flavor with no spice at all. The corn were decent.  The potatoes were biilg gigantic rustic potatoes cut in half. I am use to the small red potatoes the seasoning soaks into those easily.  The sausage were literally four cut small sausages that you had to search in the rubble for instead of whole sausage links.

I will never return. I just got back from Houston so the taste is no comparison.  I just wasted my money and time. Or go to Vegas.

They do not serve liquor either..The bowl of salsa that came out had something strange in it (I was thinking a cilantro stem or something) so I fished it out. I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. The waiter wasn't quite sure how to handle it and couldn't find a supervisor to help him out. With our stomachs turning from the thought of wire or other "extras" that may he included we decided it was time to go. I really wanted chips and salsa too.On top of extremely slow, discourteous  service and 45 minutes to prepare food, the drinks are extremely weak. Had the margarita, had a very slight taste of lime and no taste of tequila at all. (Check out Ztejas margarita, a good model to follow). Three lime slices helped taste, but not much more. The Pinot Noir was my first choice but they ran out of that before 6:30.We attempted to have a nice dinner at Chao. We walked in and did notice that it looked like they weren't quite set up all the way, but decided to still give them a chance. Someone came by and brought two waters with some very melted ice, and he offered no straws. Then the man who sat us at the table came by and took our drink order. We asked for hot tea but again no sweetener was offered. Fifteen minutes later we were still sitting there with people walking around looking busy. We saw two other tables who got there after we arrived get their orders in. We finally decided to get up and leave 20 minutes later. My husband went over to "the server" and gave him $10.00 for the teas. The server didn't apologize for never coming back around to take our dinner orders he just took the money and said nothing. We walked over to BLD and had a wonderful dinner. We won't be back to Chao!Do not live here please! This place has been nothing but problems. Myself and everyone I know who lives here hates it. The management gets nothing done and is always very unhelpful. This place is to expensive for how terrible they treat there residents. If you don't believe me just go there and ask the residents how they feel about the place. I'm not sure why anyone would give this place more than one star. To be honest they probably work there. This place does not care about its residents, they just want your money.I had visited Nekter two other times this week, once in the afternoon and yesterday morning. I went for a third time this morning because their juice is quite good, and also reasonably priced compared to competitors. After telling my friend about this place, she asked me if I had a punch card with them, it's a pretty good deal: spend $25 and get a free 16oz juice. However this was never offered to me, and I didn't know about it until after I had purchased a few juices. 

The reason for the 1 star review is because I walked in this morning before work, and there were two staff members at the register. One staff member was showing the other how to do something on the register, not a problem, I understood this and I'm pretty forgiving, but I was standing there two feet away from them waiting and it was as if I was invisible. I waited some more..........no "Hello," no "We'll be right with you,".........no acknowledgment at all. Feeling super awkward and unsure of how long I was going to be ignored for, I turned around, left the store and went to Juby True across the street.

I totally understand the need to train someone to do their job, but I think it's common courtesy to at least acknowledge your customers. I'm pretty sure I will not be returning here, as their customer service was non existent this morning.I hate to be redundant but Suzie's review from 6/16/2014 is spot on. 

Priority appliance was assigned to fix our dishwasher by our home warranty company. No one ever answers the phones. You are given a few options/departments to choose from when you call and then you can leave a message but good luck getting anyone to call you back uncles you leave a barrage of messages. 

And then when they "schedule" an appointment they call you the day before between 4 and 4:45p and whether you answer or not they tell you they will be there the next day within a 4 hour window and That they will call again when the Tech is on the way and if YOU DONT ANSWER then they wont show up. So you have to literally sit there staring at your phone waiting for their call otherwise if you miss the call it's not like you can call them right back and say you're home. You call them and they never answer and that's ok. They call you and if you miss that call... Well then, too bad for you. 

What is wrong with this company???? 

The most frustrating thing is that we are at their mercy since we are going through our warranty company to get the dishwasher repaired. Otherwise I would have changed to a different company already.This place is just absolutely horrible. Went in to check it out and have some dinner. 45 minute wait not a big deal, decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. I was looked at and past over by 3 different bartenders (presumably because I am a female). Word of advise ladies- we will tip you well also as long as you give good service. Two gentlemen at the bar had to ask the bartender for the drinks I wanted because I was being ignored. 

Buzzer for table goes off right as I got the drinks.  Get shown to the table (good thing I got two drinks at the bar), it took 10 to 15 minutes for the server to show up.  And talk about stupid.  I understand the concept of the restaurant but seriously train your staff better.   We were going to order a bunch of starters (what they call teasers). There menu is not that big.  Ordered soft pretzels,  they wes out.  Ordered pulled pork sliders,  server said I think we might be out,  can you go check so we can make a decision.  Yep, they were out. Asked the server,  what do you have?  She says everything else. Ok.  What kind of fish is used for the fish tacos,  oh we are out of fish, but if we had it tilapia.  (How do you run out of half the items in your menu? ) Do you have any wine?  Yes,  chardonnay and white zinfandel.  Do you have any red wine?  Yes, it's a cabernet, I think.   Food was so so. 

Time to pay the bill, have her $32 in cash asked for the rest to be put on a debit card.  Only puts in$22 in cash and the rest on a credit card.  Called her over,  told her the mistake and she gets mad at us.  Sorry darlin' you were not worth the $10 you tried to pocket.  

Again ladies,  just because we are not interested in your Twin Peaks doesn't mean that you have to ignore us and give us crappy,  no horrific service.  If you givegood serviceyou willbe tipped well.  Gengerally 20-30%.  We are all in the industry and if you worked for me you wouldn't have a job.I'm so glad Scott answered you yesterday Mike B.  Or someone who say they are Scott.  What I would like to know Scott is how do we receive the IPad/Tablet as promised.  I was finally contacted by Cody Powel 5 days ago after writing the company several times and this is what he wrote to me

The thing is we attended way back on February 25th, 2014 that was 5 months ago.  We haven't seen a list come out yet for Bermuda.  So actually how long does it take?  We only had 32 people in our class so we are way under the amount requirement for the gifts.  I would just like to see them honor what they said and provide the gifts.  If you cannot make good on this, it makes it very hard to believe anything else.  Another question I have Scott is where are you and why wasn't you at the 3 day seminar?

I do not know why this is showing for San Francisco CA but we are in Bermuda.Do not rent from Haven homes. they have the worse property management and customer service.they require you to use their pool service but I have a leak on the pump for 3 days now and the owner of the pool company haven't sent anyone to fix it.. its a crazy company managed by unprofessional incompetent people.I'm still trying to get a couple of problems taken care of in the house and we have been here for 2 months. Once they get your money you are on your own. they'll never answer or return your calls. Ryan is the worse realtor I've had to deal with.Really wanted to order takeout,  as I've wanted to try this place since they opened...... But ended up ordering elsewhere as there is no readable menu posted.... FailWorst movers, scammers will charge for a step, will charge $39 fro blister wrap horrible peopleI too was excited that this restaurant opened and I have to agree with most that posted on here.  Each time I come here, now 4 times, the place is not busy most times empty and the waitresses have no clue how to make someone feel welcome or provide service. It's obvious that the waitresses are only there to socialize with each other and if you ask for something you're bothering them.  While  food most times is good it's also  unpredictable.  What a frustrating dining experience.  As good as their pizza is most times, I will not ever be back.Spent like $10 bucks on a salad and drink that wasn't even that good...I could make something like this at home. Not impressedI'm a fan of Guy Fieri, he's from Vegas and I love his Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I was excited to try his new restaurant.  The place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  Went on a nice Sunday for lunch.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  We ordered our drinks and it came.  Flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  I don't know where our server disappeared to.  After that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  Presentation was nice!  I ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- I can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which I recommend on the side.  My son ordered the fish tacos.  He said it was plain and not much flavor.  My other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  It was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  The truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  The server forgot my daughter's water.  She finally got it when our food was brought out.  Service was 1 out of 10.  We ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  When our server came to bring our check and I told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  I don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  Apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  Which I won't.  Did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  Not!  The lunch experience left a bad taste.  We live in Vegas and expect much more from a Strip restaurant especially from Guy Fieri.We received horrifyingly poor service. I complained to the manager about the disorganized fashion in which people were being seated, and a man claiming to be the owner escorted me and my 3-year-old daughter outside, and yelled at me to "GET IN MY CAR, LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK." I've lived in Las Vegas since 1975, and have never received such awful treatment at a restaurant. 

To give the full story, I took my 3-year-old daughter to the Cracked Egg for the first time, and was told it would be a 25-minute wait. There was no place for us to sit in the front, and I saw what looked like a place to get coffee in the back of the restaurant. We strolled back there, and was told (with a bit of attitude) by the same guy who threw us out that if we sat there, the hostesses wouldn't come find us when it was our turn. I got a cup of coffee, and returned to the front of the restaurant... the whole process took less than 10 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes or so, and I asked the hostesses if it would be our turn soon, and they said they called us awhile ago... clearly it was a 5-minute wait, not a 25-mintue wait.

I asked to speak to the manager, and began complaining to her about the disorganized process, when a man identifying himself as the owner approached me, angrily escorted me and my daughter outside, and rudely told us to leave and never come back. I asked several times that he listen to me, and he rudely told me to "look around, you're not the only one here with an infant."

Unbelievable.tried this place 5 times since they opened and each and evey time was an epic fail.

1. Went during morning rush before work, went inside to order a decaf and bagel NOT toasted w cr cheese. Had to repeat my order at least 7 times to the cashier she could not comprehend a simple order for some reason. Then I had to wait 20 minutes for them to make decaf coffee (apparently it came as a total surprise that someone might want something ready during morning rush?)
Then they could not quite grok the concept of an UNtoasted bagel...
Took a half hour all together to get my order
2. Yesterday drove thru and got LARGE iced coffee.
After I drove away I realized I HAD NOT GOTTEN WHAT I PAID FOR they gave me a medium instead but I had paid the large price
so
3. as a test I went back this morn and ordered same and again they tried to pass off a medium  to me but I called them out and they dis ingenuously went oops and gave me a large, so I ask it is a policy to try to rip off customers this way?
also
4. Ordered bagel w VEGGIE cr cheese and (got in drive thru) and after I drove away I discover it is plain cr cheese.

So in conclusion, they have never gotten a single order of mine right, they rip you off and they are ill-prepared and obviously in need of some sort of competent manager.

I predict this location will close within a year since the other location at Tatum & Bell has a competent staff, never have problems with my order thereliving socail buyers beware. This is not her first company kike this that offers terrible service, and only wants to "sell you" on more services. They are terrible to try and get anything scheduled, took me 3 weeks to find a day and time that would work with my schedule, then they don't even show up when they say. I moved all my furniture waited to be able to prepare dinner for my family( as they were supposed to clean my time and grout) only to have them say they would not even be able to show up until after 5 pm. I just cancelled, and told them I would like my money back, and he said to take it up with Living social. Very unreputable company !! and shame on Living socil for not checking them out better. This seems to be a common theme with their "service type" offers.After suffering the mediocrity of Agave, the terse life of Dos Caminos, and the overly authentic Toros, I was super excited to dine here.

Unfortunately I won't get the chance Due to a 'private event' booking the whole restaurant on a Tuesday after work. Nothing like spending millions on renovations and not letting locals access it. 

Thanks Mercadito, we're off to a great start.By far the worst company I have ever worked wit. If you can avoid Charter do so at all costs. Absolutely terrible customer service and SCAMMERS. I have to call every bill I get because they add charges. 
I have had to call about TV and internet about 10 times in 2 months.Service was terrible! I will never return!!! We waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too. People walked in after us and were seated. Not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it. I will not be back.This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.

We started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.

Then came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.

My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.

Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  

Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?

Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!I have yet to walk away from this Barriques location NOT disappointed. Horrible, horrible, horrible service. Slow, unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes! I have the unfortunate fate of working in the same business district as this location, and it is the ONLY coffee shop within a reasonable distance. I now drive 10 minutes out of my way to work to get coffee and breakfast because I refuse to give those people any of my money. Please stay away from this location - this warning comes from a girl who has NEVER written a bad review of any place! Boo Barriques! :(Seemed like a nice place. However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order (because it was VERY loud) we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards. Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this!I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words. I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food. Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food. Save your kids, save your self. Just say no to the evil fake foodTried to purchase some DJ equipment from this company. My order was denied because my billing address for my credit card was different from my shipping address. Really?! I run several companies and have never run into to this. One of my companies the billing address is our PO Box and the mailing address is the store front or what if I wanted to send a gift to someone? I obviously can't do it through Full Compass.  Also why do you offer the option of a alternate billing or mailing address? Doesn't make sense especially in this economy. I'll be sure to send along my $600+ receipt from the company that's okay with a different mailing address.I had an unbelievable experience yesterday. I went to Vin Santo hoping to order some food to go. Upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they "don't do takeout on the weekend". This is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before.  I am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including Michelin rated restaurants. Shocked, we went to Villa Dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Your loss Vin Santo. We are never coming back.Crappy customer service.  I was the only minority in the store the whole time (wearing Ann Taylor clothes I had previously purchased at other stores) and these biotches followed me around like I was going to steal something.The prices are outrageous.  I went in to mail an 5x8" envelope with a few CDs in it.  They told me it would be $16.95.  I went to the post office:  $4.95.  

Don't bother unless you like shelling out a few extra bones.If I could give this course no stars, I would. WORST customer service experience of my life. Not only was the manager a complete jerk the whole day, the beer cart girl was lazy and snotty. She literally made a Starbucks run for the employees while she was "working." Not only have they lost our company's business for our annual golf outing, but we will never go back for golf league ever again. If you are looking for a good local course in that area, try Lake Windsor Golf Club or the Oaks. Much better courses and they are busy because their staff is professional. Obviously, Sun Prairie Golf Course got the employees who couldn't cut it at a good course.I hope that a sinkhole opens under this nuisance.  The lack of noise barriers and the racing of unregulated unmuffled cars makes this audible for miles around on Sundays in the summer.  If this was in any other city it would have been closed long ago for noise and pollution inside city limits.  Hopefully the new assistant living community right next door will complain enough that it gets shut down.No vegetarian options, and staff always too busy and not personable.We went here to pick out fabrics for a quilt. We used a few tables to pick out color schemes and see what we were working with. The worker walking by actually said to us, "You ARE going to put that away, right?" I was so apauled. Then when we went to get all the fabric cut the lady was also very unfriendly and just had poor customer service in general.Paradise?!  Absolutely not!   This place is a joke.   We've gone here a few times and each time confirms the bad experience preceding.   This place just does not serve up what their name implies.
When I go to a place called Cheeseburger in Paradise I expect something above and beyond the regular burger down the street.  Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names.   Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant.   
I was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries.  Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, "good enough, let's go make some money".
Our burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  
I would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.
If you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.  Last best burger I had was at Great Dane, maybe try there.   But I have had lame burgers there too.  Let me think, ummm,  
If you are still reading.... DON'T GO HERE.  Look elsewhere.I was wary about going here but now I know not to ever go again. The atmosphere was fun, our waitress was good, but I gave it one star because I got food poisoning from this place. I ordered the fish and chips and was very sick (stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, gas) that night until the next couple days. It was horrible. I know it was from the food at Cheeseburger in Paradise. I will never go there again! I don't want others to get sick so that is why I am posting this negative review.disappointing.

server was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.

we ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.

mid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.

however, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.
i got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.

my beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.

overally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's.  
bummer.Disgusting!  I'd rather eat McDonald's over this place!Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star.There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be "Mexican." That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a "Mexican Restaurante" just because there's an "e" at the end of "Restaurant." 

After my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want "Mexican." It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. 

This place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine.Was not feeling well yesterday so I ordered some food online for delivery from Chang Jiang.  Originally I though I had enough cash to pay for the order but realized as I was finishing my online order I'd have to pay by credit card.  I took the $23 and threw on the table next to the door so I could tip in cash. When the guy delivered,BTW he was in my neighbors driveway about 2 feet into his lawn, I grabbed what I though was a $3 tip.  Woke up this morning and realized that I had given him $23 instead of 3.  I forgot to remove the $20 bill when I handed him the cash. I didn't look at it, like I said, I was sick.  I called this morning to and began the conversation with him like this " Hi, you delivered food to me yesterday on ____ St. and I think I may have mistakenly given you too much for the tip.  He started yelling in to the phone that I gave him a $3 tip not a $23 dollar tip.  He was ranting and raving.  The weird part is that I had not even said the amount I though I had mistakingly tipped him. I was talking calmly and he was ranting that I also had stolen his pen from him(a 20 cent pen!)  
Why would someone react like that to a simple inquiry??I was not accusatory, I was simply inquiring.  And then for him to say he wanted to come over and pick up the pen I had taken from him? WTF?  
Ever heard of Karma dude?Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores.I paid $17.50 for an inside-outside cleaning and was given a dirty car. After agreeing that the car was dirty, the manager refused to have them vacuum it again.This needs no explanation.I have stayed here before without any issues. This last stay of 6 nights was a different story. The first night we had loud and rude neighbors. The sixth night and seventh day our room smelled like pot. The cleaning people did a crappy job and the hallway looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in quite a while. I will not be staying here again.I would not recommend Joyce for bridal alterations. First and foremost, she is not friendly at all. I put on my dress for the first time since I bought it at her store, and was so excited about it. She made me feel rushed and took away from the moment. Then, she charged me $200 for bad alterations, which I ultimately took to get fixed for $100 elsewhere.Gross, disgusting, rip-off. This place makes me seriously doubt the Madisonian palate. I had a cheeseburger from here a few nights ago. I asked for medium - which to Monty's means completely raw in random spots. Aside from the random rawness, the burger tasted like it was over seasoned with pepper. The meat was of absolute shit quality, the bottom bun was soggy (probably from undercooked meat juices), and I did get it to go. Thanks for the ketchup and mustard packets - now that's classy. I have no reason to set foot in this place. Every experience I've had up to point makes me wonder why I bothered to return one more time. Maybe there's something wrong with my palate, but to be honest, I'm pretty certain that there's not. East side institution? What a joke!Always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience.  Wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it.  About 5 minutes later the same waitress brings out a huge fish plate for the lady next to us.  We are like " What the HECK" ????  Needless to say if we are not good enough to eat what anyone else gets, then we are taking our business else where.  The food that we got was not that great this time anyway.So, it's not like this place was ever gonna make it outta my e-gutter, cuz there's nothing really redeeming about it. You know, sometimes a craving makes one act desperately... sometimes against one's better knowledge. Nevertheless, I make my way to Monty's one fine day, craving some sort of ice-cream based treat, similar to a beverage, but of a thicker consistency. Nothing special, just some plain old ice cream and say, caramel. It was $6.38?! Okay, so I go into a Vincent Vega state of mind, zoning out while the shake's bein' made thinking to myself "Did I just order a six-dollars n' 38 cent shake? Sure did. A shake? Milk, ice cream, caramel? Uh-huh. Six-dollars n' 38 cents? Yep. They don't put bourbon in it or anything? Nope. Just checking... smh... Whoa, WHAT?! When it came up, it was in a small, flimsy styro cup, with a sad lil' wafer sticking out the top. Wait... did they just charge me like that much for this??? Ugh! I was so pissed, I told em' keep it, n' got my money back. I can get Culver's or Michael's for like, way better... Even the Chocolate Shoppe, or like, buy your own pint and a gallon of milk, stir in some Smucker's flavoring and have change to spare... I don't even know why people like this place. Dude, seriously...I wouldn't even put a star. We bought fish from them and asked their "fish specialist" if the fish we selected will get along. Of course she said yes. We have had our fish now for 3 weeks and one is obviously get attacked by another fish! Well petsmart thanks for that! Tetras are aggressive fish and attack others. Maybe they should teach their employees what they r talking about! No way am i going back to them! So uneducated and to top it off the woman that helped us made it seem like we bothering her!  Get it together petsmart! Ur losing customers!This is the worst Chinese food I have had could not even finish meal...ordered general tso's chicken with egg roll.  I do not recommend this place.I set up an apointment on the website. they called me an hour later to tell me they had over booked without checking their online apointments.  Why even have an online apointment booking service if your store reps are too dumb to even check it?Mr. Roberts is not a place I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out. Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences.

My first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. 

My second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. 

Free music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:
- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination
- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP
- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck

You probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.I see that all the negative reviews for this business have been flagged. To those thinking of trying this establishment: READ THE FLAGGED REVIEWS. You will have a far more balanced and accurate assessment.Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain... the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning. I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door.I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.

The Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.

I arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. 

The employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.

When I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could "saw" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.

Because of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.

Even more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. 

Returning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was "f-ing out of here" because he had "the longest f-ing day of his life" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. 

I now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...We are adding onto our kitchen and went here to get cabinets and countertops to match our current cabinets. 

We worked with a lady (Penni maybe?) for about an hour and she said she would draw up a quote and get back to us that evening. After we didn't hear from her in a week we gave her a call and were put on hold, she said she didn't get to it because she was working on some 'really big' projects (ours wasn't big enough to pay attention to apparently).  When she finally got back on the line she changed her story and said that our information was now lost but she would find it and call us right back. That was two weeks ago and we haven't heard from her since. Unfortunately they were the only dealer in Madison who carried the cabinets we have and we will now have to go out of town to get our cabinets/countertopsWas hoping to get the right parts for our leaky shower handle.  Its a sad day when YouTube is more helpful then these employees.  As my wife points out, the first guy wouldn't even look away from the boxes he was breaking down.If ever there were a real live grinch, It would be the hag (presumably the manager) working 2 days before Christmas.  I was going to buy a bottle of wine, and she came over to let me know in a nasty voice that if I were buying alcohol, I better hurry up.

Well I did, and because the cashier was seriously slow, it was 9:01 when it was my turn at the register.  This woman came over, and snatched the bottle away from the cashier and said something to the effect that I should have hurried up, and they didn't sell alcohol after 9.  The cashier looked really uncomfortable, and mumbled some excuse.  

What is it about the holidays that turns people into complete assholes?I was excited to work with Carl at my tasting.  I had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad.  My 30 minute trip turned into a 40 minute trip and I was 15 minutes late.  I figured I could talk to him when I got there (rather than try to find his number while driving) and it wouldn't be a big deal.  I got there and was informed he had left for the day.  Ummm ok.  Kind of shady considering he had my number and could have informed me.  I decided I would give it another shot - maybe there was a good reason.  I called a few days later to reschedule and left a message.  Several days passed with no response.  I get that I was late but I am a customer.  I was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional.  He could have said he has a late policy, wasn't available, or said anything at all.  What a waste of time.This is really only a half-revue, because I never ended up eating here due to the following:

I got their menu in the mail and it looked good, so I went to see the place. The building exterior should have been a big red warning, it was grungy. Walking up to the front door you notice the absolutely filthy windows that are so dirty and smeared you cant really see through them. I went in and noticed all of the pealing wall paper and filthy floor corners and table feet, then there was the terrible smell permeating the place of rancid fishy frying grease, it almost made me sick--I had to leave.

 This place is dirty!  I have worked in food long enough to know that if the front of the house is this bad then the kitchen is going to be ten times worse. These people clearly have scraped this place together to try and make a buck and nothing else.

I find it mind blowing that this "restaurant" can even get a passing score from the Dane Co. Health Dept.Nice people. Not enough staff to accommodate walk-ins that they advertise for. Pretty sure Andy (technician) does not know how to do shellac. Didn't have all the bottled products. But said each product line is different. Placed my hands in the drier and the polish bubbled and my hands began to sting. I said I don't think this right seeing that I've had shellac done before. He said just put the tips of your fingers in. Still in pain I declined to go further and asked to have it removed.Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.

I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open "sometimes" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. 

Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. 

Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say "Excuse me, miss?" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us "good luck". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. 

The front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back.Come on, Safeway.  You are pretty much the only game in town for downtown right now.  You would think your corporate office would recognize this and remodel and class this place up a bit.  You have people who have money to spend living all over downtown Phoenix now.  The store needs to clean up its act, improve its customer service and cater to a new demographic emerging downtown.  If I had a new better choice downtown, I would never step back in this rundown location.I shop here because, it is the only place to get what I need in biking distance.  9 out of 10 times,  I am overcharged.  On my last 2 visits it was for over $4.  I make it a habit to go over my receipt, near customer service to collect my inevitable refund.Unfortunately, this Safeway is a few blocks from my house. I've been coming here for 3 years and never had any issues here besides the occasional person asking for money in the parking lot. Being the sucker that I am, I usually give it to them. 

Today was different. As I waddled my pregnant self towards the cashier with my antsy 16 month old in tow, I noticed the cashier giving me a death stare. Whatever, I shrugged it off. We all have bad days. Then, as I started to pay, she said to the little girl with her mom behind me, "Oh good you only have a few items because this is supposed to be an express lane." With another death stare aimed in my direction. As I looked up, I noticed the 20 items or less sign. I apologized and was only met with more attitude. The little girl behind me asked if she did something wrong and the cashier said "Oh no honey YOU did nothing wrong." 

I went home and counted my items. There were 22.

It was an honest mistake but the way the cashier handled the situation was totally out of line. All because I got into the wrong lane by accident with two items over the limit.I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my "I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends" template.
 
 Majerle's is one of those experiences.

I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.
 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.
 
   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. 
  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. 
Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.
Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.
 If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.Way too many fucking issues.   Lets start with the customer service when you call for a cab.  Unprofessional, talk in slang.  I called for a cab and then got a call telling me my cab was there, went downstairs never saw the cab.   Called the taxi service number and they kept insisting that i was the idiot n said well the cab is there waiting for you.  Puts me on hold and tells me 5 minutes later to tell them what im wearing.  I said a black shirt and why is that relevant.  Lady says quietly we're going to send another cab.    I said another cab? There wasnt ever a first one.  She insisted yea there was until she finally admits 30 seconds later yea sorry he wasnt there.  How the fuck can u call me to tell me my cab is waiting downstairs when they werent ever there.     

Now my actual can driver.  First thing he asks can u pay cash? I said sorry i only have card, then he goes, " can we stop by atm?"   I said no because im already late enough because of your company.  I know its not your fault but i need to get to te tempe campus for a meeting.    Thia fucker still asks to stop at the atm cause its 2 blocks away.   He doesnt fucking understand i dont have time.   Then asks for directions to tempe campus.  Idiot gets lost and asks to borrow my phone as gps. 

Fucking whack.It is old.  Walls are paper thin, it's almost like the noise from the hall and other nearby rooms is amplified.  Is that even possible?  The room did appear clean.  No security at all, just a young girl behind the front desk.  Doors to both streets wide open and vagrants milling around the openings, lounge, and lobby.

The worst part is the "manager".  Shortly after checking in (mid-afternoon), we decided this is not going to work.  We took our luggage back downstairs and turned in the key, leaving the room exactly as it was when we arrived.  The desk clerk called the manager, who said we would be charged one nights room + a $50 early departure fee.  We asked to speak with the manager and were told she would not talk to us.

Everyone else says this place is cheap, but a $170 charge for not even staying there seems a little pricing to me.  We are no having to dispute the charge with the CC bank.I went in for a simple, everyday, ordinary haircut. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE (that's $273.00) later, I came home with products I just HAD-TO-HAVE pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist, the shampoo girl, the facial girl, the counter girls, who just wouldn't take "NO" for an answer and are very well-trained to "put you on the spot" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you, and "trick" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales. Jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut. She neglected to trim the sideburns, ear, nose, eyebrow, and neck hair, even though I asked her, to which she responded, "We have people who do that!" (for an extra charge!) and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas. WTF? Are you kidding me here? REALLY? On the lighter note, I am getting a so-called complimentary facial. Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money!I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here.

I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The "chips" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. 

Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field.I received the worst service of my existence at this establishment - absolutely awful , uncaring and embarrassing. Our group of 17 arrived at 11am before the rush for a retirement party. Shortly thereafter orders were taken, and others arrived about 15 minutes later and there orders were taken. All were served except me. Even those with late orders- my order was nothing special tuna melt.  Others who ordered the same received there food completed it and still nothing for me. When approached by the manager/ jerk on duty- was told we will get to it.  How awful- it makes one not want to attend large luncheons .  Pass the word don't go to this establishment.

Thanks much,This place should just shut down.  Went for drinks before the TOOL concert and they had 4 people working...REALLY?  Waiting for 10 minutes at the bar, gave up and went inside, waited for another 15, nothing...They didn't even have tub girls set up....Bad planning.  We went down the street to cooperstown and although they were slammed, they had servers and we were able to get beverages before the show,  I would never go back to jackson's again.This used to be on my very short list of "favorite" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different).  

The crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm.  I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty.,  Loved it.  

I am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake.

See my review of SENS.  That place just keeps getting better and better.  I am addicted.  We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food.Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great. 

The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..

Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.They messed up our reservation didn't get to eat...had to leave to get to Comerica after 30 minute wait...COBBLER FRAUD. Ok, your calling yourself a Cobbler shop (and who does that), yet your admitting to me that your peaches are not fresh, but "hey it tastes like it does huh".  I'm glad that I just asked for a taste of the cobbler to avoid getting more riled up and then luckily asked the nice lady about her peaches. How cheap are some places and then it was obvious the sample had been nuked because it was microwave hot and not fresh out of the oven. Then I'm thinking, hmmm I never had a frozen apple before, the apple cobbler must be fresh right - apples are like 10 cents each. But to my horror, those apples are also canned, frozen or otherwise not fresh. All of this could have been avoided if I never stepped foot in the place and just stared at the sign. Karim doesn't make cobbler, Grandma does, Karim just thinks he can call himself whatever he wants - oh its cobbler allright, but granny would be rolling over in her grave at these frozen, canned and nuked frauds.I wouldn't recommend this place. I have to admit I didn't move here, I went somewhere else but when I toured it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The girl who toured me left me alone in the office for 20 minutes to fill out my own information while she ate lunch and watched tv on her computer. When I told her what I was looking for she said they were full and she couldn't show me anything. I practically had to beg her to look at the place. While the apartments were ok, I wouldn't recommend it based on the crappy service.I don't know why I keep gravitating back to this HRC location because it's always been just blah at best. Last night's dinner was no different.

Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game. 

The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.

Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them. 

Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*

Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.

It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I"m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one. 

Can't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting!
How hard is it to make a blended drink?
Sorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up.Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here.Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again.Need better phone service attempted to place a call-in order but didn't get anyone to answer after calling 2-3 times, pathetic.Went to central ave location. Dry pulled pork,you NEED teeth to try to eat it,rubbery,bun was soaked on the bottom with? Won't go back,waste of money,tables were dirty too.Disappointing to say the least. Was looking forward to wine, friends, conversation and a little nosh after the artwalk...what we got was surprisingly poor customer service that became downright passive aggressive (scratch the passive) after we received a pizza that wasn't to our liking. The waiter was so upset that we didn't want mozzarella cheese on our $10 goat cheese pizza that he brought out the cook to confirm. His manager then came by our table to tell us that we, the customers, should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese. (Oh really astute one?) 20 minutes later the manager returned with a pizza drowining in goat cheese and we were informed that we should be happy because we were getting "a bang for our buck". We felt so harassed by the wait staff because of this stupid $10 pizza that we actually feared they vandalized the food (yes, you know the feeling of wondering "did that waiter spit in my dish"?). We left confused by the entire experience. I would never never never never never go again and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague.Unfortunately, they are out of business.  Looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago.  I have eaten there twice and it was very good. Don;t know why they closed but they had a Thank You banner posted for their customers.  
Too bad.I was really disappointed at my experience here. It looks nice enough, kind of like a Hard Rock Cafe. The wait staff were dressed comfortably, even if they have to wear eyeliner stuff under their eyes. They were very nice. That's about it for the good stuff. When someone orders the Big Unit (made famous by Man vs Food), a super annoying bell goes off and all the wait staff stop what they're doing and yell "BIG UNIT!" That got old after the third one. I definitely couldn't work there. The big disappointment, though, was the food. I got the BBQ sampler thing and my husband got nachos. The tortillas were soggy and when you picked one up, everything slid off it so all you got was soggy wet chips and no toppings. Even when you scooped it up with a fork or whatever, the toppings didn't taste very good. As for mine-it all tasted like (and had the texture of) stuff that had been cooked in a boil-in-the-bag meal. The sauce was SUPER sweet, and none of the meat had the slightest flavor or appearance of having been even wafted through smoke. All I really ate were the fries, and they were the battered kind, which are gross. All in all I was super, SUPER disappointed and won't be back OR recommend this place to others.Friends don't let friends fly US airways . . . Seriously!! Pay the $10 $20 $50 for a better airline horrible customer service not even offered a food voucher for their mistake that has me here waiting til 641pm got here at 9am o_OOf course the Billy Joel Concert on June 1st was super-awesome featuring probably one of the most creative musicians to ever be born on this planet.  Those fingers on the keyboard were nothing but utterly amazing not to mention listening to those great lyrics that he created.  But let's talk about the US Airways Center AND the selling of beverages.  I could understand scamming people into buying a 10.50 beer because you ARE at a concert and that's what you do.  BUT------ BUT-----  $6.00 for a bottle of water??? That is beyond the pale of greed--- People in Phoenix heat NEED water before they dehydrate.  The body in these Phoenix temperatures is in a constant state of dehydration even after being in the arena.  I would pay 3.50 for water still knowing that the greed factor is in play, but realizing that my body (our bodies) need water.  So scam up the beer, the liquor, the food (that's a whole other review), but don't scam the water. Not in PHOENIX.So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a "better" idea and suggested Athenian Express.

As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)

In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.

We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.

Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658

As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of "gyro meat" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.

I move on to my side of potato salad.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283

Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.

Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.

I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it.I needed a place to crash for the night on a drive from Carlsbad Caverns to L.A., I made this booking while I was driving. I stayed here a few years ago and it seemed decent enough. This time it was not. When we got to our room my wife found dead roaches in the bathroom. Big ones too! I went to the front desk to let them know, they tried to give me another room. I told him that I wanted to check out instead. Didn't give me a refund since I booked through expedia. I didn't care, there was no way i was staying in this roach motel. I would rather drive the 370 miles home instead of sleeping in this place. Fortunately I found a Red Roof Inn a few miles down the road for the same price. No roaches there.I have eaten here many times and have not been impressed with the taste of the food or the prices compared to other places. 

Today we went for lunch. 

My veggie burrito was almost $6 and not very appetizing. 

A co-worker was very disappointed also. She ordered a side salad for $3.99 and what she got was a side of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cilantro/onion (which we would have told them to leave off had we known they were going to put it on a salad), cheese, tortilla chips and a packet of ranch.  It seemed like a bunch of toppings thrown together with chips and ranch dressing. 

I would recommend Ranch Market (16th St./Roosevelt), Ritos (14th St/Roosevelt) or Los Charros (10th St/VanBuren) instead.Soooo disappointed - been going here for years for the guacamole salsa, and tonight we find it's no longer there.  On top of that, the shrimp burro which is my all-time favorite now comes full of green and red peppers and onions and very few shrimp.  The menu does not say anything about green and red peppers, and when we went back up to the counter, we were told the menu has changed even though the changes are not noted on the posted menu and they weren't happy that we didn't like the changes.  After all these years of going there - not again!!!!!Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar
Mongolian beef had a pound of sugar

Gross, gross, gross.
Thank god we only stopped by while road tripping.. 

Ick

Update: im close to throwing up from that gross taste of sugary (whatever the hell they used in that "mongolian beef" sauce). Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong.  This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food.Total and epic fail.

I've attempted to go to this practice twice.
I shoulda learned after the first failed appointment- however, the convenience of their location coupled with my laziness made me go in for a second attempt.
Shame on me I guess.

The first appointment I had with them was "rescheduled" about an hour before my appointment to a different day altogether.

The second appointment I had with them was actually made for the Tempe location (when I specifically asked for the Ahwatukee location), and then when I tried to reschedule something- they didn't have anything with a doctor for another month.

Can't imagine actually being sick or super preggo and dealing with these types of issues!  Thus, I'm taking my vagina elsewhere.Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!I just order a collar for my dog. They have a great site which is easy to navigate. I checked the receipt and noticed not only a shipping charge of almost $9 but there was a handling charge of $7 on top of that. I called customer service and they explained that the handling charge is place on purchases under $60 and that covers the trouble to pick the smaller orders and cover the cost of the packing materials. I then said that I didnt realize that you use more shipping suppplies on a small order (collar) and I didnt realize that it was more troucle to pick a small order since they only said that they charge a handling charge on small orders under $60. You decide for yourself........................ Yes its my fault for not checking this prior to hitting confirm button!Mid century furniture is supposed to be warm, welcoming, and approachable. Not here. Almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it: "do not touch" or "do not sit". It felt more like an overpriced museum. 

When I asked the owner about all the signs, she said "I don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars I can't afford. People who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on." I'll never waste my time there again.I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).

I walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more "attention grabbing" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).

I don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.This place used to be really good. They made the best tacos (which they don't make anymore) and green chili. The green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners. They have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down. This place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood. Close your doors and move on.Had a hitch installed on my Subaru. Paid in advance and made an appointment time for 7am weeks in advance, and confirmed by employees.

Was specifically told it would take no longer than an hour, but having an got and a half availability would be safe just in case. Three hours later I still don't have my vehicle back and it didn't look like that'll happen anytime soon. No recognition from staff that this is an issue. I was told "ten more minutes" 45 minutes ago and they are still soldering wires.....

This is a 45 minute job to do! Not a good sign that they know what they're doing, and they certainly don't care about service expectations.

Poor job, UHAUL. Don't use this location.I've only been to Jugheads for Sadisco, the goth/industrial night, and I wasn't impressed. Jugheads isn't as much a bar as a series of fences, ramshackle walls and bits of trash. I don't know what the drink prices are like, because I've never felt comfortable enough to have a drink there.

The parking lot is a mess, and I'm surprised there isn't a crash every night. There isn't much room to move, and it's poorly lit. If you do go, try parking in a lot west of the bar, near the Delhi Palace. There's lots of parking there.

During the last Sadisco Fight Club, an amateur brawler was knocked unconscious and couldn't be revived. That resulted in a visit from the cops and paramedics. The bar was shut down, and my $15 cover went to waste. 

I likely won't be back.My 1st visit was an oil change for my Wife and once the bill was ready  I went over the bill with them and question what the additional charges where, they took them off, but that's pretty shady. My 2nd visit, took car in for check engine light, diagnosis was a O2 sensor, had to pay a $89 diagnostic fee up front, never had to do this before after it was all done cost were around $300 total. Now 3rd time acceleration issues and I really didn't want to go back to them but my repair shop was closed. So begrudgingly I did, they could not figure out the problem told me I should see my dealer. Took the day off and took my car to my guys at Granite Reef Repair in Scottsdale, they took care of it like it wasn't an issue. Just my opinion but Pep Boys are a shady company, overpriced and for the most part just like Sun Devil Auto repair scams.. I won't go back and I'm happy to let everyone know why.Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!This place is an absolute NIGHTMARE. Also, disregard any reviews from prior to June/July of 2012 as this complex was under different management back then. 

I lived here for 3 years under BRE and almost always loved living here. Ever since renewing with the new management, MEB, last year I've been miserable. 

I was looking to upgrade from a 1BR to a 2BR and was instantly offered a great location in the complex with promise it was fully upgraded at a specific price (by Tomas). Two days later I got a call from the front office telling me I actually could not have that apartment as they had also offered it to someone else... and they would be giving it to the other people, not me - without explanation to why. They, however promised to find me another location. 

When the new location was determined I got a call but was told I wouldn't be able to see it until 10 days prior to my move in as it was currently occupied. The manager, Pam, promised that the unit was FULLY upgraded with a fireplace and new cabinets and laminate floors.  I was nervous to wait until so close to my move date but I  still trusted the new management group as they seemed eager to keep me in the complex. HUGE mistake. 

On my tour through the unit it was a disaster. The floors were stained. There was a terrible infestation of ants. The cabinets were so old and disgusting and the entire kitchen was so filthy it actually smelled. Even Carolyn (who was showing me the unit) seemed disgusted. 

At this point my current apartment was completely packed and ready to go only to now be told there were no acceptable, livable apartments in the complex for me to move in to. I was in a tight spot - I had very little time to look for another place to live and had to be traveling for work for the next 3 weeks. I felt stuck and dependent on the management to find me another location in the complex. 

I finally received a call from Pam that another location would be available for me to view and make a decision. When I came to view it Pam pawned me off on Carolyn to show me the unit (it was more important for her to go to lunch than to diffuse an already messy situation). Carolyn pleasantly obliged. The unit, to my surprise, was much cleaner. The carpets needed to be replaced which she assured me would happen. The cabinets were not upgraded and were stained as were the counters and the rent was higher than originally discussed. We reached an agreement to bring the rent back down if I didn't make them upgrade the kitchen (as usual, I got the raw end of the deal). When I viewed the unit I pointed out the loud noise coming from the apartment above me and mentioned that I would not be able to put up with that even during the day as I often work from a home office. I was told they would notify the neighbors someone would be moving in below so they were more conscientious of their noise.

After moving in I filled out the extensive "pre-existing problems" sheet with items that included overly patched walls, obvious flood damage on the ceiling as well as near the sink, scratch marks in the laundry room (even though I was assured this unit was previously pet free as I am VERY allergic to animals - again I let it go as the carpets were replaced and I just did a deep clean when I moved in), stained counter, stained cabinets, stained refrigerator, stained showers, rusty washed and dirty/damaged dryer. When I turned it in they made no offer to come correct any problems (something the previous management did when I first moved in to my first unit). 

The upstairs neighbors were never quieter than the day I saw the unit and were often MUCH louder. They played loud music, they dropped cigarette butts off their balcony onto mine, they threw garbage and food over their balcony. Every time I complained I was promised action that never seemed to come. At one point, after calling security on their loud noise after 2am I heard the security guard tell them it was "the neighbor downstairs complaining". This began the retaliation - my assigned parking spot is located far from my unit and every time I was walking back to my door they would sit on their balcony calling me vulgar things and spitting and pouring drinks over the balcony as I walked by. I reported this to no reaction from management as well. 

 I later found out the unit above was housing 5 people although only 1 was on the lease - meaning no other adult had been background checked  for a criminal history. As a woman living alone I became more concerned. I pushed harder for them to take action and in turn manager Pam offered to "let" me break my lease at no charge - she tried to push me out instead of dealing with the real issue. I pointed out that is MEB wanted to break the lease they would be legally obligated to abide by their terms just the same and that they wouldn't be doing ME the favor by trying to force me to leave and pay to try and move again. She relented and 5 months later the neighbors above me finally movedBEWARE!!  Don't park your car here while traveling.
We returned from 10 trip. Loaded car and started engine. Loud exhaust noise. Car catalyst vandalized (cut out) in parking lot that supposedly has security. The only security person we saw was on the day we returned and he was hanging out in the lobby. Hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times. General manager provided me with their insurance info as a way to get me out of the lobby knowing that their insurance company was not going to cover vandalism damage to our car. $2200.00 later, car is fixed. Situation was handled very poorly by Hampton Inn management.Someone please put this theatre out of its misery!  It was good in the 1970s but not anymore. Cramped seating, minimal leg room, and not many restrooms. YukThis location is CLOSED.Well, I broke away from my norm which is the lunch lounge across the street in the 501 building to see if I could get a little change, don't get me wrong, the lunch lounge ROCKS! five stars!!! but I wanted to venture out & heard about this place from some co-workers. After waiting 15min to order???? another 15min for my food & Oh BTW having to repeat my order to the girl, I finally got my ham sandwich. The bread was stale & chewy, this was on a Monday and I'm assuming made with old bread left over from the Friday or week before, the ham tasted so processed, and cut a lot thicker than I'm use to? My chips were passed their best eaten by date and the staff just seemed real quite and not so upbeat? I'm going to save my money, walk back across the street and go back to the lunch lounge! their line may be longer for good reason, but I've never waited more than 3 or 4min to place my order, and never more than 10min to get my food. True it takes a couple more minutes to walk across the street, but the Food & service offsets the time, and the staff makes up for that with their fresh, friendly, upbeat attitude! So take it from a true professional foodie, save your money, take the trip across the street, and enjoy some real fresh, home made delights!I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:

1. My car was broken into! This is a "gated" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time!
2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail!
3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt.

I'd say stay away from this place!!When we called the Motel before we arrived, they said they had plenty of rooms available, but when we got there the manager spent about 10 minutes searching for a room for us (said several were in the middle of some maintenance.  As we went to our room, we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all (the drapes were open and rooms were dark.)  This was the same story and situation the past 3 times we stayed here.  I think they just close rooms off, period.

Found a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something I won't even hazard a guess about. There is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized.  We will absolutely not be back here again.Honey Bears is a place I'd heard fantastic things about for quite some time and so when I finally made it over there one weeknight with some friends and office-mates, I was surprised to find it so incredibly lackluster. 

More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.

The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.

The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled. I've heard so many great things from people I trust, so I may have to try it once more, during the day, but for now, the one star stands, as there was simply nothing even a little redeeming about this food.Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. 
I had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place.Ew. Each bite was pure fatty nastiness.Let's be honest, when it comes to BBQ places that are decent, the valley is sorely lacking.  So, when I brought up the fact that I was having a serious itch for some Q, a coworker brought Honey Bear's up. Having not heard of it, I was in for it.

The establishment is a hole in the wall, butsome of the best BBQ I have ever had was in holes in the wall (i.e. Aurthur Bryant's in Kansas City). We got out of the car and were greeted by the pleasant smell of wood smoking meat, and it smelled awesome. I was super excited...until we stepped into the door.

The aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage. I kid you not it smelled like someone emptied their bowels in the middle of the lobby. People would come in and turn right back around and leave. But, my friend assured me this was the place to be so darn it, I was going to stick it out.

I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. The sauce had very little flavor to it but the meat was tender (there is your one star, the ability to not dry out chicken). I asked about what side the cashier would prefer and she just shrugged and said "I guess the potato salad." As expected from the response, it was mediocre.

But that smell went back with me to the office where a coworker asked if I had been sitting in an alley with a drunk during lunch. I had to change my shirt but the smell was burned into my nostrils.

Never again...NEVER...AGAIN.So theres a lot I'd like to cover or warn people about so I'll keep the keep points separated by paragraphs. 

So we've lived here for the better part of a year now and since day one we have seen these little yellow roaches everywhere that seemed to come out at night, they were EVERYWHERE! We don't have much food in the house and its all kept in the fridge to keep it from all the bugs. They come from the unsealed cabinets and every drain in the house. I even see them in the dishwasher climbing all over the dishes all the time. Dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them. I don't know how many times I woken up to bugs crawling around, flicked them off my newborn son or woken up to them in my shirt.  We literally kill anywhere from 15-40 roaches in a single night every single night. When we go to the office they always off put it onto other people and though we see the spray truck here regularly but never visiting out unit, only those near the office.The last 5 months or so seem to have brought some new beetle things to the apartment. Twice I've moved stacks of papers for work and tons of baby beetles fleeing from them. And for the record we are immaculate in our place. Theres never a mess or uncleaned surface. 

The grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area. The gates here have worked for more than a week at most at one time. They actually haven't closed in months, last time they were fixed it was for just part of the day.  The garbage piles up around all the garbage cans for days. You will find bags lying everywhere including taking up car spaces which are not always easy to come by. 

The water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning. Its happened a few times during our stay here but the last time the grounds were flooded so I could see it wasn't planned. 

The air conditioning unit in here drips a lot and my family and I have had bad respiratory issues the last 6 months and come to find out the AC was pumping out mold spores that we were breathing for months. The thing hadn't even had the air filter in it all this time either. All those times we thought it was severe allergies or that we stayed awake all night coughing was poor building maintenance. My infant son often gets fevers of up to 104 that seem to spike when all of our symptoms get going. Needless to say we are breaking our lease and moving. I will not pay a company to let me rent a bug infested mold box that jeopardizes the health of my family. 

Your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn. They invite parties of several people to the pool and blast music all day (and night) long. Screaming kids at the pool after midnight got old real quick. I very regularly see children under the age of I'm guessing 12 at the pool unsupervised with no adults to be found.Gotta love when you call the office to ask a question and they act like your interrupting their day! Glad we moved out!Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. 

OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. 

Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... "maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see" we said to each other ... 

On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - "pigs stomach with jalapeno", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. 

We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience.Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.  

Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.  

After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.

Another big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!

Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.

Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called "bait and switch" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?What are you in the mood for?  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind.

Pros:  All you can eat

Cons:  Why in the world would you want more than a bite?????
Every different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens.  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh, the romaine was not, the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine, the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting, the bacon bits contained no trace of pig, and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found.  

While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos? package might be worth $7 and change, this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein.  When your name contains the word "salad," don't you think you should offer some good greens?The server was over the top obnoxious.   He insisted on having our names just to take our order.  He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.  He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.  

The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee's rules and regulations.  Let me tell you, there are a lot of them. The manager's list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with "I can't" or  "You can't".  The manager made me hate this place even more.We were in the mood for wings and their half price reverse happy hour. Everyone was nice, the food was good, we shared the regular boneless wings, barbecue boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks. 

However.

About a half hour, maybe an hour at most, both of us were horribly sick. All last night, and now today too. My girlfriend had to leave work she's so sick (I told her not to go into work with food poisoning...) It was probably the chicken wings. At least its friday now so we can be sick at home and not worry about working.One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch.My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints.DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.

Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?

FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.

Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.

--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;
--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;
--special "top shelf" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;
--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;
--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.
--chicken "guisado" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;
--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;
--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!

After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH.Unless you have a few hours of your life you don't mind wasting, DO NOT COME HERE! 

My wife and a few friends decided to grab some happy hour food and beverages somewhere. when we arrived and sat down we asked about specials, the waiter replys with "oh,  um.... $3 draft and wells". we proceed to ask about food and margarita specials (that the sign behind us clearly states). he tells us "no". I then ask him "Are you Sure? Because that sign over there says differently". He then says "i'll check". 

I was right. 

strike 1..

After we order a drink we decided on some food. About 
15 minutes after we order a group of about 12 or 13 business type people walked in......Well i'm not really sure what happen after this point but everything seemed to go down hill really fast. 

Ok..... so i then ask the bartender to change the tv station from CBS News to the football game. (we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.

25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says "you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order. 

Finally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed "Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise! 

1. We ordered long before they even came in. 
2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!

They got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food. 

After comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) "Sure, No problem he says". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to "figure it out" 

 My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we "figure out" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone. 

At this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck. After 5 minutes and not even a" i'll be right with you" or anything i walked out without leaving a tip. i have never done that before. EVERInstead of a review, here is the letter I wrote AJs about my experience in their store. They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.

"I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. 

Anyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, "Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city". 

Sadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. 

This woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over "needy" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. 

Despite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity."My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.  

When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. 

I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!this is my first 1 star review


it used to be that i could place an internet order and instantly know that it would be correctly done to my specifications in the time that i requested it in.
Recently:  i don't know who the buffoon's are that the now "fedex kinko's"
hired, but the last three orders i put in not only sucked, it took
decades for these people to find and although i left my phone number in bold for them to call if there were any questions, they sent me three emails instead of calling me
. 
whooo i ask you sits at their inbox waiting for a response from kinkos?
these people are idiots.
i will be going to the washington one from now on.I went here and I told the guy this is my first time I ever been in a cigar shop and I asked whats the difference between these two cigars? He responded with "if you need to ask you dont need to be here"  then it was just silent and I walked out and now I just go right down the street to cigar ware house on 10thst and camelback.Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.The carpet is completely unsanitary and a breeding ground for MRSA. The instructor only verbally ran the class, never demonstrated one pose OR even made rounds to correct those doing them wrong. Lots of people that hadn't done yoga before because of the groupon and it's unfortunate they have been thought incorrectly. This instruction method is going to cause people injuries. FYI never do a jerking twisting motion with your upper body to try and square your hips!!! The instructor even told me and another girl NOT to drink water at the moment we did! So not OK, always listen to your bodies needs.Never Again,
I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in.I just left this Walgreens where the pharmacist on duty discriminated against me and publicly humiliated me. 

This is what happened. I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with "regular" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.

However:

I badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.

So he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.

I was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.

So I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.

What I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.

However, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.

But if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.

Not at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.

Upon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, "I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV."

From the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said "from the DMV." 

I said: "That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me."

She then arrogantly proclaimed: "I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!"

I protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.

Upon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, "Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!"

Okay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. 

I'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.

She actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.

So, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, "Okay. I agree." (clenching my teeth in agony)

As I was walking out, I turned to her and said, "I am now going to write a review online."

She replied: "Good! Go ahead. And now we will never serve you again." She went over to the computer and publicly announced that she will make a note on my account and that I can't get prescriptions from there anymore. Again, humiliating me in public.

And what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I did nothing wrong. I never even swore or called her a bad name. All on videotape.

I am contacting an attorney first thing Monday morning. Good luck Walgreens.Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..

Veterans DESERVE better than this!!Horrible. Been in the emergency waiting room for over 6 hours to be seen for difficulty breathing and chest pains. It's so frustrating.Update....711pm and still sitting I the same chair.

Update two.....850pm. Just got called back!!!!! Yes.....but wait. Just to wait in another waiting room inside the ER.

Final update, left at 1130pm without any test results.  They said I can wait 3 more hours or they can call me later.  

I chose to leave and they called me at 3am to give me my results.I Hesitated to write this review on the Phoenix VA Hospital, but it should be said.  Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.  They need a 2nd hospital for one thing and a lot more staff.waited 20 min. for a booth, then 15 min after seated to get iced tea and water. Walked out after 20 more min and no sign of server or salads....I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est.. Well, to cut this short; I am a spicy fave type of guy. I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken.  Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing, this est. upset me and I threw it, what they tried to feed me, in the trash. THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Even if they dared try to redeem what happened.I've been here two different times, Once for a haircut and shave, another time for a "trim". The first time the haircut was great, however after the straight shave my neck bled for days on end and looked like I had been mauled by a bear. You would have thought that was warning enough to stay away but after a few months I decided to go get a neck trim. Bad Idea. Apparently when you tell someone your growing your hair out and to leave the top and sides alone, In Russian it mean to cut EVERYTHING and leave it a little longer than normal. Then when you do ask for it to be fixed they talk crap about you in Russian. Bad Business. I should have spend the extra time and gas driving to my regular barber at 19th and greenway.Was next door waiting for my girlfriends doctor appointment when I got hungry so I walked over to this place. Says doors open at 10:30 so I checked my phone and surprisingly it was exactly 10:30, so I reached for the door and it was locked. I decided to wait 5 minutes in the chair outside and watched an employee walk in and lock the door behind him so I left. Needless to say if your establishment opens at 10:30 then be prepared to open at 10:30. They lost my lunch business for today.The Dem party in Arizona is truly wonderful. They push issues that need to be pushed and stand behind their arguments, which by the way, always make sense.

These people are doing a fine job running our state and should be lauded as genuine people, willing to do the right thing.Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.

Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. 

But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.

While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. 

So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.

"Awwww, man, now you've locked us out," we say, playfully.

The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with "Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out" before walking off with his cigarette.

"What the hell just happened?" I ask.
"He thinks we're a straight couple." 
I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.

I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. 

I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.

I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.

Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointedI should listen to the warning signals that go off in my head when I enter an establishment that proudly displays a sign which reads:  "YOU WANT IT WHEN?", depicting a bunch of cartoon people rolling around on the floor laughing. That speaks VOLUMES about what kind of customer service is to be expected. This is the WORST dry cleaner I have ever gone to, bar none. Three times now I have paid top dollar to have Betsey Johnson dresses cleaned, only to have them returned looking exactly the same as when I dropped them off. Before last week, the last dress I had brought in (which cost me $12.00 on eBay, and that included shipping) cost me $22.00, $11.00 for the dress itself, & $11.00 for the polyester under-slip. There was a spot on the dress when I brought it in which was still there when I picked it up, however, since there was no notification that the spot couldn't be removed, I thought I was going home with a clean dress--as was the case with both other dresses. Btw, DANA argued with me and implied that I am a liar because I said that none of the three items had a tag on them indicating there was a spot that couldn't be removed. Because I had already had two experiences in the past with spots that weren't spot-cleaned, I decided to try hand washing the third dress before donating it to Goodwill...lo & behold, the spot came out. Customers get sick of going back, wasting PRECIOUS time & more money to get things done right, which was why I decided not to bring that particular dress back in. Last week I decided to give them one more chance, so I brought in three dresses to be pressed & one sleeveless gauze top. One of the dresses has layers, but I was not advised when I dropped it off that pressing it would cost $17.00. The other two dresses evidently cost $11.00 apiece to press, & the gauze top about $7.00. At that time, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED for the price to press long dresses, & the clerk, Mayra, told me it would cost about a dollar less than the dry cleaning process. She did not mention A THING about the layered dress costing $6.00 more...evidently I was supposed to intuitively know that the question needed to be asked. In other words, A LIE BY OMISSION. So I spent around $46.00 for the pressing of three dresses & the dry cleaning of one cotton top. I had asked for an $11.00 discount on the current order based on the fact that they didn't do the job right on the last dress I had brought in, & the owner, DANA (DANA wanted me to be sure to mention DANA's name here...happy to oblige!) started shaking and hyperventilating because I told DANA I thought a discount was in order for the inconvenience, as well as the spot that was still present on the last dress after I got it home...which cost me $11.00. I don't think even wealthy people--which I am not--feel they have money like that to blow. I asked DANA what was WRONG with DANA, treating a customer this way, & DANA's response was that DANA is the owner & that DANA can treat me however DANA likes. Man, do I pity DANA's employees. I wasn't asking for an additional $11.00 refund for the extra charge to clean a SLIP. Anyway, evidently DANA would rather make herself sick than be kind/accommodating to a customer. In the two years I was their customer, I had asked twice to have spots re-cleaned, NOT FOR REFUNDS OR CREDITS, yet today DANA basically told me I am a malcontent because I don't like to spend tons of money for nothing. And then DANA said I complained EVERY TIME I picked something up...so DANA is a LIAR, too. Believe me, if I had had that many complaints prior to today, I would have stopped bringing my clothes there a long time ago...today's experience was the FOURTH strike, which is more chances than I give most people who take my money, do a substandard job & then try to blame me instead of doing the right thing by admitting they made a mistake. SPARE ME. And yes, I consider the way DANA treated me--& the job FASHION CLEANERS did--a form of r@pe, because unless I paid their price, I was powerless to get back what is mine (which didn't bother me so much until I paid them $22.00 FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING). DANA's complete lack of customer service--& outright RUDENESS to a customer who, in the past, had referred OTHER people to spend their money at Fashion Cleaners--ensured that I won't go back. DANA actually accused ME of being defensive!!!! The girl who waited on me, Mayra, admitted when I left that I had always been very kind in the past, until DANA had a total meltdown today--obviously DANA doesn't know HOW to take criticism. My advice to DANA:  If DANA can't stand the heat, DANA should get shrunk and out of the freakin' kitchen. DANA does not belong in a customer-service oriented profession. PATHETIC. Three strikes, and I gave them the GIFT of another. YOU'RE OUT! ADDENDUM: THE ELASTIC SMOCKING ON TWO BRAND NEW DRESSES WAS COMPROMISED (PERMANENTLY STRETCHED OUT IN SOME PLACES) BY WHATEVER METHOD THEY USED TO "PRESS" MY DRESSES. BBB, HERE I COME!You have got to be kidding me...absolutely unable to eat any of the four dishes ordered for lunch today. I read the below reviews and wondered if I was in the same place...mumbles the waiter couldn't have been less help if he had stayed home today.
The broth was flavorless, the noodles like a pile of jelly. The fried pork was so over cooked I couldn't chew it. The cold noodles were indeed cold, as they tasted like they were cooked 3 days ago and stored in the fridge. And the miso soup? Me so wished it was good, as I was starving when I left.Mexican pizza was extremely gross. Made me sick. Tasted like it was old and reheated 10 or 15 times before I got it. Lady at front gave a a dirty look when I asked for something else. Just keep on driving.Mexican pizza tasted like chemicals. The beef in the burritos were awful tasting. Pretty much everything we ordered was terrible. Don't even stop here.SERVICE SCAM ALERT!

I went to have my car serviced from a light that came on.  The next day they called me to tell me the problem and added that my oil pan and radiator where leaking badly and that I needed to replace my Radiator and pull the oil pan to replace the gasket at a cost of near $2,000 total.  What I found odd was that my 7 year old car had not dropped anything in my driveway or garage.

I decided to not have the work done by them and took it to another garage to have looked at.  They told me both where fine and that I had been lied to.

Since I have kept a drip pan under my car and after months, still not a single drop of oil or radiator fluid.  While it is there, I had them change a belt which clearly was not done as this is NOT a new belt.

I will never go back under any circumstances.Says it's Kosher, but apparently only sometimes.   I Googled "kosher bakery phoenix" and Karsh's popped up. So I made the visit to the shop, preparing to find something suitable for passover. I arrived and was met at the door by the sign, "Sorry. Our products are not suitable for passover. Everything is made with flour, bla bla bla" I'm paraphrasing. So I went inside, wondering if it was an April Fool's joke. Although the store was COMPLETELY empty, I mean, barren of all lifeforms, the surly girl behind the counter took her time asking if she could help me. Our exchange proved that it was no joke. They could not help me. No yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future. They were kosher - just not for Passover. Lovely. I should've Googled "kosher bakery Scottsdale."My gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a Sat. This place sucks! The bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol. Wont return again. It also smells like cigarette smoke from before they banned smoking in the bars. Gross! better dive bars to be hadMaybe I am the most "uncool" person on Yelp, but I HATED this place.  A friend and I decided to meet here thinking it sounded like a chill place to have a drink, relax, go down memory lane, etc.

We drove separately and I arrived before him.  I paid a $10 cover to get inside, only to discover that "inside" was so dark I could not see, so packed I could not move, and playing the most INSANELY loud I-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it music I have ever heard.

Trying not to be a diva, I went to the bar and ordered a Jack on the rocks.  It took me screaming at the bartender to accomplish this feat, likely through no fault of his own.

Anyway, my buddy showed up and miraculously recognized my silhouette in the dark.  (I am a perfectly normal size 10/12 so I didn't stand out at all.)  

He ordered a drink and we stood in awkward, pitch-black, booming silence until we decided to just slam our drinks and leave.

That was the most interesting $15+ dollar Jack (including cover) I have ever had.

I don't see the appeal.  Maybe on a weekday?Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.Went by this place last week and it is now closed down..

Looked like they are preparing to raze the building.Let me explain the 1 star ....

I've been to Scott's a few times before ... LOVED IT! I've sat outside, ordered to go but never have I sat inside until last week.

Was visiting with friends and we got a booth, placed our orders ... started to chit-chat and out of the corner of my eye, I see something on the wall. No! Couldn't be! Why yes, it was your friendly neighborhood roach! And he brought a friend! We gals stopped talking midstream, looking around to see if anyone else saw what we did. Why yes!! our server saw the two unwelcome guests as she was standing at the food delivery window. Guess what she did??! Nothing. Until we pointed them out and rapidly moved to another table.

Honestly, we all were wigged out. Talk about an appetite lost! Too bad. I had totally enjoyed Scott's up until then. 

Most likely will not be back.So, the way I figure it, a 24/7 gas station/deli should be open, hmmmmmm, let me think, 24/7?  I'll give you Christmas; they could reasonably closed on Christmas.  Not New Years, people are hung over or just getting out of jail/back from Vegas, so, open New Years.   But yesterday?  


                              April 21, 2013, CLOSED!  9:54pm, CLOSED.  NOT OPEN

Oh well.

NOTE TO OWNER OF MARYLAND DELI AND LIQUOR, AKA: 7TH STREET SHELL STATION: BAD BUSINESS, PAL.  BAD BUSINESS.  I'LL NEVER COME BACK TO OVERSPEND ON EVERYTHING, (which if they are open, it's a convenience I'll pay for) TO NOW FIND YOU CLOSED!~  The only reason I've paid your prices in the past is because you were a good last resort.  Now you're just "last".

Note to self: never go here again.  Tell 100 friends to never go here again, how they just "take off" on a Sunday night.  That's called word-of-mouth, pal, and you or your "gone fishin' " staff just earned some muy, muy mal word-of-mouth.Never again. A few years back I was treated with horrible service. We approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too. Boycotted this bar for 2 years and tried it again. once again they prove to be a-holes. There are plenty of Friendly bars that will appreciate the business.This place use to be nice to eat at.  Now it's a dive!  The restaurant is filthy, I got a water glass with Lipstick on it and our coffee cups had dried cranberry juice on it.

I've been there multiple times thinking "it's just an off day",  The last time I went there was a week ago when a friend was visiting from Palm Springs and I have to say, I was embarrassed after taking him there!  They got his order wrong, our dishes were dirty and the waitress seemed annoyed that we even mentioned it.

I will never go there again.Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste? Keep that memory and don't go again.I was very nervous about going to my appoinment- I'm new to therapy. I had an evening appointment and the front office was closed when I got there, so I started filling out my new patient paperwork just as a sign had instructed. There was a bell to ring for service but no one came when I rang it (three times over 40 minutes). As people (I assume they were other therapists) came out of offices, no one acknowledged me or returned my smile. I finally got someone to take my paperwork and continued to wait. 

I got into my appointment about 15 minutes late. That happens and I don't fault anyone for that, but my appointment was also cut short. My therapist was disinterested in the entire shortened session. I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.

After I left, I jokingly told someone that the therapy session helped in its own way because the woman I saw was so curt and unpleasant that it made me feel like a better person.this bank is terrible and will charge you unfounded fees. it is a hassle to try and communicate with this bank and their customer service is terrible, i would not recommend this bank unless it is for someone you don't like and would like them to become financial screwed.I started shopping at Buffalo Exchange over 30 years ago, and their offerings have gotten worse over time.  They used to have an outstanding selection of vintage clothing, and now it seems there is a lot of newer JUNK.  I have been completely unsuccessful when it comes to selling, so I don't even try anymore because I get insulted when I am offered $6 for a $200 item, and do not understand their reasoning for why they don't think most of my things will sell--yet, there is an amazing amount of REALLY UGLY STUFF on the racks.  I think the salespeople and "buyers" are very ignorant about fashion.  All one has to do is look at how they dress...like bag people.

TELL YOUR CONDESCENDING MANAGER TO WASH HIS HAIR AND TAKE A SHOWER.  Just because you are promoting the alternative lifestyle, doesn't mean customers won't be offended by filthy, uncombed hair and such a slovenly presentation. GROSS!!! 

FINALLY GIVING UP ON THIS JOKE OF A PLACE :POk, don't get me wrong I have found some unique stuff here, but that was years ago. Now I feel like I'm shopping at a target outlet with awful customer service. Half of the clothes there were shirts from target, and they were maybe 2 dollars cheaper than they were new, which is a bummer when you go in looking for something fun and creative and unique for a good price. 

On another note, the customer service just plain sucked. I don't go in expecting much, but for them to be rude is just such a turn off from the store. I want to love this store, but lately it just seems like a joke. I won't be giving them my business anymore.Looks like a great store, with reasonable prices - I wanted to get a bouquet primarily based on snapdragons.  I priced out what would be reasonable based on the listed prices, and was told that they have a 2.50 fee PER FLOWER to arrange (meaning take out of the container and wrap in paper) - more than doubling the cost.  I was ready to spend 90 bucks for 2 simple bouquets.  

I have never experienced a flower shop do this.  Most of the time, I walk into a shop, state what I'd like and a price range l, and they would pick and choose for me, making a beautiful paper wrapped bouquet - and charge the per flower price listed.  The guy at this shop simply said "not going to happen" and walked away.  At least he could have been nicer.

Such a shame, it seemed to get good reviews, and is conveniently located.

*** turns out the picture I put up was of the wrong guy.  Trying to remove!Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli.I don't know if their food is good and frankly, I don't care. All I know is that I have NEVER in my life been so appalled at the horrible level of customer service at this location and I'll never go back. I called in my order one night and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later) my order wasn't ready. I waited an extra 15 minutes before asking how long it would be. When the cashier turned around to find our how much longer, the ex-con looking a*hole of a fry cook in the back shouted some obscenities at me, called me a liar about how long I had been waiting, and that was pretty much all I needed to hear before demanding a refund and walking out the door. Long Wong's can suck a fatty; personally I wish that nasty eyesore had stayed closed.This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall, shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside.  OMG, hoarder heaven.
The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table.  I actually liked the hamburger.  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order.  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that.
It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce.Don't waste your money here. They love to find any reason to charge you extra fees. The front office is rude and doesn't ever return your phone calls or do what you ask them to do. They turn off the heat during summer months and turn off the AC in October even though its still in the 100s out. They had NO heat or AC almost the entire month of November and we still had to pay full rent. That is ILLEGAL. It was 105 and I had no AC, then it got down to 40 degrees at night and there was no heat so I had to keep my oven on to stay warm. I complained to the office and they just made up excuses to why they couldnt turn it on for a month. I was constantly having problems with losing hot water and water pressure. Ive had to call security there because neighbors were outside night after night fighting and hitting each ither and seciurity refused to come because they "dont deal with violence". are you kidding me?? whats the point of security?  I've never had such aggravations living at a place. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone. Worst experience ever.The owner is a total jerk0ff.  I have been in there so many times.  Each time he never comes by to ask how my meal was, yet he goes to other tables.  I am always in a suit so maybe he just doesnt like well dressed people (if you have seen the decor inside, you know what I mean).  It's dingy.  The food is ok---but the owner being a tool and not asking how everything was even once in 8 recent trips made me decide I will never come back ever. he is an idiot.Ok, first time I was here was for lunch. I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had. Noticed the pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place. 

two days later, for dinner and drinks, 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night. She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.

I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week. (joking.... kinda)I'm Sorry to say..But this store is just Nasty!!My wife and I have enjoyed lunch at Luke's just  about every Saturday since we met in 2008. She introduced me to Italian beef and is a native of Chicago. We first visited one of the two in Tucson and then alternated between the three -now one left--in the Phoenix area. We normally split an Italian beef; extra beef, cheese, sweet peppers, dipped; two extra crispy fries and an order of their homemade, batter dipped, onion rings. The food is awesome and I've had many of the items on the menu. The down side is the service. Now, I don't need the staff to be all happy and smiley but politeness and customer oriented I do expect. The owner and employees seem to be bothered by customers coming in to order food. A son of the owner of the Phoenix area restaurant(s) ran a place in Chandler, it was very nice and consistently packed with a  steady flow of customers and pleasantries from the staff. Not sure why papa didn't want junior to succeed, especially when his old man and brother own the two in Tucson. Seems you would want this to keep going with the family and be proud of a the legacy.  Anyway the Chandler store was closed without a word to the steady customer they knew by name and order. Then the same thing happened to the Scottsdale location. Showed up one Saturday and the place is empty and up for lease.
 
So, for food the rating would get all 5 stars from me, but the service leaves a bad taste in my mouth - pun intended. Still we come back every other week and search frantically for a quality Italian beef elsewhere.Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!Maybe I caught this restaurant on a bad night, but my experience was terrible. Having no experience with Greek food, I expected my waiter to be knowledgeable and be able to speak English to recommend a dish. However, our server spoke broken English, was extremely touhcy feely and overly attentive. When we arrived there was not a soul to be found in this restaurant. When I asked what certain things were on the menu, I couldn't understand his responses and ended up randomly picking something. My meal was awful. I couldn't tell you what it was, but all I know is I will not be returning.I went into the Scottsdale location yesterday.  I was going to be seated right by the kitchen by the host when the restaurant was 20% full and then asked to be seated in another area where there were more people around and better lighting.  The waiter never cleared our plates, and I had to order 3 meals before I could even eat anything.  This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses, slow waiters, the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow...  I think this time I am calling the food inspector.  I am sure that there are many violations happening in this restaurant.  I tried to give them feedback, however, they  did not recieve it well.

Please don't waste your money.  This is such a poor example of no service and bad food.  I expected to get food poisoning after this experience.If you are looking for tasteless Mexican this is your place.  Besides no flavor, the dishes don't come with any garnishes such as sour cream or guacamole. I had a chicken tostada except there was barely any chicken and was about five inches in diameter. My husband had a Chile Relleno and Two Tostittos plus a coke. No rice or beans and our bill was $28!Customer service here is terrible.  Guy working there wouldn't accept my tv even though it was under warranty.  Finally had to call a manager at a DIFFERENT Best Buy location (Scottsdale) where they told me they would gladly fix my tv for free.  Not worth the hassle to go here.Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck.Shady pricing!!! I took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $17.00 for a fade. The price chart say that children under 13 are $14.00. When I questioned the inaccurate fee I was told that it's an extra $3.00 to get "lined up" which wasn't even given to us as an option nor was it on the price chart. We will never go back and we will continue to spread the word about their shady prices and hidden fees.I don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here, except for maybe the wine.  I thought the sandwiches were just so so, unmemorable.
the tea as well.The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too!I used to eat here all the time. It's been a hot minute. Today having lunch at their once great lunch buffet was horrid. The rice was dry and crunchy. The food was of poor quality. The tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky . On top of all that the services was horrid. I had to actually get up from the table and walk over to the bar were there was 5 waiters standing around and talking to ask for a refill of soda. They acted like it was such a bother and barely said two words to us. Never going back againBeing an Indian i would definitely know what Indian food should taste like, and this one is no way near to the original, Young guy is the son of the actual owner (who is nice guy) is extremely ill-behaved,  gravy we ordered was full of water and tasted like crap. First learn to talk decently with your own country men, later comes serving good  food.Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!I stopped by this bar because a friend knows the owner. The patrons were nice and the bar tender was fantastic. I gave it one star because the owner  (little dude) and his wife (drunk with an attitude) really don't care about their patrons. Not a good experience for non-locals and I would not suggest this bar.If your interested in bull dogs and favoritism,  you've found your home.  Beware of undercover trolls posing as owners protecting his Bitches. More balls here than the Phoenix Mercury basketball team apparently. Not lbgt friendly.  Perhaps a new location outside of the parralegram is timeI have been several times just because it is convenient. Last time, I had two shirts stolen out of my backseat. I went in and told the manager. He acted like I was making it up. I paid to have my car detailed and spent almost $80.00, and it looked like I got the basic wash. They didn't even get all of the tar (my main reason for detailing) off of the guards. I will never go back. I would rather do it myself than be so mad that I wasted the money everytime I go to Danny's. Ok, the owner must be a complete idiot. He will have the guys for immigration in soon asking for green cards. Talk about a "run for the border". Taco Bell.No shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for Danny's. I wish I would have read them before I took my car in. Why you ask? Here goes:

They stole my change (probably over 15 bucks).
Exterior was dripping with water and back was streaked with mud.
They wrote on the car window, "basic wash" and it did not come off after the wash.
If they vacuumed the interior I couldn't tell, I can tell you they didn't vacuum the floor mats, or the driver's side.
They didn't wipe down the interior; there was still dust exactly where I left it.

Normally I would have back to complain, but after waiting over an hour I just wanted to get F out of there. Danny's should take some lessons from Los Olivos, they do a proper car wash.

1 Star is generous.Uhh should have listened to yelpers! My roommate said this place was good so I went this morning and now, I'm regretting it. My car is still dirty but now I have messed up tint on my back window! I have no idea how they managed to mess up factory tint but now every time I look out my review mirror it's a reminder of how terrible this place is. When I brought this to there attention a guy with gold teeth pretended like he all of a sudden didn't speak english! I didn't have the time to try and speak with anyone else but, if I ever go back it will be to complain. The car is dirty and I'm sad. Don't do it!Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!Bottom line, Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is NOT worth your business... Save your time and money! Your car will not properly be tended to and the staff, especially the Management (Oscar and Martin) couldn't be anymore unprofessional or empathetic. If you care about actually having your car washed, this is NOT the place to go. I have been a faithful customer to this specific location for 3 years since moving into the Biltmore. I used to get my gas, oil-changes and vehicles washed here, but time and time again (chance after chance), my car was left to air dry, rims never cleaned or towel dried, forgotten about the air freshener, etc. I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off. It is clearly the most unorganized group of employees I have every witnessed at a car wash facility. I'm a reasonable guy, but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay. An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office, that I ended up leaving 3 messages for, requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention. A week later, I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls. A week after that call, a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man, (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore. I was appalled and tad confused... Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences. I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call. This is a lot to read, but if it helps you to make a more informed decision and avoid some serious frustration, let alone having to get your car re-washed, then great! If anyone would like photos (clearly showing the facility, my vehicle,  and its neglect, please let me know). I also have a video showing a Mercedes that was hand washed after mine (the guys spent an extra 3 minutes and 23 seconds on a vehicle twice as small as mine.)  Regards, Chad B.After being raided several times by Arpaio's posse, apparently Arpaio started hooking them up with tent city work furlough workers. 

I made a huge mistake of getting my oil changed there. Halfway into the change I asked them if they replace the oil filter (I shouldn't have assumed), he said no, but he JUST MIGHT have a matching oil filter that he could install for $30 bucks. What? He then tries to upsell me on an air filter, saying oil filter and air filter costs $150, but for me he'd do it for $100. I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.

Avoid this place like the plague.I've been going to Danny's for years. I would take one car, fill it up, get the Works wash and go back for the 2nd car, at least weekly. Have always been pleased with the finished product and thought it was a good value. The employees were top-notch; Friendly, efficient, had a passion for their jobs. 
In the last 6-9 months there has been a dramatic change...zombies for employees, the service is very slow, crappy job on the cars. 
Sorry Danny, you have lost a loyal, formerly happy customer. 
Now I need to find a new place!I'm so sad. this use to be my favorite car wash. Now it is like walking through a prison yard. The people that work there is why I will not be going back. it use to be the best , with the best car wash and service. I wish Sheriff Joe didn't get rid of all their employees and Danny obviously made a deal with Joe on hiring convicts for a tax break. I had scary men hitting on me while I walked in (that work there) and I mind tattoo people but wow. I also don't think my car was clean when I left. I will not be going back , after 10 years. Danny !! come on.I went in a few weeks ago. I reached into the car when they were done and the cash in my ashtray had been stolen. This is funny only because I was going to give it to them anyway. When I told the Manager, he told me that it had been happening recently and that he would look into it. I never heard anything back. 

I went in again today and when I didn't tip as quickly as they had liked, the staff told me how rude I was for not tipping. 

Car wash is is mediocre on  a good day, but convenient location for me. Too bad the management can't manage the staff. It is a case of the inmates running the prison, if you know what I mean.dee-skusting!  ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.

try it if you don't believe.

don't tell me i didn't warn you

save your hard earned cash for another place and timeyou couldn't pay me to set foot in this shady place... I tried it a couple of times in 2011 and 2012 and I was surprised that a place like this was still in business, especially given its prime location.  

Service was horrible, we were treated like trespassers by the thug behind the bar.

consider yourself warned.BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible.Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well.DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  We got seriously scammed on our gift card and management has done nothing about it.  They don't care that their customers are  being ripped off because they already got their money.  I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office against Richardson's/Rokerij.Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!).last ditch Christmas eve take home pizza...ok...I ordered it on line and went and picked it up..they kept me waiting anyway...I asked for extra crisp...might as well have asked for extra raw...just to much dough..ingredients just laid on top of mushy dough...flavors..so so...would never go there again thanks....I was in the Phoenix area for baseball spring training and was looking for a unique restarant experience.  As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  

My friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.

Across the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit "fishy", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.

I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.  If you do dine here, stick to the spaghetti or maccaroni with cheese, and do not order the spaghetti neri!We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our "go to" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes.My husband and I found it one Open kitchen. We read the reviews and decided to try it out. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door. The hostess asked us if we wanted the formal dining area or lounge. We chose the lounge. She asked if we wanted a wine list. We said yes. Bread was brought over and that wS the last we saw of anyone for 20 minutes. Finally, I said lets go. My husband went to find the hostess and I guess a manager came and asked if we have been helped. I said no, and he brought someone over. The waiter didn't seem to thrilled to serve us. He had trouble remembering the specials. Not impressed with the service, staff, or food. Won't be going back.Terrible Nasty Trashy PlaceThis store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the "only one who could help me." When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. 
A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.
However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.

Yes, mold.

Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.

Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.

*ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix. 

What is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!

I would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try..Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too.

My food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.

Because I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.

I am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there.

Both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit.This place is horrible.  The sandwhich/paninis can be summarized as follows.  They take some french bread, put maybe a slice of meat or two on it, but no more, and toast it.  They have absolutely no meat on them.  You will leave hungry, along with lunch taking a bite out of your pocket book.  Pricey and bad service.  I have eaten here 3 times, as I used to work in the vicinity, and every time I had absolutely horrible service.  I always have to get up and ask for napkins, refills, silverware, whatever it may be.  Also, there pastry selection is always inconsistent.  I have also had several of their muffins.  They are ok, but not anything special.

I would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back.Pros: Easy to find, reasonable prices, close to my home, always has available parking

Cons: I used to come here because it was the closest to my home. I just had to stop. They messed up my clothes 30% of the time, but I still kept coming. However, they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants I brought in one time. When I tried to bring it to their attention, they argued that it was the way I washed the pants. I had not even worn the pants or washed them.Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  The service was slow and disrespectful and I'm not sure I would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this "steakhouse" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. Don't do it, try City Hall.After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.A "Cypriot" grill that excludes halloumi from the menu cannot be run by Cypriots..!! I was very sadly disappointed. This establishment would be short-lived in Cyprus.I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night. I went in to find a nice dress to wear. After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything, I asked the clerk where it was. Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16.
Talk about being disappointed. I was so upset I almost cried. 
Shame on you...... You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore...I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.

This was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. 

My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. 

The server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)

By the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!

I walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back.Is it possible to give "zero" stars?

I've been in there twice and the employees were rude, both times.  I'm not the "Scottsdale Elite", but seriously... I'm a paying customer too.  The little boy who said he was the manager was rude too.This place really sucks I went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out. I mean I know working sucks, but come on it's your job. So I give this place one star for the staff being rude, and the fact that i had to go to the Ski Pro in Mesa to rent the clothes that fit me. In the end I wish I had rented everything from the Ski Pro in Mesa. Mesa Ski Pro is a lot more polite and will be more than willing to help you find what you need.Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  

My experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  

And patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  

After my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'

Enough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients.I hate coming here, the receptionist seems mad always, she has a rude tone and makes you feel like you are annoying her.  I only cone here cus I'm leaving in a couple months but lawd this place needs a new crew not to mention dr. Kramer can be a rude one! I can tell he got irritated when he knew I had to be refered out..... read riviews in the end we make him business and his staff gets paid because we the patients bring business.... hmmm maybe they should think about thisFirst time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time.I'm reluctant to write a negative review as I understand how hard it is to run a business, but the service I received today was abysmal. I have a group of friends that eat their regularly so I've seen this place go up and down with quality. 

The big issue is there's no attention to detail when the orders go back to the kitchen. They actually seem to have a tendency to do the exact opposite of what's requested. Don't get me wrong, when it's good it's good, but I've seen more food sent back to the kitchen at this restaurant than anywhere else. It's got to the point at times that I've seen the waiting staff actually argue with the cook.

When I arrived tonight my hopes were high, as the manager was actually here for the first time in months. She was aware that our group had complaints and actually came to talk to us about issues the kitchen of been having. After what seemed to be a constructive talk we placed our orders with the waitress with confidence. Well, needless to say my food was incorrect again. Not only was it wrong, it almost seemed intentionally incorrect. When I express my dismay the manager went and brought the cook out which made me very uncomfortable. 

At this point I was ready to cancel the order altogether, but they said they take the food back to correct it. What the manager brought to the table the second time was worse than the first. I wish I could say I couldn't believe it, but I've gotten quite used to this level of incompetence from this restaurant. I sent it back and told them to cancel the order altogether.

The only bright spot about this restaurant is the waiters and waitresses do seem to work hard, it's just the kitchen throws them under the bus with their incompetence and the management under staffs them so they always have too many tables.

I guess the only thing left for me to do is try and convince the 15 top that comes to eat there on a weekly basis that we need to start going to another restaurant, but my friends are a little stuck in their ways.

Ugh!!!Let me preface this review by saying two things: 1. if there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it and 2. I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real "slice of life" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My "over-easy" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail. Better service, better food quality (I am not joking) and it would have been $5.50 a person for the same meal. You fooled me once Linda. Shame on me. You won't be fooling me again!The place was pretty deserted...I discovered  why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority.

That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks.Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.

do not go there.I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable.Well... 

My mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? 

So mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) 

The great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. 

But really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. 

Just not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad...We took a client to Hillstone for dinner. The place is beautiful and the service was great. The food was slightly better than bar food, but certainly not worth the prices they are charging. If you are an advocate of fine dinning: you will be sorely disappointed.  

Go there for drinks, enjoy the gorgeous ambiance, but go somewhere else for a nice dinner.

I had the Cod special of the day, thirty minutes after eating my stomach started feeling queazy and at 5am I was woken by uncontrollable......food poison symptoms! There were four other members of our party and their stomachs were fine, but they were not overly impressed with their meals. Everyone did enjoy the atmosphere.It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. 

We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by "Al." Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked "Al" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, "We'll get you seated, no problem." After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed "Al" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked "Al" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? 

Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender "Christian" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by "Christian." We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame.I was terribly upset with this restaurant. Their prices are absurd for the casual dining experience which made their disinterest in pleasing their customers even more inexcusable. They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination.We mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's.   At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table.  (We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response.)  The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing.  
The honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years.  They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control (which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm).  No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again.   Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food.I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.

This is the wonderful help i've gotten.
Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.

The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. 

I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they "tried" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?

Then there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.

And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. 

And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. 

The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. 

I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang "Smells Like Athlete's Foot." Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.

This 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower. 

The rest of the gym has an "I love the 80's" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe. 

Worst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: "Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break." 

Ummm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym.Total lack of staffing you can walk all over this store and not find an employee. Its dirty, disorganized, and most the time you are left to having to use self checkout, the have virtually no carts or trollys. To top that off you get accosted by illegal immigrants as drive in to the parking lot and while leaving.The customer service including that of the manager Jeff at this Home Depot is the worst I've every received.  I was contacted to pick up a door that I had ordered.  After waiting for an hour, the staff including the manager running the store finally figured out that the someone had set the door up front in customer service (where the rep who called me said it would be) dahhh.  When I commented on how ignorant everyone was the manager started threatening me and I thought I was going to have to call the police.  I have written a letter to corporate about this store and manager.  If you must shop at Home Depot make sure it isn't this one unless you are experienced in Martial Arts.  It truly is the ghetto and the staff reflect it.This review is just about the paint department, only.  The workers in that department there are phenomenal but the lack of staffing in the paint department is ridiculous.  You can count on them to do their best,  but it is hard to deal with.  I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.  Whenever possible,  I have moved my purchases over to another specialty paint store only due to the lack of staffing at Home Depot on Thomas Road.This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back.My son likes to go there for poppers on the weekend.  His second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake.  This is the second weekend in a row that they have been out of both.   The first time, I thought it was a fluke.  Two weekends in a row is a trend.  If you run out of something daily, make more of it.  Obviously, there's now more of a demand for both of these.  You can make more of them to meet the demand or don't and demand will go down from people like me not coming back to your store.  Dunkin Doughnuts, here we come again!I went there last week for breakfast. I left with a burnt bagels and a watered down latte. The employees don't take any pride in their product. I sent my comments into corporate and they didn't reply. Overall no body cares. They've lost a customer. I would recommend either Starbucks which is across the street or Wildflower Bakery. I always get great service and good food at both locations.Called and specifically asked if they could guarantee delivery between specific times on Valentines Day, once assured I placed my order.  15hrs later I get a voicemail asking if I could move the delivery to today and if so they would throw in a box of chocolates free of charge.  After being put on hold for a total of 30min and hung up on twice they finally found my order and assured me that everything would be delivered today.  Well the flowers were delivered today but no chocolates along with misspelled  and misquoted words on the card.  When you charge $15 for delivery I'd expect some level of professionalism. I will NEVER order from here again.  STAY AWAY and order from 1-800-FLOWERS.  I had wanted to support a local business but in this instance I will stick with a national competitor.Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all.The  petco near me was out of my boys favorite off the rawhide bar so, I called this store and asked if they had a rawhide bar. Yes we do--  Hoped in the car to make the six mile drive

Excuse me?  Where is your rawhide bar?  Oh I'm sorry we font have that anymore.  There are a few on the endcap over there.

Really?  Excuse me, do you have a water bowl where my dog can get a drink?  Yes, in the back of the store by the restrooms.  Uh, theres no bowl back there.  Well, maybe thats because the water fountain is broke.  I will tell the mgr tomorrow. How does that help me now?

How much  did those rawhides weigh?  .93lbs.  Over on the other scale, it was less than .75.  Let me weigh it again--oops now its .95. Really?

Here's a review you can do over the phone to get a 2 dollar discount.

I REALLY DON'T think you want me to do a review and I wont be coming back anyway

Ok, have a great day, sirNever again!!!!  The worst customer service and communication I've ever experienced. They should all be fired and start fresh or I can guarantee this location will be gone in less than a year. HORRIBLE!!The WORST customer service experience I have ever had.
 They have no courtesy or manners what so ever.Literally one of the worst dining experiences ever. 

This restaurant is in our neighborhood and it looked so cute, I was very excited to get some breakfast and enjoy a beautiful day on their patio. We ordered after waiting for 15 minutes our waiter to even come to our table, we told him we were ready to order and he told us he would get us our drinks first. After waiting another 15 minute to get our ice tea, he finally took our order. Our food was brought to us by a women who looked like she clearly hated her job, she slammed the food on the table and walked away. 

As I went to take my first bite I noticed a long hair draped across my plate. ewwww. I could not find our waitress so I waited 5 minutes and had to flag someone else down, who apologized took my plate and walked away. Our waitress came back another 5 minutes later and asked where my food was, I told her what happened and she apologized and instead of offering to replace us, she told us she would get our check. wtf. 
I was blown away, I did not make a stink because I have worked in the service industry and I know you don't get anything when your rude.... but I wish I would have, because the owner or manager (I'm guessing)brought the bill and left a to go box for my sister. and that was that... they didn't even offer to replace my meal or comp it. 

This place is truly a joke, I will never go back.spent nearly entire evening vomiting after ordering Taylor's Cafe "Joe's special" (ground beef, spinach, onion, etc.) ...a dish I normally love there.  It's the only thing I ate all day, so I'm certain it was this dish.  Awful night.
RichardFor some reason my parents loved the Golden Coin chain when I was a child, and this seems to be the only one left standing. Maybe it was better back then, I don't really know. First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die.Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  

The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.The Great Escape is Closed.  Now, unfortunately, it's the Little Woody.  Another pretentious take over.Dont know why i came back to this location a second time! This place suckkss & lack major customer service. An hour & a half & still waiting...for an oil change & i even scheduled the appt online!!!It was over a year ago that this place ripped me off and I'm still upset about it. I dropped off a queen size down comforter thinking it would be nice to have it dry cleaned rather than hauling it to the laundromat. My husband goes to pick it up after work and hands it over to me when he gets home. I immediately say, "This is not our comforter."  What they'd given to my husband was a queen size synthetic poly-filled comforter that looked like it just came from goodwill or had been used for many years as the roof of a fort. It basically looked and felt very cheap and like something you'd have around for the dog to lie on or to eat on for a picnic at the beach. . I called Arcadia cleaners right away and was told repeatedly that it was my comforter. They said that everything is tagged immediately when dropped off and my tag number matched my receipt. I was told that there are security cameras and I could come look at the tapes. I went the following day and was told over and over again by the owner that what I had been given was what I had dropped off. I showed him that on my receipt the employee had noted that what I'd dropped off was a down comforter and he said that must've been a clerical error. He showed me the security tape and it shows my comforter being tagged and carted off. I don't know how they did it but someone somehow replaced my cozy comforter with the piece of crap comforter that was sent home with my husband. The feelings of frustration and anger were so overpowering I began fantasizing about standing out front of Arcadia Cleaners with signs boycotting the place. What made all of this even worse was the owner was a total jerk. Totally full of himself. I hope whoever stole my comforter at Arcadia is cozy. It cost me $150 and a lot of time and energy. As a school counselor I have little $ and little time/energy to be dealing with stuff like this. Shame on Arcadia cleaners!Rude staff!  I rented two patio umbrella propane heaters for an event.  They were late on delivery the day of the event.  Then on the scheduled pick-up time, post event, they were also late.  I waited at home for 3 hours for the scheduled pick-up.  30 minutes post time block, I called and asked their status, or to reschedule.  The gentleman on the other end told me that now they needed to charge me extra money for a specific time pick-up.  I replied, I don't need a specific time, I just was hoping that you would meet the schedule you had asked for on the equipment pick-up.  I advised that the heaters were on the patio where the delivery technician had placed them the day prior.   The gentleman at A to Z said that again they needed to charge me more money as a "set-up" charge to get them off my patio, where they had placed them originally.  He told me that they needed to be curb side.  So, I alone, had to carry them up a steep driveway, and they were quite heavy.  It was a struggle and massive to handle.  The customer service individuals at A to Z were rude to me and non-helpful.  All they wanted to do is stick me with charges above and beyond already set contract.  I will never use them again!We used to eat here before they shut down. But I am sure the food hasnt changed much nor the horrible rude service. The only decent item was the green chile burritos but still pretty tasteless. I saw the place recently and it still looks exactly the same as it did 8 yrs ago.Haven't been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years, so I thought I would go and get checked out.  My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.

The practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.

He never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.

I appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.

Sooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.  The office is yet to explain the "problem of medium to high severity" described is the CPT code.  The only diagnosis billed is V70.0, adult well visit.

This post is probably more about the billing dept, but still makes me mad.Wow. 
I called ahead to ask a few questions about what was going on with our bikes (we know how to fix up bikes for the most part but don't have a bunch of bicycle tools for when all the gear for your head tube is being funny, or your back hub is messed up). He told us to bring our bikes in for a free estimate and they'd more than likely be able to fix it without too much of a charge. I thought, hurray!

My girlfriend and I travelled by bus to get to this place (as we only have bikes). It took us about an hour (on a Sunday). We get there, he looks our bikes over, and says that it's going to cost $10 for a chain (reasonable) and $15 to put it on. Uhhhh, WHAT? You're telling me that you're going to charge me more than the actual chain to put it on, when if I had brought my little chain tool with me it would literally take me no more than five minutes to put the chain on? That was absolute BS.

He also said he was going to charge $25 to put a front brake on. Please tell me you are joking about that, too. I checked my watch to make sure it wasn't April 1st.

Then after my girlfriend walked outside, I find out that they aren't even going to fix it today (when it in total would have taken them no more than 10 minutes). The hipsters response was, "Uh, well I don't have the time to do it today. It's very labor intensive work." It wasn't. At all. If I had the right bike tools it would have taken me about four seconds to rearrange the bolts for the front wheel.

They're rude. They're pretentious. And they think that I have no knowledge of bikes (simply because I brought the bicycle in), so they're incredible condescending. Not to mention up-charging the hell out of whatever they feel like.

Don't go there. Ever.

Find somewhere else to go.

If you really want an excellent deal and maybe learn a few things in the process, take your bike to Doug at Bikes International in Mesa. It's out of his home, but he took several classes on bicycle mechanics, worked in several bike shops, and now teaches classes on bicycle mechanics. For more info email him at bikesintl@netzero.comI tried. 

I really did. I really wanted this to be "my watch guy" for repair and servicing.

After reading all of the amazing reviews about 'The Watch Repair Company' I decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life. I brought in older Seiko chronograph that needed a battery, cleaning, and some scratches buffed out. I also brought my Skagen World GMT watch that needed a crown replacement, battery, and cleaning along with my Vostok-Europe Anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed (to keep the bezel from falling off).

I was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship. After all, the owner is Russian, one of my watches is Russian, and I even spent some time in Russia, so I knew a little about Russian watches and culture. Gosh this would be great I thought. 

Boy was I wrong. 

Strike One: 
After dropping off the Seiko and Skagen for what I thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up (the owner tells me this), I get a call a week later stating that the Seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the Skagen. 

"Ok, sure. Let me know when it is ready." 

No worries right? I'm not in THAT desperate of a rush to get the watches back. I can wait. About five days after that, he calls me to inform me that the Skagen is ready with the Seiko for pickup. 

"Bring cash, I don't take Visa."

Sure. No problem. His business, his rules. I get it. Well, I pick up the Seiko and Skagen to see that yes, they are fixed, but he did not clean or polish them AT ALL and they were both really dirty still. 

"Maybe he just got busy and forgot?" 

Anyway, while I'm waiting to pick them up there were also several other people (shady looking folks selling gold, and selling it FAST) making deals with him so I felt like mentioning it my "cleaning problem" would not have not warranted a good response at that moment. So I figured I would mention it another time, or just clean them myself as I am more than capable. No biggie. 

Strike two: 
A few days later I I decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in Russian watches. So in good faith (once again) I bring him my Vostok-Europe Anchar, and ask him to fix the bezel. he gives me a "range" for a price and so I drop it off. He wasn't sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it "to a friend" to get it fixed. 

"Ok. Just let me know when it's ready". 

A couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe I need to call the distributer (only a couple in the U.S) and have the parts paid for, and shipped out here so he can fix it. So to recap, a Russian watch "expert" who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch. Hmmm. At this point I decide not to invest any more time into this, as I can now see where this whole thing is going. I decline politely opting to send the watch to RI for repair instead.  

Strike three: 
A few days after the Vostok fiasco I somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he couldn't fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to "easier" repairs for him. 

"Man, I'm trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal" -This what I was thinking at this point. 

I give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my Skagen. Why not? Surely he's got this under control right? 

"Yes, bring it in. I replace with same crystal, $30.00 cash". 

"Great. See you Thursday"! 

Not so great when I visit him though. He takes one look at it and tells me he cannot fix it because the crystal is "too big". Mind you, he had an extensive amount of time with this watch (I presume) because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time. Ugh. 

Here is the deal. I am patience to my own detriment sometimes, I am aware of this. Therefore sometimes I get treated a little poorer by businesses that think I won't do or say anything. I get it. But I really wanted this to by "my watch guy" and I was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end. What else could I do? 

Here is my actual evaluation of his operation:

Got a quartz watch in need of battery? 
See this guy. 

Got ANYTHING of value that you want back in a specific time frame? 
Go to an AD. 

Got a watch over $100 with repairs needed? 
Go to another shop or send it off to an AD or highly recommended place. 

Got gold for sell? 
See this guy for quick cash (it seemed like a popular choice when I was there). 

Sorry, I tried. Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 

One other quick note. The whole "desperate people selling gold and ONLY dealing in cash" made me think that this guy's operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings. Not saying I care, just saying it came across like that to me as I was waiting for my watches.Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.Since I was 8 years old I have been coming here. I am 24 now. That's sixteen years as a customer. We order about 4 times a year for the past few years.

Let me detail some changes. Instead of serving their food in the take out boxes many people associate with Chinese they changed this procedure about a year ago. Now they come on cheap plastic plates with a top that can be sealed. Why does this matter? The volume of food you get in these plates is less than what it used to be. So I let that go, I kept ordering. My orders usually end up about 45-50 bucks.

Yesterday, I had my worst service and food that I have ever received. I MADE a yelp account because I am so pissed off. The Teriyaki chicken was hard, rock hard. It tasted like 2 day old leftovers. The kind that were left under a lamp. The PuPu Platter which costs 9.50 a piece contained jack sh1t. I ordered TWO of them , that is 19 dollars of Pu Pu Platter and the result I took a picture of because I couldn't believe it. 

This is what 19 dollars looks like : http://i.imgur.com/TZhEuV5.jpg

I called back, and was told this was a normal portion. Lol. 

I have been going here for years, and they finally lost me as a customer yesterday. I can say for certainty that I will never order from this place again, and neither should you. 

As an aside I added up 50 an order 5 times a year for 16 years, me and my family have probably spent around 4000 dollars at this one place throughout that time.

Bye bye.seriously, how hard is it to make a decent fast food teryaki chicken bowl? and marble sized shumai?  what in the world?  if you're totally destitute and you can't find any other restaurant to spend your last dime on, then go ahead, you have been forewarned.

how do they stay in business is my questionThis place is definitely showing its age. It has withstood time in that it is still in operation, but it is in dire need of some serious renovation.

The "warm room", which is the snack bar, is often a disaster area.
There is some sort of "camp" for kids, which apparently meets up in the warm room. Then destroys it. Then leaves it like that.
I paid $2.50 for a "deluxe mocha", which was instant coffee, and powdered cocoa. How that constitutes "deluxe" I'll probably never know.
There is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere.
The skates were considerably aged.
Ostensibly in an attempt to clear the condensation on the viewing glass (but failing miserably) there was a large fan blowing the cold air down toward the seating, just to ensure you weren't able to be warm at all. (Not a major problem the day I went, as it was approaching supernova temps outside)
There was actually a diaper on the floor in the "warm room", that remained there for the entire duration I was at the rink, which was almost 3 hours.

I would sooner pay the cost to go to the Ice Den. It is far cleaner, much more maintained, has comfortable seating, much more, and much better amenities.This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people. 

I don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, "No!"Decent pizza and wings, not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request, I'm surprised he doesn't charge for the use of napkins.... Maybe that's next.I really feel as though they took advantage of me.  My starter failed and my car was towed to their shop.  I was able to call around after the fact to get quotes from other shops and found that I was overcharged by $100..  Im not too pleasedThis is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.

We called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  

Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult.I brought a high end Omega in to their repair dept for what seemed an easy fix and had to take it back 3 times because they kept giving it back to me and it was not working. They kept it for almost 8 mos on and off, and when I finally got it back, it worked for about 4 mos and stopped again. When I finally found a true expert jeweler, he said the watch was damaged and had 'plier' marks from someone exerting too much force trying to open it. I'm now waiting to see if it can be salvaged. It will cost me over 3,000.00 to replace it.........BUYER BEWARE!!What a cute place!!
That is about the only positive thing about Aunt Chilada's, unfortunately.  The food is not even mediocre IT SUCKS!!  Started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery!  And the service sucks too :(I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. 

Listen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.

I'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.

All in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again.Been going to Aunt Chilada's for over 10 years now and I'm sad to see the quality of the food and service declining.  I had my wedding reception on the patio 11 years ago and could not have been happier.  Went for dinner last weekend for my wife's birthday and don't know if I'll ever go back.  Our group waited over an hour for our meals to arrive and during that time our waitress only came to the table once to take drink orders.  No one should have to leave their table and go to the bar to order a drink.  The one time our waitress did come by she said there was a mix up with our order.  When it finally arrived 3 of us asked for side of sour cream.  Unfortunately it never came.  Luckily for our waitress we had a large group so gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Otherwise she would not have seen much.We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.

We wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service.Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to. I recently opened an account online with Bank of America. After nearly completing the application, my computer timed out. I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again, so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received. But due to their crappy system restrictions, I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not. 

The following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. 

Going through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. 

I called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious??? 

I asked to speak with a manager, and have currently been holding for 50 minutes. Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster, DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.Worst Bank of America! Came here today to get something notarized. I was the only other customer besides two who were already with a teller. There were two other employees on the side having a side conversation. When the first customer left, I went up to the window and the lady told me her computer just went down. All I wanted to was ask a question, but she told me to get back in line and wait until the next teller was done. Well, after waiting for another 5 minutes, the next teller (a man) was done, and I said I wanted to get a document notarized. His response, "I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask the two over there." The "two" (a lady and a man) he meant were the other two employees who were having a side conversation. Well, I went up to the lady and she told me Philip was the only one certified to notarized and apparently NOW he is with a customer. Of course, after spending 20 minutes there I'm not going to wait. I rather drive to another B of A branch tomorrow to get speedier and better service.Horrible service, their staff has zero customer service and are extremely slow. Don't bother going here to watch football either because you will be inconvenienced. I've been here many times and every single time I've had something to complain about. If you have no standards, this place is for you.I wish I could give it no stars. I had lunch there, and the service was terrible. I don't think I ever got a refill on my drink. Also, I went with 6 people and not one person liked their overprice food. The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor, the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place. Skip it, even if you have a free voucher from the hotel.I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty, nasty smell.  The upkeep of the interior could use some work.  The view, as always, is beautiful but that is about it.  The food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices.  Would not go back. Almost forgot, while waiting for our car I noticed the menu posted in a case outside.  The case had a Yelp sticker on it.  How tacky for a fine dining restaurant.I would give zero stars if possible. Four mix-ups before we could even make it to the table. Staff was rude, unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable, but definitely not a positive one. We will not be back. I recommend going to Top of the Rock instead.i should have walked out the moment i walked in.

duck taped massage chairs??? 

creepy chairs lined agains the wall with fans at the feet? 

we were told pedicures were $20 but they failed to mention the ridiculous $2 upcharge if you pay with a debit or credit card. 

it was so hot in there, too. they need to turn on the ac. 

it was awful. never again.Don't even think about going here unless you enjoy rude customer service and bad work.I saw the reviews, need to take my sick turtle in for examination and they agreed to get me in right away. The quoted me $69.50 over the phone for the visit but once I got there, they said they misquoted me and it would be a $100. I keep the visit, saw the doctor and he recommended a $100 lab test + possibly tube feeding at a costs into the thousands. The total visit was $220. I later found out that the procedures where unnecessary and the charges where way over inflated. These guys are out just to make a buck off of you. Do yourself a favor and find another vet that cares more about pets then just your money.Had a really bad experience. Went with a group of 5 for dinner, service was poor, the food wasn't very good either. We spent most of our time waiting. Our appetizer was the last thing brought out, no apology, no discount, no customer service.So this is my first review because it is hard for me to review restaurants. Having worked in the industry for years i am a little more forgiving than most. So we ordered calamari, it came out black but being adventurous i tried it thinking it was a different kind of breading. Boy was i wrong! It was completely burnt. So we sent it back our other food came out and then the new calamari came out.  Much better this time until we got down to the plate. It was the old plate, same lettuce same number lemons we squeezed on the batch. As some one who has cooked for a living i want to know how lazy a person has to be to do that. Probably won't be going back for a while if at all.Alan was unprofessional, uncooperative and downright mean.  Not sure what's up but I would avoid him at all costs.I went in there, as a first time customer.  Decent gel manicure.

When I went to pay, she claimed that she was having trouble with the machine, brought me out a garbled-looking receipt, where I couldn't make out any numbers, yet the line to sign was clear,  and that she needed to re-do my charge card.  I was having the feeling that I was going to be double-billed, and said to her, I better not be double-charged, which is exactly what happened.  I went in there with both of my receipts (the garbled one, and the 'clear' one), and told them that it had shown up on my credit card statement as a 'double billing', exactly how I thought it would be.  They asked me to provide them with a bank statement - which I did, with all the personal information blacked out.  What a pain in the butt to get a refund!!   When I presented all of that, I was told the manager wasn't in, and she was the only one that could issue me a refund.  And to come back (like I've got all the time in the world, to do that!).

Forget that - I called my credit card company, and they took off one of the charges!!

I WILL NEVER go back there again, for the poor way that I was treated, when it was their mistake.

I don't care about their spa pedicure prices or anything else.  You only have one chance to make a good 'first' impression -- major FAIL!!The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again.Before you go there, check their Better Business Bureau grade- its an "F"!  They already have 3 complaints that they never responded to, and I'm about to file another one!  This is a horrible excuse for a cleaners.  I went there about 5-6 times (wanting to use them because they were cheap and really close to my house), but I never got anything back that was clean or pressed enough to wear.  Now they have ruined 2 pairs of my pants and refuse to take responsibility for them.  Awful people!!!  Run the other direction!!Called about charges on my account that I did not authorize and after a long conversation with "Mike" where I was repeatedly told that I was wrong and he refused to do any thing but charge me additional fees, I was hung up on, Yes, hung up on. I did not swear, but did sound angry (and why shouldn't I be when they hand out my money and then want to charge me to correct it?!? ) 

 I went to their Facebook page to express my disappointment, a post that was removed and then I was blocked so I could not repost,  so that other unfortunate suckers will not see how truly terrible their customer service is and  will continue to be treated like crap by this terrible institution. I have yet to be contacted by anyone about being hung up on, not even by email which I sent nearly 14 hours ago......
 
Well guess what scum bags - you cannot delete this. Enjoy your increasing number of complaints and decreasing amounts of money, you know, that stuff you need to stay in business... 

sincerely, someone who is sick of your long branch lines, hidden fees, and constantly crashing web site.

Buh - there is one star because "no stars" is not an option.This place uses to be about us members but now they are no better then the big banks out there. They will hit you up with fees and even charge a monthly membership fee!  Barf!Yet another bad experience with Arizona Federal Credit Union. This morning I placed an order with a company in Scotland for some clothing. (Yes, a kilt). Two hours later I tried to use my debit card for a $2 breakfast and it was declined. While I am glad to have escaped  BofA's high fees by taking my business to a CU, at least BofA would call when they froze a card for a suspicious transaction. I didn't have to figure it out on my own.
When I called the AZFCU call center to unlock the card they made me feel like it was my fault I wasn't notified.
The staff at AZFCU really need better customer service training. I also bet there is no trouble ticket in their system to get suspicious transaction notification fixed.So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!A friend and I visited on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty, save for a few people at the bar, ourselves included. 
I made the comment to my friend that this place gave off a "Ramsays Kitchen Nightmares" vibe. He laughed. I worried, because the food hadn't arrived yet.

The manager (at least I'm assuming he was, he wasn't just behind the bar, he was all over the place) was friendly enough. Very nice chap. I'd give him 4 stars on personality if I could rate that here.

The prices are a bit overpriced. I had a simple 8" Margherita pizza. At $9 for the pizza, that's more than a buck an inch. Normally price isn't an issue IF the food is worth it. It's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a Margherita. Or so I thought.

The pizza was very bland. They substituted oregano for the traditional basil. This substitute may be acceptable to a lot of you, but not to me. Basil makes a Margherita. In addition, it did not have enough olive oil, and it was a bit cold as well.

The pizza arrived, and as the manager put the plate down, the pizza slid halfway off the plate, and onto the bar. Half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter. Using the spatula, he tried putting the half that fell onto the bar counter back onto the plate. After pushing the pizza around the bar counter several times trying to scoop it up, he apologized.
All I could think to say was - I hope the bar counter was clean. They said it was. I've only their word to take for that.

Did he offer to cook us a new pizza? NOPE.
Did he offer a discount on the check? NOPE.
A few minutes later, he offered me and my friend each a shot of his homemade Limoncello, on the house. It was sub-par.

I give this place a few more months before they're gone. 
And if the owner/manager of Joey's California Bistro is reading this, give Gordon Ramsay a call. Your place would make a great episode. It's just a shame I had the experience of eating in the 'before' version of this place.This place was terrible. My mom, daughter and I decided to try it out for dinner. My daughter ordered chicken fingers which were not that great. My mom ordered a chicken rigatoni which the noodles were crunchy and the sauce was bad. I ordered shrimp Alfredo and the shrimp and Alfredo sauce were spoiled. Service was very slow and the food was not edible. We have never sent food back, but tonight was the exception.Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  

I asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in?  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.

Since then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends.OK, for starters... I'm all about handstands and arm balances. Also, I believe that yoga is about listening to your body and doing the pose that is right for you.  Therefore, if your in a pose and you think you should go deeper than do it!  When I go to a power class and I'm told not to modify and the teacher is overweight, I get scarred that it's going to be a bad class.  Also, power yoga should be taught by type A people. You can be mellow and spiritual, then teach a restorative class. Enough ranting!

Yoga Pura has a nice vibe, but for starts it smells like an old gym, where are the air fresheners and sage folks? Wow!!  The people there are really nice, but the Manger that teaches power should only be allowed to teach level 1 Flow and Restorative classes. She is a very sincere woman and a had a great spirit, but she should not teach power!  Her class was so bad that I barley broke into a sweat. We spent 40 mins in ansana for an 85 min class!!!! That is nuts for a power class. 

I understand the owner Eric is awesome, but he needs to look who is teaching his more advanced classes. Yoga has changed and people are more advanced. This studio is behind the times.

If you want a great yoga studio in Phoenix, then your best option is AtoneYoga! Enough said.Have you ever gotten to a restaurant and then wanted to stab yourself in the hand with a fork? Me neither.

This was my reaction to chilis. I don't ever remember this local neighborhood joint being tasty, but the boyfriend and I edge starving and decided to give it a whirl. 

Our whirl was consistent of waiting in the lobby for over 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledgments us. Not sure where she was but we waited patiently. As a side note, it was 9 pm, and we were the only folks on the lobby.

When we finally got our table, the table was still wet from being cleaned. This does not feel good when one is wearing shorts. The menus were disgusting. They were sticky, ripped, faded, food stuck on gross.

Needless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant.

One star only because I cant put zero and the waitress didn't ask us to pay for our iced tea.We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. 
The restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered 
Nachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again.Seriously what the hell happened to this location!?! I used to come here ALL the time over the past 2 years but I haven't been here for a couple months and disappointing is all I have to say. Came in and sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday it really wasn't that busy and it was just one thing after another. My friend and I had ordered almost the same exact meal (just slightly different) we had the fajita trio I had mine plain and she wanted hers with all the peppers, onions and spices. So our food comes out and to our surprise there is only ONE plate! Seriously idk how this guy did not here the TWO separate orders. Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out. And of course I had to talk to the manager to make sure they didn't just put that one plate (that was completely plain mind you) under the heat lamp to sit there while they cooked the other one. I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up.
So finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!

Needless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing. What was supposed to be just lunch ended up into an early dinner because of their constant mistakes. I never have had a problem here so this was disappointing to say the least. I even remember when the manager who was there at the time first started & it wasn't too long ago and even then he was completely useless with a very unruly customer who was a constant disruption. Seriously bring back the Chili's I'm used to!!Ammaccapanes very bad customer will keep me from ever stepping foot inside again. I work near buy and myself and coworkers frequent it. Lindsay the bar tender and john the bouncer have alway treated me very well. Oct 6 2013 1030pm I took a friend there for a beer and wings. The male bartender put in my order and brougt me a sm pitcher of kilt. My friend got a blue moon. I was waiting for my wings it wasn't busy as I finished my 1st beer. Second beer down still no wings last half beer started and I asked bartender to cancel wings. If I can't enjoy them with the beer what's the point. He acted as if I was being an a$$. And told me he won't void it cause he will have to pay for it. All with attitude. He checked the ticket time and it was over22 min for Wings wtf. I'm not paying for them I stated. He then explained how his boss the owner makes them pay for all voids and walkouts. This is illegal. The attitude and the owner being a jack hole is why I will never return. I will miss lindsay she was always great. If the male bartenders story was true or not. I paid for the drinks gave the tender some labor advice tipped to cover the wings and left. Sad and unhappy. This place craps on it guests threw the owners bad managing and the male bartender has no clue what customer service is about. Don't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar. Really.Ordered a pizza and cheesebread for carryout, when I arrived I was informed that they do not handle bills larger than $20.

After trying to "break" my valid US currency at the nearby CVS (which would not...)

I went back, to have the manager tell me they could not accept my valid US currency.

I guess throwing away food is better customer service than accepting a paying customers money.

I won't be back.We bought a 2011 Lexus at Bell.  Our sales associate was very professional and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, the finance manager was right out of a movie.  A typically use car salesman attitude and persona.  He tried to take advantage of us both on our trade and lease.  I will never buy another vehicle from Bell Lexus.  Next time Scottsdale Lexus.  Buyer beware.Don't plan on picking up a quick cup of coffee-or anything else-on the way to work! You will waste an easy 10" getting through the drive-through: first No One is manning the order mike and when you get to the window to both pay and get your order-there is complete chaos! They seem uncertain as to what you ordered-try to hand-out a completely wrong order-or are surprised you are sitting in your car outside their window in the first place! This place has ABSOLUTELY the worst McD 's  service of ANY I have been to in this country! Isn't there some award they could receive for this distinction?Great food, bad management and service. Get take out!In regards to Cassie or "Ricks" comment. I tried multiple times to get in touch with someone in upper management about my experience. It's funny how a review on social media suddenly makes this important...Too little to late.We visited this place today for the first time.  We've driven by it countless times, on our way to Target, or Chipotle.  We had an Entertainment Book coupon so we decided to check it out.  BIG mistake.

The service was really terrible.  The ladies behind the counter were pretty rude, and obviously did not want to be working there.  The salsa bar was disgusting, with warm salsa (!) which had little to no taste, if that's even possible.  We ordered a barbacoa burrito, a bean and cheese burrito and a kids' quesadilla.  Only the quesadilla was edible.  We are Mexican food aficinados, but this was truly gross food.  (I have an iron stomach and got extremely sick within an hour of eating the barbacoa burrito.)

The icing on the cake of our visit, so to speak, was the cheap wicker type seats on the chairs.  Two nasty splinters became embedded in our young daughter's knit pants/rear end, causing her to cry in pain.  Nice.I've been here several times, always expecting it to be better than it ever actually is.  I could complain about the prices, but I think my cousin and I simply agree that all BBQ joints are overpriced.
So I'll complain about the food.  And the service.  I went in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  Our waitress looked sweaty and kinda high.  We missed the lunch menu (which actually only has 2 items) so we both ordered dinners.  My pulled pork was good enough and my okra was milliseconds away from being carbon.  We both inexplicably had to pay extra for the side orders that we chose to go with our meals.  My cousin said the cornbread (an extra 75 cents for no apparent reason) was the best she'd ever had at a restaurant and she enjoyed the hot links but when our bill came to over $30 we both thought that was about $15 too much.  My bbq beans were alright, nothing special.  I wish I had just ordered their "special", seasoned waffle fries topped with pulled bbq, cheese, and jalapenos.  
Our waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly.   I'm on the fence whether or not to just ban the restaurant from my list of possibilities...I love bbq but ugh.While this food did not make me Kim Jong Il by any means and I don't particularly LIKE Chinese even....steer clear of this place. This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;)

Oh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch. FYI.It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.  

To the negative experience.....
My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, "Can't you speak english?"  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.

I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading....
My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling.We went the evening of my little sister's 21st birthday to get shots to start the night out. She had never had alcohol and was excited to try her first shot. However, the waitress, Amy, was completely RUDE to us! After looking at my sister's ID, went to get a waiver for her to sign because her ID was, of course, still strait up and down. She laid it on the table and said in her snotty tone: "Be prepared, you're gonna be filling out A LOT of these tonight!" The only other words she communicated to us were rude, as well. Of course, the rest of the night, we didn't sign one single waiver. We told Amy we just wanted the two shots and then we'd like the check, but she didn't come back for another twenty minutes after giving us the shots! WE had to flag her down to get her to finally come back to the table, and the place wasn't busy at all. My fiancé and I had been to this Gallagher's many times before and loved it, but Amy ruined our experience and we won't be coming back.  
We came in smiling and she totally killed the mood.In general I prefer credit unions to banks.  I've moved all my money out of banks into credit unions.  
This credit union is the exception.  In short, they stole $10 from me.
The long story is, last year I set up a checking account for our family trust.  In the process I was forced to create 2 savings accounts with token amounts of $5 each.  I was told this was a requirement of credit unions.  What I wasn't told was that come this year and the $5 was still there, they confiscated it from both accounts because of "lack of activity in the account". Even though I had nearly 6 figures in the checking account.
I was not told this when I set this up and I feel I have been robbed!
BEWARE OF THIS PLACE.Terrible pedicure and terrible gel nails. Not a good color selection and they don't put the polish up to your cuticles so both only lasted barely a week. On top of it lady told me only to bring tip in cash, shouldn't even tipped her at that point.Pretty bummed. My dog has been using petsmart for everything.  We use Banfield.  She's loved doggy daycare. She occasionally needs a professional bath and nails trimmed. I picked her up last night she was still wet! Luckily it's hot out. She has matts in her hair! Her nails are not trimmed. I asked she said she did them. Not at all. What a waste! I now need to find a new groomer in fear this happens again.  I think she was in a rush! Regardless I paid full price and not sure what I paid for!We have two dogs and joined the Banfield plan, with the full intention of getting fantastic service while saving money. (Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan. We pay $25 per dog monthly). We have been incredibly disappointed, and here's why:
- Our office visits are never free, the doctors always find a way to charge you for something. One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!? 
- I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you.
- With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my "discounted ones"
- Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our "discounted savings" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online.
- They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract.
- I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash. 

Overall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam. Support local businesses, save money and take your pets to a local pet hospital. Our contract is up next June thank goodness - that cannot come soon enough!!

I posted this same review for the Desert Ridge location because we have taken our dogs to both (in hopes that one was better than the other) - unfortunately, we had the same experience.I cancelled my appointment after waiting over 8 months to be seen because I cannot trust to receive proper care when the office won't even send you a call, email, text or letter to confirm your appointment.  I am a physician myself and cannot believe the office handles scheduling so poorly. I hope the medical care would justify the wait for an appointment but the poor image left by the front office is enough to not want to do business with them.I LOVE Whole Foods...  but this location is seriously lacking.  

Poor service...  Acted like we were an interruption at deli area and we were the only customers even close to this area.   They saw us, said "We will be with in a bit."  Then we Waited for a considerable time, only to be greeted rather gruffly, "are you ready to order?"  

Ordered 2 sandwiches to take on a plane.  We asked can you cut them in half and wrap the halves separately?  Response... "I'll wrap them together and put them in a box."  I again asked, Can't you please wrap the halves separately?  Response...  Irritated exhaling noise and a verbal "OK"

In the future I will stick to the Whole Foods on Mayo Blvd!So unhappy with my experience at this store. LOVE my new GS5 and my coverage has been perfect, but I would recommend avoiding this store.  The day we went to shop we spent at least 45 minutes waiting- not a big deal. They were busy, I get it.  When we finally saw a rep he was very sales-y and kind of pushy. I just told you I'm here for a new plan and phone.... you don't have to sell me. 

Anyway, he tells us about a current regional promotion where we would receive a free 1gb of data for the entire contract length as long as we ported in a local number. Perfect, I wanted to anyway.  After another hour of him fumbling to get the phones set up and numbers ported in we were finally on our way.  

The next day we notice on our phones that our plan says we only have 1gb of data. We call Verizon and they explain that the promotion doesn't start until the second month. Again, not that big of a deal, but pretty annoying that he didn't find that necessary to tell us.

Well, a couple of days ago our second month starts and what do you know, we still only have 1gb!  After speaking with Verizon on the phone they told us the promotion actually started 5 days after we started our plan and the employee just told us about it early. They assured us it shouldn't be a problem, just to go to the store and have it sorted it.

Once at the store my boyfriend received terrible customer service.  He spoke with the manager and she was completely inflexible and unapologetic. I'm sorry, but if your employee is giving the wrong information you need to do the right thing and honor it. 

If we had known it wasn't starting yet we could have simply waited a couple of days to start our contract.  Now we are stuck in contract for two years with different terms than we thought we were agreeing to with a company that doesn't honor their promises.I like the quality over quantity approach. The tanks are nicely set up and clean. My fish are doing well other than a few missing scales from being taken from the display tank. Ive noticed they still sell deformed fish at full price though. One day I went in and it took over 20 minutes to get a simple yes or no question answered. The customer service was so bad I give them a 1 star review despite the quality. I won't be coming back.Totally never coming back to this or any bashas store. I had an issue with a very rude employee at this store (who also had a huge chew in his mouth). I called to talk to the manager about it and lo and behold it is the manager with the chew that was rude. So..I go to their website and leave a message in their comment/complaint section. It says that you will receive a response within a couple days. Never got a call back to discuss. So, the final step....a negative yelp review. Sorry Bashas I tried to reach out and you slapped me. Off to Frys from now on!Exceedingly slow, even though they didn't seem that busy. Very poor quality wash. They actually smeared dirt on previously spotless areas on the interior.I can sum up Red Devil in a single word : disappointing. My husband and I both have a long history with Red Devil, both together and before we knew each other. It was almost always go-to place for family birthday celebrations and we even had our first date there several years ago. In the past three years, Red Devil has declined in food quality and taste and the prices have sky rocketed. It has gotten to the point where we now push for our celebrations to take place somewhere else, because it has been a consistently disappointing experience for all of us.  Our visit today prompted my review - we once again visited Red Devil for a birthday celebration. We opted for a medium cheese people because if you opt for one of their specialties you're looking at about $15 for a medium - they also have pasta entrees that share the prices of a high quality Italian restaurant, which they are not. We were there with a group of about 10 people and the rest of the place was literally empty. It took them 15 minutes to get our drinks from the time we sat down and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. On top of being slow, the waitress was also extremely rude, although she would have gotten more of a tip than she decided to add to our bill, oh well. This is very disappointing, we used to love Red Devil so much.I recently visited the David's Bridal Paradise Valley store while visiting my future in-laws after Christmas. My future mother-in-law really wanted to be involved in the dress shopping experience so I thought I would make my first shopping trip while visiting her. My future sister-in-law was in town too so I thought it would be a nice chance for her to be involved too. I didn't expect to find my dress as I am SUPER picky and it has taken me MONTHS to find dresses for things before. My wedding isn't until October, so I had 10 months and wasn't too worried. 

When I called to make the reservation for an appt at the Scottsdale store, I was diverted to the Paradise Valley store as the Scottsdale location was under renovation. Not a big deal as the PV store is only 20 min away. I had a terrible experience with Sierra at the PV store. They had warned me that the she would have another client, and I had informed my future mother-in-law and my aunt of this as well. It took her about 20 minutes to come greet me at the front of the store. I didn't try on my first dress until I was 45 minutes into the appointment. Sierra had pulled dresses for me but I was standing there in the slip and corset top they had me put on for 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting for her and had my aunt help me into the first dress. It was a Vera Wang I had been interested in, but I looked like a cream puff (not David's Bridal or Sierra's fault... just not a good look for me). I tried on only one of the other dresses Sierra had brought out of the 4 because I didn't like the dresses she pulled. I kept waiting for her to help me; however, Sierra barely ever came back. She only seemed to come back when she was requested and only helped me in and out of one dress.

I had told her exactly what I didn't want and she kept bringing stuff that had things I didn't want. She was VERY NICE, VERY PROFESSIONAL, and handled my relatives without getting frustrated. However, they were frustrated with her. My future mother-in-law had to pull a lot of the dresses, and most of her pulls were ones I actually liked. Most of Sierra's pulls were ones I did not. She pulled some silhouettes that were nice but nothing that wowed me or really impressed me.

The dressing room wasn't big enough for the dress, much less the dress and two people. The store itself looked unimpressive. Sierra just was not a good match for me. They didn't have the Melissa Sweet line which was my fav dress when looking through magazines, but Sierra told me the Scottsdale store had the line but probably not the dress. She didn't take the 2 minutes out to call and check for me, but I did.  They had it and accommodated a walk-in. The Scottsdale store set me up with Alison and she was amazing. Even though she too had another client, she made me feel like her only client and she was SO sweet and nice. I really appreciated her and everything she did for me! Because of Alison, I found my dress (turns out the Melissa Sweet I loved wasn't it either) and I ACTUALLY feel like a bride now.  I recommend going to the Scottsdale Fashion Square store EVEN IF THE Paradise Valley store is closer. The rooms are bigger, nicer, and the seating is more comfortable for your family. They have mirrors IN THE ROOMS and the selection is much nicer. The store appears smaller than the PV store but it is SO MUCH nicer than the PV store. Trust me, you won't regret skipping PV and going straight to Scottsdale.  (Ask for Alison too! :))Wow! I won't be going here. I called to ask a simple question about whether they carry an item and was treated like I was stupid because I don't know the details of their business or what kind of inventory they carry. If this is how they treat their potential customers on the phone I'm afraid I won't be one of them.Just nasty! Very cluttered and overpriced.Nice guy behind the counter, but very stingy on the meat. I asked for 2 dishes, both "Large" meaning extra meat but it still was paltry. I asked for a meat/chicken combo w/brown rice and he got it right. I also asked for a large white meat chicken with NO rice, but more veggies. I guess that was too complicated.

Both dishes served in a plastic bowl 5/6th full of rice, a thin layer of veggies and a thinner layer of meat.

It took exactly 75 seconds for my order to be passed to me. If this was McDonald's , that'd be normal.  For a teriyaki place, that's an obvious indication of 'pre-cookery' so who knows how long ago the meat was made.

I just moved here and I really hope this isn't the best Teriyaki this area has to offer.
I also got some chicken wrap thing, which was actually pretty good, well 2 of them as that was my own "delivery reward".
Paid $19 for the entire order.

I won't go back since I'm not into paying all that $$ for a huge bowl of rice and very little meat.

This place would not last 1 week in Seattle. (or many other places for that matter)Very very odd place. Will not be returning, extremely loud, forget having a conversation with anyone. We were by the front door and this stage on the other end of the bar, and still couldn't hear each other. 

Def a dive bar. Mostly men, keep a close eye on your wife or girlfriend. They'll be snatched if you're not careful. Lots of HOG members and other motorcycle clubs present. This crowd makes me somewhat nervous, and my husband is a 250lb biker.Horrible!! In September 2013, we took my daughter's Yamaha trumpet in for a minor repair. In January, they still had not repaired it. In February, when we returned again not only had it NOT been repaired, they had somehow caved in one of the valves. They did not charge us, but in no way did they offer to try to make it better or even apologize for the additional damage they did. A completely shameful way to do business. Customer beware.NEVER go here.  This place will rip you off eventually.  I sent a friend here who knows little about cars - she told me the customer service reps were making prank calls to other stores as she was waiting for service.  THEN they installed the wrong size tire on her car - four of them, in fact, which could have damaged her struts.  WHY?!?!?  

After her experience here, I realized that they had failed to follow basic instructions of mine when I had bought several new tires, with the end result that I drove around for six months with no spare tire (partially my fault, of course, I should've checked that the tire floating around my trunk held air - I might've noticed the large gaping hole in the tire at some point).  I hereby resolve never to return to Discount Tire.  Apparently, they're managed by Neanderthals.Walking in to this sprint store is a drag, no one greets you and if you do get lucky enough to get the help of one of the employees, in my experience, they act like its such a chore to tell you about their phones. When I went, there wasn't a single customer in the store besides myself and my sister, and 4 employees were chatting away! One tore himself away from them just to inform me that all the phones i was looking at were the exact same and he cant say that any are better quality than the other because there isn't a shred of difference between them- the epic 4g, evo shift and evo 3d. I was like ooookay and left having felt none the wiser about getting a new phone.This review pertains to Sprint National, not a particular Sprint store.

Quite frankly I'm surprised that all of the Sprint reviews aren't one star.

Unfortunately we've been with Sprint for 13 years.  We get a discount on our plan so we're kind of handcuffed to the rate which is good, but it's the cell phone service which is awful.

If you're considering Sprint and you live in Arizona, take this into account:

-Cell coverage is spotty everywhere, including central Phoenix.
-Forget about internet.  I could drive back home across the valley and use my computer quicker than using my Sprint phone.  I don't even attempt to use the internet with my Sprint phone any more.
-No 4G areas and none on the radar.

And I'm not even mentioning their poor/extremely frustrating customer service.Our waiter smelled horrible! It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent. I just can't believe he thought he could add onto our bill and get away with it!Unhappy customer here! I ordered orange scones (apparently they don't do plain scones???) for a tea party for my husband's niece. I  called in the order in about a week before the party. 

Picked the order up on the day of party, only to find out that they had made cranberry scones.  I hate cranberries. I pointed this out, and their response was they could make some, but they would not be ready until the next day. Not helpful since the party was that day. 

Come on guys. Not only that, but they weren't really scones. Scones are a little on the hard side hence the need for cream and strawberries. These were more like big flat muffin tops. Big fat cranberry muffin tops.Always late!! Have never had an appt that I did not wait for over an hour. They have wasted my time for the last time.Horrible service and it took forever!!! Never going to use them again. I tried to like them because they were close to my house but now I will drive further to go to Danny's.I really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures. 

Unfortunately there is a sign on the window that says they are closed due to family emergency and will reopen January 25th. 

Still not open and it's March.

I wish the best for their family and hope they get back to making delicious food soon. I'll update this review once they open back up. This is informational only.Avoid at all costs. If you go there for an eye exam they will robocall you every day a year later reminding you for an eye exam. Also, I was given a prescription that was way too strong. I had to throw my new expensive glasses away. I ended up going to Q Vision for LASIK. Couldn't be happier. Go here and expect a robocall every day at 5:05.This is long, the moral of the story is skip this place for sure, and go somewhere-anywhere-else. 

My sister goes to this place every once in a while for a polish change, so when I was thinking about getting a manicure for myself I decided to come here. I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat. 

I walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.

 An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off. 

Frustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were "too busy" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation. 
She apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left. 

The shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails). 

Moral of the story, this is a horrible place to have your nails done. Skip this place and go somewhere with better service!!2/2/11- Talk about going downhill! Dunno know if it is a new mgr or what but when I get a roll with my salad and the bottom half is covered in black mold...EEK! 

This little stuck-in-the-seventies place is the restaurant at the Belair Golf Course off of Bell Rd. Its really somewhat of a hidden gem though if you're looking for regular ol' American food. Its quiet, has a lovely view of the lake, peaceful, good service and above average food. The breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite. Its actually real steak not some pre-breaded b.s. I like the club sandwich for lunch- generous amounts of meat, fresh lettuce & tomato, hot fries- how can you go wrong? My only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor. Its perfectly fine, I guess. It's clean. Its just so seventies. But, hey, go there to relax with friends, get a drink from the bar and soak up the seventies charm.Horrible horrible service. Beer and food is great, neighborhood bar so it's convenient. Went in today for my last time. They were short handed which I could understand, but the managers were even terrible. Server never brought our food, let alone check on us. I had to get up to get a beer, napkins, plates, etc. Had to basically yell and wave my arms just to get the check...we complained about the service only to get a "thumbs up" and a smile then walked away....LITTERALLY. No joke. The manager kept saying he would get our server to us, which never happened. All tables around us were just as unsatisfied.  Too bad for them, I know after today many people will not be back.This place is terrible. The meat tasted like asshole.I ordered merchandise online with my credit card and chose in store pick up to avoid the shipping fees. When I arrived at the store, I parked in the space designated for in-store pick up. For some reason, this is located on the complete opposite side of the store from the pick up booth. No one mans this booth so I had to wait for an employee to be called. 

I showed him what I ordered and he went to the back. He returned about 5 minutes later and asked me again what I had ordered. This time I handed him the receipt I had brought with me. He returned a few minutes later and said the order was canceled cuz I had not picked it up quick enough. I told him that I had already paid for the items and it had not even been 10 days since the order. He said the order was canceled several days back and that I had not been charged for the items. I went home disappointed and checked my statement to find I had indeed been charged for the transaction. The employee did not seem to care one bit about the situation. When I asked if I could pick out the same products from the store, I was quickly rebuffed.Customer service is terrible  doubt I will ever go backI went to Ulta in Desert Ridge and was really disppointed.  I came in to get my hair trimmed about forty-five minutes before they closed.  When I came in there were two stylists sitting in the waiting area talking to the receptionist.  They asked if I had an appointment (I didn't) and then told me they couldn't take me so late, which was fine.   Then one of the stylists, an older gentleman, found it necessary to lecture me for a good five minutes on how late it was, which I thought was terribly rude.  It's a shame, because I work and live very close and was hoping to find a good salon in my area.Terrible! Service was blatantly rude and unattentative, they encourage you to sign up for their email list and then when you inquire about the emailed advertisements they won't honor them. Happy hour menu has only 3 sushi rolls, they ran out of draft beers (which were on special or $3, then charged us $5 for the same beer in a bottle), food was so-so, and they charge a 5% tax per bill for dining in. This was my second trip and I am very unimpressed, will not be returning!!!For the love of gawd...what crappy, sub-par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend $70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us.Disgusting Chinese food. After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back...NO NO NO, this placemakes Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage food!Everyone out there do not order from this place it is horrible disgusting and spoiled food Go Go China is horrible horrible horrible and they will not even give my refund back and didn't even eat my food  they shouldn't even stand in businessI went in there for the first time and it sucked! I asked to post a flier about a free dog walk event, but the lady couldn't be bothered and she shook her head at me. I know she was on the phone, but she could have waited until she was off the phone to give service. I was going to buy supplies, but forget it! I could understand them not wanting to post a flier, but they could have done something other than shake their head at me.  Never going back!Apparently not being a regular means you don't get service.
Waited 25+ minutes for the one and only waitress. When we saw her chatting with another table we asked the hostess if we could order. She said our waitress would be right with us and then proceeded to run over to her (waitress) and tell her we were waiting. It took another 3 minutes for her to come over to take our order.
11 more minutes for drinks followed by 8 minutes of waiting on our appetizers (everything was ordered at the same time mind you). The pizza finally came another 12 minute later (31 minutes after ordering).
Food - OK for bar food
Service - Some of the worst service I've ever seen! Granted we did see our busser 8 times! Our waitress 3...Last night my wife asked me if I wanted anything when she was going out shopping, I said, "sure get me some egg foo young/" We'll she brought me home some of the worst egg foo young I have ever eaten anywhere from Yunan Wok. She has been begging me to stop there for weeks since she got a flyer in our house door. I checked it out on Yelp and it confirmed much of what I had already thought, too expensive and even worse the food reports were awful. 

We'll now I can concur. My egg foo young had to be premade frozen patties. They do not put the meat in the omelet mix, rather serve it with the sauce. I can say there was an ample portion of barbecue pork in my order but it could not make up for the awful patties. The texture was grainy. No sign of fresh bamboo shoots, bean sprouts or anything else that provided texture. My wife's chicken and broccoli was nothing to write home about either. We are used to getting a container of the main course with a separate container for rice. This was served in a typical to go lunch container, which in itself wouldn't be that bad, but the portion was small, and I mean small. 
My wife will not shop there again for sure.I have been a patient here for my over 6 years, however the many of the old doctors have retired, and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctors.

I made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which I believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone.  Two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back.  On appointment day I was told that I would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm.  Of course the rash took precedence at the time, so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started I was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain, unacknowledged and ignored by the doctor.

Word of advice: If scheduling an appointment here, do NOT schedule with Dr. Luis M Irizarry.  He doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day.Wow this was place is so creepy and the customers are just as creepy,A friend of mine hade mentioned that this place had good breakfast,so I thought I would give it a try.I walked in the joint to give it a try and the looks i got when i walked in where enough to make me want to run out I have never seen more racist freaks crammed into a small place in my life,The Career sever was just as racist as all of the freaks in the joint, just rude as hell,Bottom line if you you want to experience phoenix racism at it's best go to 40th st Cafe,food cold service terrible and rude career waitress from hell, i would warn anyone who is not white and ignorant to not set foot in this place,more freakks and employees crammed into this place than i have ever seen!Stay clear unless your writeing a book on racism in phoenix at its best.I usually don't like to complain but this was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been a part of.
Granted, it was midnight and clearly the people working there got the short end of the stick when it came to their shifts but nonetheless, that's not an excuse.

-Got there at 12:05, didn't receive our food until after 12:50.
-Didn't bring all of the food out (clearly forgetting to place the order in the first place)
-Overcharged us on the bill
-Rarely checked if we needed anything (water, anything else, etc.)

I wish I could say all of this wasn't on one dining experience, but I'd be lying. 
I like to keep things positive but I had to write a review.

Eat here if you're desperate :)They need to fire that bitch Ashleigh. ...I did not tip you today because of the stuck up bitch attitude you had with me & with the mother and her sons before me.So, after putting in a complaint with Hilton, I received an email back basically blaming Expedia. My email only briefly mentioned the confusion with the continental breakfast but mostly described the filthy room, and the way the manager handled my stay. I sent an email back on 12/23/13 explaining all the complaints I really had with the hotel and never heard back! Great way to stay on top of their customer service! Well on a positive note, at least I know not to even consider a Hilton as a venue for my wedding... or as a hotel choice EVERThe Carolina's in Peoria, AZ is run by anti-white Mexican American gang bangers. They sneer at you when you walk up to the counter to place your order. 
Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent. The counter service is terrible and there must be half a dozen vatos standing around doing absolutely nothing.
The management at the original Phoenix location needs to take a drive out to Peoria and see just why customers are not returning here.Nightmare! Rented from this facility through Priceline for a fair price...$136 for one week. When I realized my car would not be fixed within the specified time, I called a day later and told them....they said not a problem, keep it as long as necessary. I ended up at the end of a 18 day period with a $2,218.00 bill; which I am still disputing. Even though the agent TOLD me my daily rate was $23 a day for every day over, I did not READ the fine print stating it was actually $90; not what she SAID. Thank GOD, for American Express who is helping me fight this issue. No one in their right mind would pay $90 a day for a compact car. They are a shady car company who is loosing their ground to companies like Alamo and Hertz, so take advantage of consumers who don't bother to read the fine print when renting through Hotwire and Priceline. Completely fraudulant.Take a number and wait. I've had a 12+ hour day of training and airline hell, now I get to wait an hour for what will be a substandard rental car. There are 10 rental stations and only 5 CSR's manning them. Horrendous customer service. My company arranged this rental so I have no choice this time. But Budget - especially this location - will never get my personal rental car business.After talking about the New Times in the forums, I thought I should probably bring my opinion here!

I used to read the New Times regularly and really enjoyed their articles. I ate up their stories on Arpaio and other political subjects.

But then a group I'm part of was the subject of a really deceptive column, and I learned an acquaintance of mine had a feature article written about her in which they completely fabricated some quotes, and then there's the whole 'April Fool's' fiasco with the article on the chef who prepared endangered species...

Anyway, bottom line is that the New Times is here to provide entertainment at their subjects' expense, and very rarely provide news. I still read it sometimes for a laugh or to check out event listings, but that's about it. I'm sure there's stellar information in here every so often, but I'd rather not wade through the bullshit to find it.I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere.Plus's  - Free WiFi, no arms on seats.

Minus's - Long distance between terminals. Bus service between terminals slow. Have to go thru security again between terminals. Security checkpoints REALLY slow. Three columns for going thru security, regular coach, first class, parents w/children and wheelchairs. What this means is that for regular coach passengers it takes more than a half hour to get thru the damn security screening checkpoint so Good Luck if you're trying to catch a flight in another terminal.

  Also, hardly any screens that show flight/gate information. If it's not on your boarding pass or if your boarding pass gate # is wrong, good luck finding what gate you're supposed to be on.The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...

Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...

I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)Wow, many unexpected, extra, and hidden fees!!!!!!!!!  Still waiting to find out why they made additional charges on my credit card two days after I returned the car!  Never again.Got to the security checkpoint and it was a really long line. Then I heard a guy checking bags acting really rude and yelling at us about having to do extra bag checks because we're stupid. So then the line had like 70-100 people in line because they were doing a shift change. The line didn't move for 20 minutes AND a worker came to our side of barriers and started yelling and saying we have too many bags and we don't follow instructions when they scan our items. Worst of all, he told us all that it was our fault if we miiss our flights since we didn't know what we were doing. They took their sweet time, kind of chatting it up during their "shift change. A guy finally said something and the worker got even louder saying that people talk shit to him all day and the customer wasn't going to ruin his day. The regular man didn't say anything but the worker kept going and going. PHX definitely needs to get a hold on the behavior of their employees.... and I almost missed my flight! I made it just in time for final boarding.Been flying in and out of this airport for the past 6 yrs.  The only positive thing about this place is that it's right off the freeway.  With that said, they have the ABSOLUTE worst check-in process at the security gate.  There's no getting around it.  You'll be in line for a solid 45 min to an hour so plan accordingly.This airport is garbage on so many levels.  You can show up here 2 hours early and miss your flight.  Not just you, like your whole plane full.  It's a joke.  Seriously, many PHX folks drive to Tucson.  That's 5 star airport.My mom was going to be coming back from the airport at a time I was unavailable to pick her up. We decided what made the most economical sense was to drop her car off at an airport parking lot for her to pick up the next day instead of spending a lot of money for a week of parking or a super shuttle to her house. So I found a coupon for this parking lot where we have parked many times in the past for $6.50/day with a free shuttle from the airport. 

When she picked up the car the next day she gave the ticket to the attendant which is supposed to tell them what to charge based on how long you have been there. The car was there for less than 24 hours. When the attendant first rang up the ticket there must have been a prior ticket still in the system because she told my mom her total was $23.50. What?!? My mom told her it had been there less than 24 hours and that she gave her a coupon for $6.50. So the attendant corrected it and told my mom that her total is $9.50. When my mom asked about the difference between $6.50 and her total she was told that it was a $3.00 fuel and service charge. 

This "fuel and service charge" is ridiculous. The coupon says $6.50 per day. Said nothing about additional fees may apply. Also advertised "free shuttle". So clearly the shuttle is not "free" if this fuel and service charge applies. When I dropped the car off I was not told about any additional fees either. 

$3.00 is not a huge amount but I went here specifically because of the coupon. If I had known other fees would be added on top of the price I would have found her cheaper pricing elsewhere. I will not be returning here for my airport parking needs in the future if they tack on unannounced "fees" at the end. The attendant was very rude to my mom when she questioned the fee and the attitude was pretty much...if you want your car back pay it...My girlfriend and I ate here in 2012. We both took violently I'll within 12 hours. We alerted the manager in person, via phone call from both of us and in writing via email. Their response was one of denial, lack of empathy and a complete disregard for customer service. We notified them not to finger point but out of public health concern and Casey the manager was put off by this. She stated "do what you need to do to make yourself feel better". I caution you to eat here, they may make you sick. They don't care about their customers,  suggest try another steak place.Very bad customer service! Evelyn in food section had terrible customer service, Kim in tickets was very rude!!!!! No one there smiles but one security guard. The rest looked liked they hated there job! No manners! No help! I'd rather pay tufesa or El Paso Los Angeles limo bus then these jerks!My recent experience with the Phoenix Greyhound Bus station was terrible.  

First, I bought a ticket (in person at the Greyhound counter)..  leaving Phoenix, AZ (destination Indio, CA)at 9:00am on Friday... the bus was boarding, I'm in line... when the doors were closed by Phoenix Greyhound staff, stating the "bus was full" and a number of us "had to wait until the next bus."  When I asked how it was possible to be "full" ... when I still had my ticket in my hand., I was told that a "ticket" does not guarantee a seat.

The next bus I was told which would leave for "Indio" about 4 hours later.  So, I was given a "priority" seat for that bus.  After waiting the four (4) hours, I again stood in line, and was then told by the driver ... "I don't stop in Indio" ... I explained that I had been given "the priority pass" ... he stated that I should "talk to the counter" ... Went back to the counter... was told ... next bus for Indio would be in six (6) hours 

So... terrible service, inaccurate information, waited additional ten (10) hours ... 
If you can avoid Greyhound (in Phoenix) ... do so.Once again, an issue. This time I went to kiosk t o purchase ticket, kiosk malfunctioned and said for me to see an agent at counter, I went to counter and explained my situation and,  Shauna (spelling?) Started showing a co worker pictures o cupcakes while I stood there, AFTER I EXPLAINED I NEEDED ASSISTANCE, then when I asked her by she felt the. Need to show picture a,while I needed assistant w she threw a fit and handed me a complaint form then stomped into her office like a 2 year old who didn't get a cupcake, she unprofessional and rude#!  greyhound has been a huge disappointment my last 2 trips, from now on I will just rent a car, I don't feel safe on greyhound, the employees have provided more negative then positive experiences.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! I  am a landlord and unfortunatley currently out of town and this company totally tried taking advantage of the siutuation! My  AC unit was acting up in 110degree temp and they sent a tech out who totally misquted and later to find out mis diagnosed.  For what they needed to replace they qouted me $1700. I thought this was high so I called 2 other companies through Yelp and the 2 other companies qouted me $1010 and $990. Then when I declined to use them and I told them exactly why, she charged me $195 for 3hrs of examination when it probably took 1hr and that was to call around for parts.  I will never use this company agaion and totally advise anyone to stay away!EEEW NO! THIS PLACE IS SUPER, MEGA TACKY! WAY GHETTO! When My son was younger (6) he asked me to take him there, I did! And OMG we both hated it! And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible. The people that go there are all shady looking, I'd say a dangerous crown. This place is NO FUN! And It's a scary crowd. yukky!it only has a few rides. the park is old and needs to be redone. there are no rides for kids which is a big issue for me. the bathrooms are so disgusting its pathetic. to much chaos. nay as well take the time to go somewhere better. i think its over priced for the little that they do have. it should only cost five dollars for locals.People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order.This place sucks.  Just got back from lunch after trying it for the first time.  I wanted a pita and greek fries and when I placed my order, the guy charged me for a combo and mumbled a number.  When my order came up, I pointed out to the stupid b*ch giving me my food that I ordered greek fries and she looked at the ticket and said "well, you paid for a combo, that comes with regular fries" and then she shoved the order at me and walked away.  Needless to say, I won't be going back!This place is a dump. I got hepc just waiting for my chicken kabob salad which took 20 minutes. Salad dressing I think was dirty dishwater, the lettuce was collected from the floor from under the prep area.  
Chicken was burned so the taste of burnt hair lasted in my mouth all day. 

Everyone who works there hate their lives from what I can gather very rude, and have the personality of a dishrag. 

If you like 3rd world fast food this port-o-potty is the stop.As an update, more than three weeks have passed, and we still have not received a follow-up call from the doctor.  The only vet we have ever had who failed to follow-up...  I'm disappointed, but not surprised.  And frankly, after all we've been through, we would rather not talk to him again.Be very careful if you decide to take your pet here for tests.   I went there last week on the recommendation of a local vet after that vet took x-rays of my 11 year old lab's spine and saw something that looked suspicious.  The resident I saw, Dr. Phillip Schissler, after examining her (and her x-rays from the first vet) recommended a whole slew of tests totaling over $3200 so that they could make a define determination.   I only approved part of the tests, despite their urging to put my dog through all of them and it turned out to be cancer.  There's not a doubt in my mind that  this facility already knew what was wrong with my dog after looking at the first set of films that I brought in, yet they had the audacity and the lack of ethics to prey on my emotional state to push for very expensive tests that weren't needed. Even after they told me that she had cancer, they pushed to do a biopsy to determine what kind of cancer and I said no.  She had to be put to sleep 3 days later because the cancer was so advanced so certainly a biopsy wouldn't have been needed.   DO NOT let them push you into paying for tests that aren't needed or don't make sense and question every recommendation they make.  Shame on this center for preying on emotional pet owners when they already know what's going on - do the right thing and don't put pet owners through any more undue hardship because you have business goals and want to line your pockets with our money.My group of about 8 people stopped in here on a dead Friday night.  We were looking to grab a bite to eat and get some drinks.  There was practically nobody in the bar so we thought the waitress would welcome some business.  Apparently we were wrong.  She was rude right off the bat, pissed because we pushed 3 empty tables together.  Then we asked if she could split the checks and she said yes, but she couldn't guarantee she would get everyone's order right and we would have to live with it.  What?  It took her 10 minutes to even come and take our order, then another 15 minutes to get us the drinks.  We left after 1 drink because she was so rude and unwelcoming.  Which is her loss because I'm sure she would have made at least $50 in tips off of our table.  I don't know if she was having a bad night or if she was upset because she had just realized how bad her bleached blonde mullet looked, but either way it was unacceptable.Where do I start with this?  I am used to the Discount Tire that makes sure their customer is taken care of.  I had a tire blowout on the freeway on a Sunday afternoon.  I towed my car to this shop as it happened to be the nearest one to where my car broke down at.  Being a customer, I knew 2 things.  1, my tire was flat and 2, Discount tire would fix it.  I left my car in their parking lot overnight and called them first thing Monday morning to advise them of the situation.  They said that they would get everything taken care of, that they would be fine only having to replace the one tire, and it would be done that same day.

So I picked up my car that afternoon, happy as a clam.  One of the employees (Victor?) seemed to be in a rush and while my credit card was giving me problems, he was pressuring me to just use a different form of payment and call my credit card company later.  That wasn't very nice.  Regardless, I was happy to be over the situation and I drove my car home.  

The next day (today), I got ready for work.  On my way out of the Starbucks parking lot, I notice the same exact wheel that they fixed was yet again, flat.  It had barely enough air in it for me to lug it to the nearest QT and fill it with air.  I then proceeded to the nearest discount tire to that location (4th ave and Bell).  It was then revealed to me that the tire that and the blow out, the same tire that was then again flat, was flat and was having tire issues due to a CRACKED RIM.  

Now.. I am not saying my rims were in perfect condition.  In fact, I knew that they had seen better days.  But words cannot convey how it felt to know that they did not fully inspect my rim as they should have for safety/hazard reasons.  

If they had only taken an additional 3 minutes.. THREE minutes... to check the rim and see that it was cracked, I would have GLADLY paid for a new set of rims and tires right then and there.  Times like that it is not about money- it is about safety and I TRUSTED them to tell me that my car was or wasnt safe to drive.  They were NEGLIGENT in not checking for my safety and literally, put my life at risk.

I can't imagine what could have happened if I didn't notice the flat this morning and kept driving up the freeway to work.  Another blowout during rush hour?  

This discount tire put my life at risk and it is my mission to make sure that this gets as far as it can.  This can happen to ANYONE.  I am lucky that I caught it before it was too late.


I would not recommend this discount tire to my worst enemy.After reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews I was hesitant to post mine thinking I just had a bad experience. I decided to try my luck again and went to Ponchos for dinner last night. I now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible. First of the all the place used to be a house, now converted to a restaurant. Usually this is a great and charming idea, but it doesn't seem to work for me. The rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or (loudly) overhearing the table next to you. Imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom.. To close for comfort.

The food - I'm sorry my fellow yelpers but I honestly think it is horrible. The chips have always been to greasy, they only serve hot sauce and you have to pay for salsa. Lame. I have had many entrees (where's the pollo under all this fundido) (chimichanga greasemanga) but last night won the "most disgusting entree" award. I order the Steak Picado (I think that's what it was called) and it came out overcooked and cold. The rice and beans were barely edible, the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold (what appeared to be) sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak. It was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up..  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was even worse, the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time. They were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce. It was so bad he didn't even eat it.
Don't get me wrong - I love Mexican, all types and usually the heavier the better, but Ponchos is a place I will not be returning. Yes it was really cheap, but you get what you pay for.. Picture attached.Alright, it hurts me to do this, but after today, Poncho's is dead to me. I was a faithful customer for years as I grew up in the Laveen area. I returned today, excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic. 

Bleh. It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby. Don't get me wrong, I love babies, but every reasonable person has limits. Also, our waitress was awful. I'm not usually too picky, but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was. She was morose, made no effort to engage and everything we wanted, we had to chase her down for. 

And we arrive...at the food. The zucchini appetizer is off the menu, big disappointment. My beef tamale was awful. I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned. My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees. The salsa is still good, but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks. 

Sorry, Poncho's. You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit.WARNING: Everything is super deep fried... Been here twice and everything was way to greasy.

Have have been told they have a great happy hour including $10 pitchers of Margaritas. I'll shall have to try and repost my findings...Four stars for the food.
Another cumulative star for the service, making them a solid five.
That was before we checked out.

Minus five for their not having a defibrillator anywhere on site when my heart began missing beats right after their informing me how two cups of turkey soup, one half sandwich, a whole sandwich, two iced teas, a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to forty-seven bucks.

I must have appeared to the cashier as a mouth-breather and to everyone else in line when I stood there, frozen, vegetatively reverberating;  "huh....forty-seven bucks...really...how is that even possible???
[head shake]

Eventually, my friend's laugher brought me back. 

But it was my turn to pay for lunch, so I couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out. This place is in the middle of BFE, with nowhere else to eat except the desert, and I don't care for cactus or rocks...so I sucked it up
and did the only thing I could do under the circumstances.

I sat there eating my lunch....fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich. 

Not going back.Great selection of pots, not great prices and customer service is poor. Do not buy plants from them. The plants are grown in california so they offer no warrenty and they are overpriced to boot.They do have a written return policy posted that states no refunds are given, only store credit. I tried to return a plant  for credit and was told the pollicy is only for pots. After spending over $1000.00  I was fine with store credit as I would have liked to have choosen another plant but now I am stuck with it despite the policy not making the differntiation. As a bussiness owner myself I would have honored the policy i posted. That is why I say they have POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.I would not even give you people a star. You all are hopeless!!! From the ladies at the front desk to the guy who cant speak english and cant fix a simple molding because i ended up redoing it myself. I can not believe someone lets this place run like this. I have nothing against mexicans but its funny how much different im treated because im white. Little did you guys know i can understand alot and may end up leaving before you guys even know. You wouldnt know till the 8th of the month to come check anyway.A group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night, and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples. They ordered some food and drinks, but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their IDs. They did nothing but want some food and drinks. One of them was asked to leave immediately, and the group asked why they needed to leave. The bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder. Eventually the group got up to leave without eating, as the bartender told them they weren't wanted... he said that Native New Yorker is a "straight bar" and they weren't wanted there ever.Don't forget anything on the table, the staff will steal it! Hope the busser enjoys the new Oakley's! The 12 year old hostesses have trouble seating and communicating with guests! For a second I thought they were gonna pass me a note and make me check yes or no if a booth was ok! And don't address the manager about anything substantial, as long as his high school staff thinks he's a cool boss, his self esteem will be neutralized! A little adult interaction might do him good!I am a current resident here and would do anything to move right now. Shortly after we moved in our showers stopped working half of the time (no water coming out of shower head, loud noise you could hear outside...), along with a laundry list of items throughout the apartment that were damaged or not functioning properly (i.e. ceiling fan in living room that was broken). I have put in three maintenance requests, talked to the manager and even contacted corporate regarding this. I received the run around "It has been fixed," "It will be fixed in this week," "We did not see anything that needed to be fixed." Only when I contacted corporate did they actually act like they cared and came in to fix these issues after months and sent a plumbing crew to fix the showers. Since then, our showers are still having problems. Along with the maintenance issues, they will do anything to get your money and make your lease worth breaking. Unfortunately, I had to resign the lease and I am now being charges hundreds of dollars. I went in prior to my lease expiring to take care of the paperwork, which was not ready. They called me one day after saying everything was ready but since I did not sign by the due date I will incur late fees and an extra charge on my monthly rental charge. They do not mandate pool policy and the cops have been called multiple times for noise violations at night, teenagers fighting, people smoking/drinking during the day, small children unattended (as little as three years old)..you name it. This place is awful and if I would've known the problems beforehand, I would've gladly paid a bit more and moved into a complex that actually cared about their residents... or even acted like it. Not to mentions, there is NO parking at night!Ridiculous. I have had better fresher sushi from a supermarket. The place is overpriced and completely poor quality. Pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo. The service is a joke. It took forever to place an order, the woman next to us had to flag down a waitress to even get a drink order and she was there longer than us. The servers checked on us once after we received our food. We literally waited more than  20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back. 

The rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down. I am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi. The rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them. Each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi. I was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews. I just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience. I should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station, because at least they are honest about ripping me off.Last night, 1/17/09, my husband and I attended a birthday party for one of our friends at the Phoenix Rock Bottom location. While there, our service was terrible. We had to wait 45 minutes for our food to be ordered and we had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. The waitress took almost a half hour to bring our check to us after we asked for it. 

By the next morning, I looked at my bank account to find that they had charged us for our meal twice and the second charge was for 4 times the cost of the actual meal. After calling to speak to the manager today, I was told that the money was not taken out of our account yet. He acted as if this there was really no reason to be concerned. He then told me that he would call me back later. After 4 hours, I had not heard from him, so I called again to be told that he would call me when he was not busy.

I understand that mistakes happen, but I expect that they be remedied immediately and with a gracious attitude. At this point, my husband and I will not be returning to your company and we will be sure to let our friends know about this if the mistake is not at least reimbursed to us within 24 hours.Stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly And seated very quickly. My waiter was awesome, took our order, got the drinks out and brought us the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa?!?  

The salsa looked and tasted like it was 90% tomato paste, 5% chopped veggies, 5% liquid.  The salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless. I inquired about the flavor and texture and he mentioned they recently changed the recipe. He asked if we'd like to try the spicier salsa, said it might be better. 

The spicier salsa was brought out and it wasn't much better. Instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle BBQ sauce. 

The food was super quick coming out which was awesome, however the awesome ended there.  The chicken tortilla soup was more like a salty stew, the trio enchilada plate looked good but the rice was mushy and flavorless, the cheese in top if the Baja sauce was dried out and the pork was chewy and included pieces of fat and tendon. About the best thing in that plate was the black beans 

The carnitas chimmy was so so, the meat was flavorless like it was boiled. 

The chicken in the chicken cilantro lime Caesar salad tasted like it was boiled then lightly grilled.  The lettuce and dressing were pretty good though. 

The tamale bites tasted like deep fried Mac and cheese bite with green chili in them. 

We have our waiter out feedback and again he mentioned the kitchen changed the menu and recipes. We asked for the manager and Maria came out and we gave her the same feedback. She too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes. She apologized for the quality and taste if the food and comp'd half if the meals. 

I understand adding new things to the menu to stay current but why change recipes?  

The 1 star given was only because of the great service and attitude of our waiter and manager.  Can't say I'll be back again, at least not until they fix the recipes and go back to using quality ingredients and improve in their food qualities.Waited for 10 minutes to be told there was a sign up list in the corner about 20 feet away in the opposite direction. After another 30 minutes of waiting some lady walked up that was NOT on the list, said she was here about 30 mins (I'm at 40 mins now) and the guy started helping her for her sons prom. What is the point of the list again?Seven of us took my daughter there for her birthday. The service was incredibly slow. Over three hours for food we cooked at the table!  The food quality seemed ok but the bill was over $500 and only two alcoholic drinks were served. When we left my 28 year old son wanted to stop and grab a burger. He is not overweight in the slightest and there was not enough food for him. After talking to the remaining guests everyone felt that way. I'll never be back. I'd rather spend $700 at a better restaurant.Ordered flatiron steak first time charred to a crisp .. Sent back came back raw in the centerHigh prices, poor selection, and awful customer service. These are the reasons I chose not to register at Babies R Us in the first place. When l received BRU products at my shower and had no use for them I tried returning to the store. I did not have a gift receipt nor a gift registry so I was told they couldn't do anything for me. I was stuck with products I didn't need. Really? Is this how you treat your customers? The cashier admitted that each item was currently on the shelves but she had no way of "matching them up" against a receipt or registry. She even suggested that I try returning them to Walmart because their return policy is very lax. I was disgusted and offended. I was doing the right thing by taking the products back to the store from which they came. Even Target allows you to return things without a receipt. I'll never buy anything at BRU.I don't if there is way to give 0 start to this particular macarono grill location, before ordering Mushroom Ravioli, I asked waitress if this is totally vegetarian, she said yes. When she served, there was a big peice of chicken on top of it, i asked her what is it ? she say's it's just a big piece of rvaioli, i looked carefully with a fork, and it was chichken, she took it back, and brought a fresh one, and it tasted horrible.

I saw manager roaming around here and there, but he looked totally useless, no one came to apologize to us....

Waitress asked if we wanted more bread, we said yes, and that bread never came.....

I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THIS MACARONI GRILL LOCATION, TOTAL RIP OFFYou can get a better cake at Safeway for half the price (and I am not really a big fan of Safeway cake, but you get my point).  This place is a joke - don't believe the hype. Stay away from the overly-sugary nasty baked thing that does not deserve to be called 'cake'. Don't eat the free tasters, don't fall for the packaging and the fancy looking bakery. If you are this desperate for cake, seriously, just go to Safeway.Yuck, really?

I never go to Best Buy, but I went over the weekend to try some laptop comparison shopping with my wife. I just wanted to her try different models and see which ones she liked.

First, what are you doing at the door, Guy Standing At The Door? Are you a receipt checker? I can't stand that kind of gestapo B.S. If you are a greeter, and you did greet us, why are you standing at a podium, Richard Dawson?

Onward. They have the laptops arranged by brand... kind of? There are a couple laptops of each brand, but then they have endcaps of laptops or no known reason, and a whole row of "student" laptops for which the criteria is anyone's guess. The "Apple" section is also segregated 20 feet away with curtains, as if to prevent an infiltration of filth from the Windows PCs. 

My wife managed to inspect a couple of the laptops for at least 30 seconds before being jostled aside by an associate trying to get into a storage cage. I marveled at the signs advertising the Geek Squad service of essentially turning on your laptop and uninstalling a couple unwanted apps for like $100. How many people have been suckered into this, I wonder.

Then... there is a Cox Cable guy roaming around? Why am I being accosted by a third-party vendor inside of Best Buy?This is the only Best Buy that I have a hard time doing business with locally. I bought a computer that was too slow to run my software. Was too busy to take it back within 14 days of return because I thought a ram upgrade might have been the problem. (had to wait for the ram to arrive.) I took it back on the 15th day and the manager on duty seemed to take joy in pointing out the small print on my receipt and washed his hands of me. (I took it back to another store and explained what happened and they apologized and took it back on exchange. So Best Buy Signal Butte, Mesa good job at basic customer service I agree it sucks to return a product I hated it got recommended by another store.)

Later looked at car stereos 4 times without being greeted once. No sale bought down the street. 

In the appliance department I DID get help and the salesman said that my warranty is no good if I don't buy upgraded hoses and was really stuck on Samsung after I told him I wanted an American brand. No sale bought down the street.

I read recently that Best Buy is concerned about "Showrooming" for the internet so people can experience and then purchase online. 

I heard my appliance sales guy say to me. "We are not on commission" which I assume means that he can be trusted to not recommend based on what makes him more money. I wish he did make more. Then maybe I could see the same guy on different visits.

It is my opinion that not paying the salespeople an adult living wage causes the good ones to move on and no relationship is continued after it is made.

This is the real problem. No relationship, no profit. You always have to pay to advertise that person back into your store. Nobody can survive this way of doing business.

Please Please be better.. I am running out of options to see my electronics in person. 
RIP Circuit City and Ultimate.My consultant was Debbie. She brought me about six dresses and then she disappeared for the rest of the time we were there. I'm assuming this happened because I said that I wasn't sure I was buying anything quite yet, therefore she wouldn't get a sale. Regardless of if you are buying a dress or not, you should get the one on one attention. Anyway, my mom had to assist me in and out of all the dresses and figure out how to pin them to fit me the right way. She never once came back to retrieve the dresses and my mom had to clear out the dressing room in order for there to be room again. My aunt had to go searching for more dresses for me to try on. Also, the overall ambience of the store is completely outdated. Pink walls and mint green carpet with stains on it is not a pleasant aesthetic to any room. The bathroom was disgusting and the soap was out so we had to use hand sanitizer instead. I went to a different bridal shop after this and my experience was completely opposite making me realize just have awful my experience at David's bridal was. DO NOT GO HERE.I went to this store to return some scrapbooking supplies. I wasn't sure if only one cashier accepted returns, so I had to interrupt the cashier at customer service. I felt terrible for doing it, as I know it is terribly rude, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't falling into a line I didn't need to. After saying excuse me, the cashier did not answer nor acknowledge my presence, so I said, "excuse me" a little louder and I get a cold "hold on Ma'am." I'm terribly sorry you are busy and I interrupted you, but a simple acknowledgement in your facial expression would have sufficed. 

The part that really irked me was while she was scanning my many items, she made a comment, "you did KEEP some things, right?!" Excuse me? I just went to Michael's and returned $40 worth of scrapbooking supplies in which I had originally spent $50 and I did not hear a single peep from their cashier. I still ended up spending $70 at Jo Ann's with my return. I completely understand and I absolutely hate to do it, but you have a return policy that could easily state that scrapbook supplies are excluded. They are tiny items and I'm sure are a pain to re-stock, but your corporation does not say that I cannot return my unused scrapbooking supplies. On top of that, you are located within a 1 mile radius of TWO other art supply stores, I'm sure it happens. 

I have dealt with difficult customers all of my life and never once let my emotions or aggravation show, especially a sassy remark like that. So, to my cashier, Barbara Ann, your attitude just cost you a customer. I will not be giving Jo Ann Fabrics any of my business.Ra Ra Sis Boom Blah.. Ive tried so many times to eat here and like it since there aren't  really any other sushi restaurants nearby.  Its just not happening. Sure they have a great happy hour prices, but I don't think I should have to fish lemon seeds out of my sake bottle, or have little nats swimming around in my soy sauce. The sushi wasn't very fresh at all. This would be a great place to go if you've never eaten sushi before, so then you'd have nothing to compare it to.Went to Phoenix for my buddy's Rock and Roll Marathon, and on the day we were heading back to LA we decided to grab some sushi since it seemed to be on everyone's mind. Found that there was a RA sushi bar right near the place we were staying at, and so what I thought was going to be a decent sushi place; since we have one back in CA ended up turning into a horrible experience. To be honest the only good thing I remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea...lol...I mean the service took forever (which btw it was around 3 pm and no one was in the restaurant), so either we had some beginner sushi chef learning the ropes or they just decided to take there sweet ass time. If it weren't for the eye candy and the green tea I wouldn't be able to give it any stars, but I decided to be nice and at least give them a star for effort. Have fun for whoever decides to try out this place. Never going back that's for sure. =PThe only salon after 15 years in Ahwatukee that has given me a nail infection. For instance, if you get gel nails, they put your hands right on the dirty UV machines, with no towel.Food was poor. Nachos were burnt. Waited 50 minutes for check. 1 star is generous. Not sure but I think the ribs were coyote.Employees complaining about you for a custom order when you drive up, take over 8 minutes to bring it, act offended again when you tell them that they got the order wrong, and then hesitate to correct the problem. The sad part is we have run I to similar problems with this location several times.Dropped by today to go get a drink. I've had iffy experiences here before, but I decided to go anyway. 

I walked in with a buddy of mine. He got some candy, and I asked how much it was for a can of Coke. The owner yelled at me and said, "You come here all the time for 3 years and never buy anything!" The thing is, I would come here about 2 times a week to buy a drink. This man has no right to say that I never buy anything from there. 

I was shocked. I never knew someone could ever be so rude running a business. I asked him again, how much was a can of a Coke. He tells me that it was $.75 cents. WHAT? $.75 no big deal, but its thr fact that he LIED to me that got me mad. Every time I came here, they were always $.50, so how come it randomly got marked up to $.75?? 

Usually I wouldn't mind paying an extra $.25. But the fact that the owner lied to me and yelled at me really for no reason, I doubt I'll ever be coming back again.

Terrible customer service, so, so rude. Too bad there isn't 0 stars.So, I visited this LA Fitness on a guest pass, to see how I liked the facility. Thank God I never paid anything to go there. 

When I showed my guest pass, I had to present it to a young kid sitting at a desk who said he'd take my driver's license that day, as an exchange and I'd just have to get it from him when I was done with my class. I thought it was weird that I didn't actually get an official pass, but whatever. 

So, I return the next day and of course, it was an issue. Not only that the GM basically reprimanded me for something his own worker failed to do AND called me a liar. When I produced my guest pass on my phone, he annoyingly tossed it back at me. When he asked why I didn't have a membership already, I told him that I kinda work at a fitness studio. He insulted my place of work by saying, he had never heard of it. Obviously, he hasn't it's a women's only dance studio. Then he preceded to pitch me membership options and tell me about his son that is going to be a big rapper. Really? I never returned to finish my 9 days left of my guest pass, even that wasn't worth it. 

Just the fact that LA Fitness employs complete degenerates to run one of their locations doesn't bode well for the company itself. And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed, well, I'm not sure I trust LA Fitness at all.

As for the 2 classes that I took, they were ok but the mats that they provide are ridiculous - they're clearly not cleaned and most of them are ripped apart.Stopped by to get membership options, and ended up walking out after waiting almost 30 minutes without being seen?  Hard to believe there wasn't a single employee there who could take 10 minutes to give us a tour of the place.  After reading the Yelp, Google, and Foursquare reviews on how poor the customer service is, I'm glad we didn't wait.  Will end up going with YMCA or Gold's, both of which had much better customer service up front.Waffle House . . . food is good - consistant and good.

Cook was awesome, she was able to put a quality product out to her best.  Kudos to ' Alice ' ;)

Service was weak . . . shameful.  Only one server and he was overwhelmed.  Ok - Friday evening ( 8 pm ish ) and I can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but NEVER cut corners where it counts.  Service is one area that will break a restaurant or more important bring people back.  ( food of course is the other ) 

One server was unable to get the orders correct, product out to the customers nor clean up.  Given that the cook was doing her job . . . the person taking / putting in and delivery of said orders was the weak link here.  He was overwhelmed with having the entire floor to himself.

I will not go back to this Waffle House again.

Sorry, the management is to blame and since they don't care, why should I return.The only positive and knowledgeable person at this store is Chris (male) not the female Manager Chris. I truly wonder how this location survives due to all the inconsistencies an lack of communication. I had to file a claim due to their lack of properly packaging my gift item and now a month later its still no where. I will now start to using the Ray Road location. STAY AWARE FROM CHANDLER LOCATION! Chris (male) transfer to a different location it will benefit you tremendously!!!Aweful! Waited 30 Mins for food and that is with hardly anybody there.This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mailI ordered an item that was listed for $3.69 on the menu but was rung up for $3.99 on the screen. 

When I advised the person taking my order about the discrepancy he firmly and rudely said that he could not change the pricing on the system which was set up by corporate.  

I gently advised him that this would not be honoring the posted price and asked to speak to his manager, the gentleman advised me that he was the manager.     I drove up and spoke to 'Quenten' who had the title of "Shift Leader" on his badge.    He gave me the store number and advised me that his boss Sandy would be in on Tuesday.   When I advised him that I wanted to address this manner sooner he told me that he was only doing what he was told before he gave me the name of his district manager and we wished each other a good night. 

This is the first time I have ever experienced an issue at any Taco Bell Resturant and I suppose that perhaps it would be a tad lofty to think that certain individuals may care about the big picture as a drive thru employee.   However, I do find it that it is a resturant's duty to charge the posted price and/or post the correct price to prevent any misunderstandings.   In summary be on the lookout for pricing discrepancies when at this Taco Bell restaurant.Disappointed in my experience in Discount Tire over the Labor Day weekend.  Bought 4 new tires and left the car with them.  Took them over 2.5hrs to put the tires on the car, which is longer than I have experienced in past visits.
Got the car back in the late afternoon and drove it around for a bit.  The next morning I come out and TWO tires are completely flat.  I fill them back up and can hear the air leaking out of the value stem, which is usually due to faulty installation.  Of course these guys are never open on Sunday and Monday is a holiday.  So I'm stuck without my car for 2 days.  Maybe they will make it right, but pretty much ruined my long weekend.Used to eat here frequently.

Went in last night and my son pointed out a roach in the soda fountain.

Last trip here. My wife about freaked.

Health department verified the roaches living under the soda fountain, and in the employee room in back.

They sprayed later that day supposedly.After tonight, f--- del taco! First of all, the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat.. After buying my meal, i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair! So i call the location about 3-4 times, no voicemail available or anything, probably shaving someone's head for the next person who orders some food.. I will never go to this place againI just moved here and found the perfect nail place...but it's 20 minutes away and I needed something close today so I tried this place. There are a couple other places close by but I decided to try this place. 

Got a manicure and a pedicure today. 

The employees were friendly. 

However, the pedicure chairs are very old and absolutely the lowest quality chairs I have ever seen in a salon. 

During the manicure I noticed that the station had layers of grime all over the lamp and other things and was extremely gross. There were also what appeared to be two small pubic hairs sitting in top of the lotion bottle. 

I asked for my nails to be buffed rather than having clear-coat applied;  she didn't tell me they charge $5 to buff although the clear-coat was free....found that out at the register. 

Anyway...go across the street to the nail salon next to Starbucks rather than this place. 

I will not make the mistake of going here again.I would like to give Desert Ridge Cleaners 0 stars.  This is by far the worst cleaners I've ever been to and I've been to many cleaners in many cities.  I choose this cleaners because it is 2 minutes away from my house and what a mistake that was!  Not only is it extremely expensive, but the tailor screwed up my alterations.  I brought in a pair of white pants to be hemmed with the original bottoms.  The tailor nodded like he understood, but it was hard to tell as he doesn't speak English too well.  When I picked up my pants I noticed that you could see the hem right through the pants.  I have never seen this before before and I get all my pants hemmed.  He basically folded the cuff under to "hem" the pants and sewed the part inside the pants - it looked like a 4 year old did it.  I was outraged and asked him to fix it.  I came back a few hours later and he fixed it which made me think he just did a terrible job because of laziness.

Don't go here - they are rude and do a horrible job.Worst dry cleaners in the valley! They lost a pair of pants and then acted as if they did me a favor for finding them. No apology from the manager when I picked them up the next day. Quite frankly for what they charge, one would think they would offer superior customer service and a quicker turn around time than the $2.50 dry cleaners. I will never use Desert Ridge Cleaners again.I wish I could give 0 star to this terrible Verizon store. One star is even too much. This is the worst experience I have ever had with any company. The rep was 1000 times worse than car salesmen Seriously, take my word for it and don't do any business with them.The first time we went to Rock Bottom (how fitting a name), the hostess sat us next to a table with three screaming kids right next to where the servers enter and exit the kitchen. The waiter came by after a few minutes, took our drink order and then actually snatched the menus out of hands. He brought us our drinks and promptly walked away. The floor manager came by and we told her what happened. She reprimanded the waiter in front of us and gave us two discount cards for our next visit and comped our beers. The food wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination. So little so that I don't remember what we ordered.

We decided to use our discount cards for a second trip. We were sat once again in a far corner by the kitchen. The waiter took our drink order and food order together and instead of bringing out our drinks and then our food, just waited until our food was done cooking to bring out the drinks as well. I ordered the lobster enchiladas which was about $18 (US) because on the menu it sounded tasty. On the plate it looked like a used deflated diaper. The enchiladas were TINY. I asked the waiter if that was what it was supposed to look like because it didn't look like $18 worth of food. The chef that made it came out with an attitude and said, "You should have asked about the portion before we wasted all that lobster." To which I responded, "What lobster? There isn't a lobster tank in here which means you pulled it from a can." I have never been treated so rudely. The floor manager apologized however refused to defuse our anger because the previous manager comped our beers and gave us $20 off our next meal which he felt was more than kind enough a gesture.

So if you want Rock Bottom quality food with Rock Bottom service at sky high prices then this is your stop. For those of you who read this review this far: NOT A WORD OF THIS HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED. We are never coming back here.
Right across the parking lot are better places with better food on similar menus, The Keg, BJ's, and Wolfley's.Signed up for yelp, just to post this. Wish i could give negative stars. Worst service ever!!! Day after Christmas, my stepdaughter and I both needed to do an exchange, she needed a larger size and i needed a different color. They were sold out of both, so we requested to make an equal exchange. Since these were gifts, we did not have receipt, tags are still on. We were told no receipt--no store credit and no exchange. Not everyone gives the receipt when sending christmas presents. The sales clerk said "Oh well". Really? That's how you treat customers. I have shopped here almost 20 years and will never ever go there again!!!!The food is good, but the service isn't. Weekend mornings are a nightmare here, also they frequently run out of things.Do not go for a car wash or a oil change. I went twice to give them a second chance. I have never gone to a car wash with such awful service my 8 year old has done a better job washing my car. I don't even know why I tipped them shame on me! I asked them to replace my air filter twice and they still couldn't get it right. I don't know how they stay in business. They kept pushing me to add all these extras. So pushy. Save you money go else where.Wow... the customer service is horrible. Service adviser Ted was very friendly at first until I turned down his $400 quote on a basic $90 brake service. Brakes ended up squealing  afterwards. It took a trip to the dealership to fix the problem.We had a pleasant time for Aloha here on Monday so we  attempted to have dinner here on Christmas eve. 

The maitre d said we would be seated in 15 minutes or less. We waited a good 25 minutes before she informed us the table had not been setup yet and she could only seat us outside or wait longer. 

OMG! Sorry young lady, located  at the JW Marriott which has several dinning options we got up and walked out! Maybe this is one of reasons why they have closed down the Scottsdale location!Worst birthday experience of my life. 
There were eight of us who came from the resort pool to the patio for Aloha Hour, then dinner. First we were told that the patio was closed (on what had to have been the most gorgeous evening of the summer.) That's fine. Inside, it's a little too fancy for our pool-wear, although all but one of us had coverups. So we are decoding what to do, when a server tells us we are dressed inappropriately. We say that we know...we were going to eat on the patio and now we are just standing there deciding what to do (ps the restaurant is completely empty except for about five servers who are glaring at us.) 
We go back outside where my elderly father needs to sit down for a moment. Normally after a chilly reception like that I would have left immediately, but my dad can't walk very far, the rest of the party is hungry, and we had really been looking forward to Roy's. 
The server comes outside where we are standing (except for my dad who had to sit down) and confronts us. I explain that its my birthday, that we have been loyal Roy's customers in Hawaii and here, and that we just want to have a nice meal.  I explained that we weren't trying to offend anyone and that there really aren't any other customers to offend right now any way. She tells me that I'm being rude and that she is letting us know about the dress code because she doesn't want her manager to see us and come confront us (so instead she does the honors, I guess.) I am so astounded by how outright MEAN this woman is. It baffling. She looks like she's early 50's or so...you think she would know how to handle a dress code concern better. 
So the manager comes out, tries to smooth things over, tells us we're all dressed just fine except for one of our well-behaved kids, who needs a shirt with sleeves. Reminds us that there's a sign that says that too (expert managers always point to the policy) Tells us that we won't have that woman as our server. She'll give us "Debbie, who is fantastic like me." Okay. Ha ha. Come in. 
We get $100+ worth of appetizers and drinks because the full menu is not available yet. Debbie the server is fine. We watch the sun go down through the window. The only good thing about sitting inside is the fantastic live music by Jared Blackstone.  There is also a a very nice server named Tanner, who had brought my dad some water while we were standing on the patio. He comes over and apologizes to us because he has witnessed this whole thing. He's a class act. Kudos to him and I hope he can get a job at an establishment that values service as much as he does. 
The manager never came back by our table. We didn't stay for dinner. Instead we walked across the resort to The Blue Sage, where we enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a  gorgeous night. 
The experience at Roy's was one of the all-time worst I have ever experienced in my life.Between the two of us my mom and I have 5 dogs who need to be groomed regularly. We have used this Petco to do this for some time now. I was hesitant to return to them after my dog was burned by their clippers (if they are used too long they get hot, need a spray to cool them down typically) however, my mom convinced me otherwise and for a while they did a pretty good job. 

Unfortunately, this last time we used this will be the last time. I would not step foot in that store again. My mom dropped our dogs off at around 10 and the groomer said it would be about 5 hours (sounds about right, and hour per dog), at around 2, I believe, my mom received a call asking a question about one of the dog's cuts and it was then she was informed that there was one dog left and he should be done in an hour or so. At around 6 pm we were a little worried and decided to go check on our pups. 

When we got there there was absolutely NO ONE in the grooming salon. The lights were even off! We had to walk out into the actual store to find someone to help us. That woman was very helpful, however they couldn't find the groomer!!!! Took them about 10 minutes to find her. Meanwhile we demanded our dogs back so they could go potty! Poor things were in there for 8 hours, and the staff cannot walk them. They finally found the groomer and turns out my 90 pound Goldendoodle STILL  had not been groomed!!!!! So we waited while the groomer and the manager went at poor Teddy with two sets of clippers. My Yorkie still needed his "finishing touches" as well, however, since he is 16 years old I did not have the heart to put him through that again. 

I guess they were understaffed that day, however they shouldn't have taken that appointment if they couldn't handle it! The dogs who were actually done had patchy cuts and their nails weren't clipped either.  Worst part..... We still had to pay for most of it! We will be using another groomer, rest assured.arrogant, unprofessional, disinterested sales people.  We were treated poorly on 3 consecutive visits - basically treated as if we should be extremely humbled and grateful that they'd deign to sell us an Audi.  We didn't buy one - went across the street to Mercedes.  Far better service and professionalism.No one here knows anything. Friend registered here and just had the worst experiences ever. Crib arrived broken and had to be reordered. Everything she registered for wasn't in stock and every employee doesn't know anything cause they disappear to find one that does. Every time I'm with her it's so frustrating. I would never Come back.How can you mess up a franchise? This Sonic will show you how!  I live within walking distance and have been there way too many times out of sheer laziness and every time I get what I deserve for stupidly going back.  You have about a 10% chance of the stoned teen on guard (they're rotated out weekly it seems) getting your order right and then you get to spend 10 minutes trying to correct it with them and another 10 with the disgruntled manager dragged over after much head scratching.  Honestly out of the two dozen times I've been there they got my order right once, i actually went home, did a little dance and bought a lottery ticket that night.So far agree with the customer service. These guys should go find another job.My family paid a ridiculous amount of money to take me to Dobsons Restaurant.      for the Mothers Day  brunch. The service was terrible, not much of a food selection. The prime rib was tasty but it was so thin you could see through it. The kids liked the chocolate fountain but then what kid 
doesn't like that. Just when we thought it couldn't get worse, we spotted a dead cockroach on the floor. Oh...but the Mothers in the group were presented with a limp, wilted rose on our way out. We definitely won't be back....ever!Came here for Mother's Day brunch at Dobson's Restaurant. Our waitress was the worst. She did things like not bring cream for coffee when kindly asked.. I had to get up, and go grab coffee creamer for my mom at their beverage station. My wife ordered french toast and specifically asked for whipped cream to be excluded from the order. Ya.. whipped cream all over. She was nowhere to be found most of the time, but when she was around, the bitch was fucking something up.

Food was weak. Totally not worth the 30 bones per person for buffet. Milk and OJ are extra.. Prime Rib, Eggs Benny, and Salmon Wellington were the main foods. None were good. Nothing I ate made me say, "This is why they charge 30 bucks." Everything I ate made me say, "I wish we had gone somewhere else." I shelled out 100 dollars for 3 people to eat shitty food, and experience shitty service.

My wife pointed out a dead cockroach as we were about to leave. Yuck.

Fuck this place. Do not eat here. I want my 100 dollars, and 2 hours back.My daughter and her friends went here a few nights ago. The sandwiches were awesome, until one girl found a piece of chewed gum in her sandwich. Also there were hairs in the sandwiches from the guy who made them. DISGUSTINGWe were on our way to China Magic Noodle and drove by this place so we decided to check it out.  Big mistake.

Not sure what restaurant the other Yelpers ate in but it sounds like a different place.

Our experience: bad neighborhood, creepy clientele, unfriendly owner, AC that was either malfunctioning or turned off, absolutely no atmosphere of any kind and really, really sub-par food.  We had a bowl of curry ramen that the owner couldn't even bother to mix the curry into.  No meat or vegetables at all.  Just ramen and a lump of curry paste.  And then a curry katsu don that was quite possibly the worst I've ever had

There was no greeting, no smile and no attempt to communicate. My wife's awful ramen came out a good 5 minutes before my katsu.  When my food finally did come out, the owner simply dumped the tray on the table (they don't bother taking it off the cafeteria tray), spilling miso soup all over my napkin.  No "Sorry" or offer to replace the napkin (no napkins on the table despite the fast food type setting).

Just really surly, unfriendly service. (Perhaps he'd have a better attitude if he turned the air on - it was 108 when we were there.) One of the other customers asked for wasabi and the owner said - I'm not kidding - "It's not free you know!" 

Really just a very sad attempt at food that isn't really that complicated in the first place and the owner's extremely bad attitude made the whole experience kind of insulting.  The owner appears openly contemptuous of both the food and the customers and who needs that?  Even it if were good, which it emphatically was not.

I'd rather eat anything than this crap.  There are a half-dozen other restaurants within a mile of here that are terrific.  Avoid this place.Not a good nail salon.  Staff talk Vietnamese to each other and not sure if they are talking about customers.  Quality of work very poor - manicures don't last and some of the staff doesn't know how to shape nails properly.  Got nail infection last visit - will never return.Time warp banking. Very low tech. Like banking in the early '70s. Ditched their checking account, but kept the Visa Credi Card. 
The free checking was nice because it would refund the fees that other banks charge for using their ATMs. But the customer has to do all the work by saving the receipts and mailing to Birmingham, AL. Other banks offer this but the computer system keeps track and automatically rebates the fees at the end if the cycle. If you complain about it the just say "This is the way we do it"I used to stay here for about ten years in a row to see Cubs Spring Training games from 1999-2009. I never had a complaint. It was well run. The hotel is no longer under the management of Best Western, and the quality of the experience has left very little to be desired. At check-in I was greeted by two college aged girls (one of whom was extremely rude to me). That night I heard a domestic disturbance between a couple in the next room. I called the front desk and told them about the situation. Someone came to their door and they temporarily quieted down. The disturbance began again around 3am, and eventually they either got too drunk or tired to fight anymore. I told the front desk in the morning that I would like my first night's stay comped and I would like to speak to a manager. A newer college-aged girl told me that there was no manager on duty and she had no way of contacting one. I came back an hour later, completely unsatisfied and talked with a manager. I told him that his employee had said there wouldn't be a manager in until Monday, and that nothing could be done about the situation in the room next door. He said that he could not help me either, and offered to move my room. That's what I settled on, but I will definitely not be going back there. It's a real shame that this place where I've had some great times has really gone south.Beware. 

I wouldn't stay here until they deal with their bed bug problem. When we had to change rooms because of the multiple ones we found on our bed next to our sleeping baby, reception seemed fairly unconcerned.I confess. I thought that the negative reviews could be "overly harsh" or somehow, just plain wrong. And for that, I apologize.

Not one bird there seemed to be well-adjusted pet material. Flocks of  smaller birds (read quakers, conures) were in 50? gallon aquariums. Maybe smaller. None of them seemed used to being handled. The large birds that were out of their cages all showed signs of distress - only about 1/3 of the birds had any of their long tailfeathers, about 1/2 showed obvious signs of feather plucking in the form of bare patches across back or chest. In the back were amazons, african greys, and other parrots of similar size in birds in cages I MIGHT have temporarily put budgies in. I didn't have the heart to look at them all.

Their selection of food, overpriced toys, and other accessories was better than the average pet store, but how can I justify spending money here? I'm looking elsewhere. Ugh.Bottom line: Cage World is selling rescue birds at pet prices. 

There is no other way to describe it. They have a large number of birds for sale. But, most are behaviorally challenged and euphemistically referred to as "consignments." The truth is, the majority are poorly socialized and would be better described as "rescues." Normally, such birds are rehomed for nominal fees to encourage placement. Cage World is simply profiting from what are severely challenged birds.

The worst part of this is: Cage World makes little effort to socialize these birds. Employees are usually found sitting in the back office surfing the web. While the store is full of poorly-socialized "rescue" birds sitting in cages heartbreakingly small and filthy. These birds often see no human interaction for days. Once or twice a day, an employee (usually unskilled help who is afraid to put their hand in most cages) will change the water and food bowls. But, for most of the day, employees are glued to the computer like they have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Rescuing animals is noble. I have sympathy for rescuers who get in over their heads and can't keep up (trying to "save just one more"). But, that's not the case at Cage World. Instead of charging a nominal "rehoming fee" (20% of pet prices) to encourage placement of problem birds with people who can donate time, they charge 60-80% of pet prices. Worse: employees act like they don't care. I'm always stunned to see them scurrying to their computers. If they're in the business of placing rescue (special-needs) birds, you'd think they would scurry to those birds and work with them every chance they get. Instead, the computer is a bigger attraction.The French fries were so soggy you could use them as shoe laces , also portions were undersized not one of the containers were full to the top , not that any of us wanted to eat themLast week we were driving home from work very hungry at 4:30pm and wanted to try somewhere we hadn't been in a while. My fiancé said he used to eat at the Coco's in Chandler frequently before they closed and suggested this. Upon entering the restaurant I had a bad feeling. The interior was severely dated and decked out in hideous shades of orange from the late 70's early 80's. The windows carpet and booths could have all used a good cleaning. We sat down and looked over the menu and decided to keep it simple. My fiance' ordered the Chopped Steak dinner entrée (well done with no pink) and I went with a Prime Rib Mushroom Cheeseburger  (some pink). We received our beverages quickly which was welcomed on a hot day and waited for our food. And waited, and waited...45 minutes later after asking our waitress twice where our meals were she proudly brought them out. It was immediately clear we had made a huge mistake. My burger went back immediately because at first glance it was obvious I had not been served the burger I ordered. No thinly sliced prime rib and no mushrooms. The burger bun was stale and the burger itself was a cold severely overcooked frozen thin hockey puck. I was immediately promised it would be replaced and it was whisked off back to the kitchen. I then looked at my fiancé's Chopped Steak dinner and saw it consisted of the same thin 1/4lb hockey puck also severely overcooked with a scoop of masked potatoes beside it and GRAY Gravy slathered all over it. The waitress had disappeared (never to come to our table again and refill drinks) and four minutes later the manager arrived with my "correct" burger. The same burger and fries I was originally served was put in front of me and when I complained he said "I took it back and had the sliced prime rib and mushrooms added!" It was still cold, still overcooked, and had lettuce and condiments on it that did not belong! I demanded it go back and be taken off our bill and after seeing my fiancé's dinner opted not to eat at all. When we questioned the manager about the "Chopped Steak" he said they had been serving the same 1/4lb hamburger patty as their "Chopped Steak" since he began working for the restaurant. He took care of our entire bill and even offered a gift card to have us come back but we declined because if that was their standard fare we certainly were not coming back again. The pie's in the front case looked appetizing but this is not the Coco's food of old and I certainly would not even chance those. There are too many other excellent choices for dinner and dessert at restaurants within a mile.I was a long time customer of Ski Pro and having made purchases at all locations several times. I thought of myself as having some brand loyalty...at least when it comes to local retail purchasing.  I do look online if it doesn't require holding or fitting. 

However, the last purchase I will ever make from Ski Pro was last summer.  I bought a Ronix ski rope handle.  This was one of their nicest and most expensive models, priced over $120. At checkout I was told about their 2 week return policy.  

The following weekend we went to the lake.  After 2 or 3 runs, I noticed it was already coming apart.  Not just in one location either.  The rubber grip was tattered already in two different places, the seams were falling apart, and the clear coating was flaking.  

It never touched anything other than water.  Not the board, swim deck, boat, or anything. Literally, about 3 hours of use by two very experienced riders.  

The next weekend, 11 days after the purchase, I returned to the store to exchange the rope for a different one and was basically told to "F off".  

The 17 year-old stoner behind the counter said they couldn't return the item.  I wasn't even looking for my money back, I just wanted an in-store credit to buy a different handle.  The answer was still no.  

His position was that they can't take back the product because it had been used.  Yet he couldn't explain why they allow returns on all other ski accessories which I've purchased mass amounts of over the last 7 year.  I've even returned a wake board I bought from Ski Pro after taking to Lake Powell for a week!  Back then (2002ish) Susan, the owner, ran the Camelback location and had a better grip on things. 

So anyhow, I asked the clerk how I would've know the product was faulty unless we used it.  He shrugged his shoulders and said "sorry dude, you own it now".   

Apparently, the two week policy is only for unused items.  I asked how they assess if something's been used (given that I've returned numerous items and admitted they were used) i.e. boots that were pinching, shades don't fit right, board not aggressive enough, etc.  
He stated "it's a case by case basis".  I couldn't believe the product warranty and company return policy was being judged by a 17yr old kid and basing his decision on if an item looks used. He even said to me "if it looks used, how would we be able to sell it to anyone else?"  I asked him why they would sell a faulty product to someone else.  He shrugged.   

After about 4 minutes of him not being able to explain this ridiculous policy, I decided to leave the product with them in hopes they would reconsider their position and reminded him I would be happy to apply the amount to another handle. No dice.

That is the last time I'll ever shop there.  Period.I thought I did enough research before I had Lodi install my garage doors.  The sales part of it was pretty good. I guess i assumed too much ,  in thinking that my sales rep would at least try and match the door to the color of my entire house.... Installation was ok too....  although the auto door opener was mounted on the wall...and wired to the motor in a very "elementary " fashion to say the least....just sort of wrapped the wire around piping and draped across the ceiling.   No biggie. But I had problems with the keypad mounted outside...will not take the programming.  I had the repair rep out....  could not make it work ....he said it was a discontinued model, ( or something like that?)  He would look into it?  After hearing nothing I called back again...they want $85.00 for a service call?????  I explained the situation to the guy that answered....he said" $85.00 and we will come look at it.   No wonder they gave me a "good price" on the door opener that i bought?????  So NO outside keypad i guess.    I will NOT have them back !!!Today was 110 degrees so I decided to come here on my lunch for something to cool my tastebuds. Sushi!! I haven't had it in such a long time.

Jesus. This was the first time I've ever gagged while I was trying to eat sushi. Actually I'm going to make a list because there's just so many things that are wrong on so many levels. This review is based soley on sushi bar experience, i didn't try the teppanyaki.

1. Walking in, it smelled. I mean, it smelled like old, mothballs or mold growing. I almost walked out but had the guts to keep going.

2. No hostess around. Apparently they only have one waitress/hostess running Friday at Lunch time. A big no no. Chef Jimmy invited me to sit at the sushi bar.

3. I ordered #1, the 'Beef Teriyaki with Tempura' bento box, but instead of saying that mouthful,  I said "I'd like to order #1". Sushi chef Jimmy says, "Tempura?" I said, "Yes." 

Can you see where this miscommunication is leading to? Yup, my bento box was just Tempura, no beef. Sigh. I've also ordered a side of California rolls, Cucumber rolls, and Salmon Nigiri. So for his mistake, he insisted on comping the Salmon Nigiri.

4. The sushi that I mentioned above were awful. The rice in the Cucumber & California rolls were doughy and not fresh. I tried as hard as I could to keep chewing and swallow, but I swear I almost threw up in my mouth. What happened?! I didn't even touch the Salmon Nigiri since it seriously looked like someone smashed both pieces with their hands.. very old looking as well. 

5. The only reason this place gets a star is because Jimmy is nice and we had a great conversation. But I'm sorry, something is wrong with warm, super doughy and unpresentable sushi.

It's gonna take some serious convincing to come back here. My stomach turned over several times before I could finish writing this review.My wife and I have been members of the Gold's Gym in Gilbert, AZ Gym number: 0175 for going on a year.  I have to say that the gym has degraded quite a bit since we have joined.  The gym seems to have over enrolled to the point that there are not enough parking spaces during peak hours causing people to "create" parking spots.  The cardio equipment is dilapidated at best, when we first joined there were six elliptical trainers since then two were removed due to malfunction and the four that are left are barely running and a couple are not level.  I am currently in contact with Gold's Corporate to see if there is any way that I can cancel the rest of my contract so that I can join a gym with adequate and functional equipment.While I enjoyed actually working out at this gym, if you value your sanity and credit rating, never, ever, join Gold's Gym!  I cancelled my membership months ago and paid in full, but their collection agency will not stop harassing me!  Gold's and Swift collections work together to rip you off and ruin your credit. They have an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. Wish I had checked before I joined.I just had the worst movie night in my life. All the customers at the movie theater were high and jerks. They also seemed to be buddies with the employees. It could be since it was Wednesday they were also employees? None of the staff would address the constant interruptions. I have not gone to that theater for 10 years, and I never will again. It is a shame because the theater is nice, clean, and well kept.One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  First the stuffed shells they brought my friend and I were filled with a runny filling which resembled baby food.,we were both disgusted. Sent it back after two bites, and the portion (a large) is supposedly supposed to feed 4-6 "people", maybe those people come from lollipop land because it's small for $30 (maybe ten shells)... So we got the chicken parmisian instead. 6 peices of thin chicken breast for $30, no pasta with it... It was OK. Not great. Then when I commented negatively to the manager on our bill being $66 , after I had taken two bites of the shells, and half of a single chicken breast -- she was extremely rude, and condisending. I won't be back. Ever. This place is owned by planet Hollywood too, so if u like corporate dog food which you'll pay too much for, then go for it.This is my 3rd bad experience at this location. First we were there for a hour and no food, and the manager came to our table and gave us a coupon for our meal. The 2nd time one of our two steak was under cooked, so we paid for one and keep the coupon. The 3rd time again we had an under cooked steak and that's when the customer service was trouble. First the manager took half off my steak then after we complained they took the rest off. We tried to use the coupon to pay for the other steak, which was half of the coupon amount. They refused to give us another coupon for the remaining amount. So then we tried to use the remaining amount for a friends meal and they refused. Needless to say we will not going back to this location, because of the awful customer services. As a steakhouse, you would think they know how to cook a med steak.This place needs negative stars! The only good thing I have to say about it is that after argueing with the cashier, we finally got our money back and were able to go somewhere else to eat. Both my husband and I were not happy about the thought of paying $18 to leave still hungry.   I wanted to like New China, but the food was all cold, either tasteless or tasted spoiled, I couldn't find someone to get me water to drink and some things tasted spoiled.  I spit more food into napkins than I ate and finally, after going back to the buffet to try a few different items (all equally disappointing and spit into napkins) I went to the cashier and asked to speak to the manager.  she asked to see my receipt and then proceeded to argue that we'd been there for 20 min. and obviously had eaten something and claimed that in the 13 yrs of their business no one had ever complained! Seriously??? After showing her our plates with rejected food and napkins filled with garbage, reluctantly, she refunded our money.  My advice to diners is to go somewhere else. I should have read these yelp reviews before trying new restaurants.  We had a burger and fries at Five Guys..they never let us down!Food is not bad, but nothing great. My favorite is the Kaum Poong Key (garlic chicken). My biggest issue with this place is the customer service. I went in with the yoko club card which is their customer appreciation card. I was excited because with the current purchase I was going to have earned a free lunch. When I got there the lady ripped up my card and told me it was expired. She was so rude it makes me never want to eat there anymore. Their customer appreciation backfired on them.We decided to try this place for the first time today. First impression was great - the place looked real nice. 

Service was horrible! We waited for our drinks, we waited to order, we waited for our food, we waited for drink refills. We waited from entrance to food served - almost 40 minutes! My order wasn't complete, I had to ask for my toast. Someone else at our table also just got up and asked for refills. 

The food itself was okay. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. I thought my omelet had a bit too much cheese and the potatoes seemed almost tasteless. For the cost, I felt cheated.

Honestly, I will NOT go here again.Came here due to the good reviews but I was disappointed. My first impression upon walking in was the horrid chemical smell; it smelled like a nail salon and not a restaurant. The service was not friendly, barely got a verbal acknowledgement let alone a smile from our server. The sushi did not taste very good. Our server even tried to correct a party at another table who said that their order was wrong by bringing them the original ticket which actually showed that the party was right and the server had put in order wrong. Not very professional. There was not one thing that would make me want to return.Could this place be anymore crowded? I can't get down the aisles, due to crowding of staff, other customers running into me. One gigantic cluster fudge. I did end up buying Kale for my greek tortoise but that is everywhere so I won't be returning. Even then there is no order to checking out. Everyone just cuts in front of you and my God I couldn't get out of there fast enough.Horrible place! Do not take your pet to Dr Archuleta. I took my boxer here to be neutered and within 2 days his testicles started swelling. My husband took him back in and the vet blamed us. Said he was to active. He was gated in a 4ft by 5ft area. This is a full grown boxer. Noway was he too active! They gave an anti inflammatory but no antibiotic. Oh and if course they charged us for it! They next day they were even worse so we took him to our regular vet to find out he had an internal infection due to how rough and unsanitary Dr Archuleta was. In turn my poor baby had to have drain tubes put in to get rid of the infection. They might be low cost but in the long run it cost us 4 times what it should have and my baby shouldn't have had to go thru this! Supposedly they are suppose to care about animals but all they care about is their bottom line! If they did care they wouldn't be so rough and hurt them!! I did go back and let them know what my own vet had determined and Dr Archuleta wouldn't even come out to talk to me. The girl at the desk was as far as I got and she could of cared less. She was so rude! I will NEVER refer anyone to them. Not after they almost killed my baby!They should have an ad in the paper food employees that should say, "must have teeth." Seriously, if you're going to run the registers, wear your dentures!! And the food sucked! I couldn't get a good meal to save my life that day. Geez!Bottom line: questionable business practice

Their work is at best unreliable. I used to get basic service until I quickly realized that they neither vacuum the back seat, wipe back window nor does good job wiping interior when they do wipe. 

So I opted for Exterior only wash, which you drive your car through the machine yourself and at the end you get quick & rough hand drying. For $4 to $5 depending on the day, I thought it was a decent deal. 

Until, that is, I encounter a shady schemes some cashiers for the exterior wash were running. 2 different schemes I've seen:

1.The casher will charge for the exterior wash, never run it through the register. When you ask for a receipt, they'll give you old winkly receipt from the pile they have.  

2. The new and improved scheme: With exterior wash service, you can add tire dressing for $1.  But this time, the cashier said it's $1 extra to have the guy rough dry at the end of the wash, a service which has been always included in the exterior wash. So I thought, maybe they changed the policy and this was how exterior wash was charged. I paid $1 extra. The cashier did not put anything in register or gave me any receipt. 

At the end of the wash I asked the guy who was drying my car in the 100F heat, if it was extra now for him to dry. He said he dried all the cars that came through the machine no matter what. I went ahead and tipped him only because i knew he was not part of this scheme and he was sweating like a fountain. 

I took their survey online explaining the situation, did I hear anything from the corporate office? NO. 

I kept going back there even when I was aware of scheme #1, but when they tricked me with scheme #2, I had enough. 

I understand car wash is not the cleanest business, but this is too shady for me. I will NEVER go to any full circle car wash again.I ate here once for a retirement dinner for a friend, and once was enough.

The place was nasty dirty, the tables (that you eat on....) were the worst.

The pizza was pretty bad ( Eatza Pizza, Ci Cis, etc level) and to be honest I have had frozen pizzas that were better.

I find it disheartening that so many people rate this place based completely on the novelty, as I would rather have great food in a bland place then horrible food in a dirty place with a gimmick. 

With all the diverse places and interesting food choices we have in this city, paying for really bad overpriced pizza in a place that they don't even bother to clean is silly - even if they do have a Organ.

And they only take cash? Seriously? My landscape guy even has a credit card machine in his truck, so why can't this place accept debit/credit?

Bottom line, ignore the novelty - if you want pizza go to Spinatos or Mellow Mushroom.Just go to Fry's just a little further eat off baseline and gilbert rd. this place is awful.Possibly the worst pizza and wings I have ever had! Ok, listen, I know Iarrived about 5 min before they closed their kitchen but I called about 15 min earlier and phoned my order for pickup. This still doesn't excuse them for selling crap. The pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust. I know NY pizza is kinda supposed to be thin but "common man"! Even the ingredients were terrible. Low quality bread cheese n pepperoni. I really honestly feel that a Tony's frozen pizza from the super market would have been better. The wings were overcooked, sauceless and very very salty. The only reason I did not take this stuff back is because they were about 4 miles away and my brother n I were very hungry. I come from Los Angeles and I have only been in AZ for a little over 1 month but so far my experience with pizza hasn't been great. This place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do. I never even write reviews good or bad but they got me to actually write one. I would have rated negative stars if I could... SMFH!! I will neva, eva, evaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva.... come here again! Go to Oregano's instead. It's like night and day even though you have to wait forever, it's well worth it.I think Verizon is a great store overall, but walking into this store and trying to get help is exceedingly painful. 
I'm here on a Sunday afternoon between church services, and with me are my wife and her younger siblings, who we have for the day.
My phone doesn't charge, that's why I'm here.  I describe the problem to the assistant that is supposed to help me, and we start talking, but after asking my name and looking up my account, he looks at me and says, 'you aren't an account manager, so I can't help you.'  Period. No more troubleshooting, that's the end of the conversation. 
I Co-own a business, and my business partner is the one that created the Verizon account, so his is the only name on it.  If I need to operate anything or change my plan, I just sign in under that username and password. 
SO. I go about trying to log on using my wife's phone (as mine is out of commission), thinking its going to be a simple process to add myself on as an account manager.  I get back in the queue, and shortly later another representative walks over and starts the process to help, I tell him my phone won't charge, and that I know they cant warranty it out unless an account manager is here. He immediately tells me that if I'm not on the account, he can't do anything for me. I told this guy, 'yes, but I'm adding myself to the account now, so that wont be a problem.'  He was shocked that i would suggest such a thing, and got this tone in his voice that one would use with an unruly child, and told me that its not ok to do that, they cant help me out, and i need to bring in the account manager, because what I'm doing isn't legal.
At that point, tired of being ridiculed, and obviously not getting the help i needed, i decided to take my family and go home!  
Don't come to this store!
It is worth a few more miles' drive to go to the Verizon store on Power and the 60!Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.THEY DON'T WEAR GLOVES.

I watched a lanky kid behind the counter scratch his face then shove some stray fries into their container with the same bare face-scratching hands.  I was mildly grossed out.  Then I realized the fries belonged to me.  Now we're beyond mild.

This is ready-to-eat food.  Being exposed to all the face-scratching, sneezing, money-handling, and other random contaminants out there.   I wanted salt, not Hepatitis A seasoning my fries

So I did the unthinkable.  I brought it up.  And when I did, I was told glove-wearing is a manager's choice.  Well, going there is a customer's choice, so I'll definitely be finding my dinner elsewhere.  Disgusting.The Manager Dani.This little thing is very rude, very bad customer service.. If you say your going to honor something than do it.. I rather shop at Hobby lobby!!!I agree with everyone else that has said their customer service is basically nonexistent. It's a miracle if you can a clerk anywhere in the store besides at the cutting table or the lone clerk at the register and when you do ask a question they look at you like you are speaking and a foreign-language. I've been told, "No we don't have that," and then have come upon exactly what I asked about........  WHO's MONITORING THESE STORES??????I had AZ Exterminating for a long time (~4 years) and all was great (welll not great, I didn't have bugs but there were other issues....). When they decided to switch to a new "better" pesticide that only meant they had to come every other month, that was when this company hit the skids. Also, the new spray service was more expensive, not twice as much but still. The price went up drastically for a per visit fee.
The "better" stuff DID NOT WORK. I had to call them to come back and respray every month, which they did. I got tired of calling every month and said, just put me back on the old monthly service. THEY REFUSED. Said they didn't offer monthly service. So I was like fine, I will call them every month to come for a free respray.
One day I realized I hadn't seen a bill for a while, I checked my records and found they hadn't been here in four months! (It was over the winter so bugs were at a minimum). I let them know this wasn't acceptable and if it happened again, they no longer needed to come here. Lo and behold, it happened again. So I hired a new company. Guess what, AZ Exterminating showed up a month later while I was in Europe, sprayed, and billed me. I refused to pay. They reported it to collections and now its on my credit. 

Meh, I still have a super prime credit rating and AZ Exterm is still a poorly run company. STEER CLEAR OF THEM!!!I was walking the mall and I thought to go into Sears to look at maybe some close. I instead ended up in the electronics. I have been wanting to get a bluetooth speaker. I found one that was a small cube which is cute and it was marked on sale that is a $20 difference then what is the regular price.

There was a register near were I was there were two employees talking to each other at another one. I asked it I could buy this item one says over here. The other employee that rang me up asked the other one if she has to use this certain tablet i think to ring me up instead of the register and the other employee said yes its commission. Uuumm...one thing I picked this item out on my own with out assistance from any employee why should you get commission on that? 

The employee that did the sale didn't seem thrilled through out he whole thing. When the item rang up at regular price and I told her that it was marked on sale she kind of gave me attitude about it, but when we walked over and I showed her the price she did change it. 

I have not really been a fan of Sears and I don't think I will go back.

On a side note I do like the speaker.WORSE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Don Tuck and the manager Tim were horrible. We were quoted several different amounts, and when we finally got to the end stage he said a final amount that was $100 more!!! During the sales process, we were VERY clear about buying 2 chairs and on the final sales ticket the 2 chairs were not included. At the end when we were upset about hearing a higher final amount that what we were quoted, Don "checked with his manager" and decided they didn't want to sell to us. He told us he's off the clock and that Ashley doesn't NEED OUR BUSINESS. I've never been treated this way in sales industry. Don't waste your time, go to Room Store next door - that's what we should have stuck to.The only reason we went here was to use a gift card.... Just as disgusting as i remember.Ordered empanadas to go. Three orders and $28 later...I cut them open and 75 to 80% of them were EMPTY!  (They werent great either) I called the manager and she indicated this is a known issue as they are made fresh onsite. Ok benefit of the doubt. She indicated she would send some coupons my way for throwing my cash down the drain... Has not happened.  I guess I'll be calling AMEX.I usually go to Gunnell's to get my oil changed but my wife and I just moved and this Jiffy Lube was the closest place. So I sent my wife there to have her oil changed and tires rotated, and when she came home she brought me a bill that was over $80. EIGHTY DOLLARS!!! She only had them do a routine oil change and a tire rotation! For one thing, any other service station will do a rotation for FREE if you are doing an oil change at the same time. Apparently it will cost you anywhere from $20-30 at Jiffy Lube. I went back to talk to the manager about the exorbitant prices and he explained to me that Jiffy Lube techs go over the prices with customers beforehand (something that was not done with my wife). After explaining that my wife DID NOT approve an $80 service fee, he told me he wouldn't give us refund and that I would have to call their corporate office if I wanted to pursue it further. Terrible customer service and lack of listening. 

If you want good prices for an oil change, go to Gunnell's. Maybe it won't be as quick but it will cost less than half as much. Needless to say, I will never go to Jiffy Lube again.I've been wanting to go here for a awhile but the line is always out the door and after finally eating there tonight I'm not sure why.  The food is mediocre at best in all honesty it tastes and looks like the food was microwaved.  My girlfriend remarked on our way out that "the best part of the meal was the after dinner mint"  Save your money for Carrabba"s which has much better food.Holy Crap!  The service in this place is a joke!  Have you ever tried to call them? I sat waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  When I went to the store I saw a gaggle of them talking, and not one person came up to help me.I walked around with my gf looking at bedroom sets, I had never been in and have no reason to return.  There was nothing of value in the store for me and I guess its a credit store for those that can't afford to buy furniture.
I wouldn't recommend this store.When you walk into a place and hear what sounds like an explosion followed by what smells like an explosion, that should be clue number one.  But hey, they are cars, they have gas in them, right?  I took my truck in to get an oil change, a new battery and I explained that I probably needed a new battery cable, the negative one was severely corroded.  I picked my truck up, 2 days later, since I dropped it off on a Saturday and they told me that yes they replaced one of my battery cables.  Just to let you know my stress level at this time, I also go laid off the same day I picked up the vehicle.  A week or so later, I get in my truck and it won't start.  I just got it fixed and got laid off.  More repairs are not in my budget at this point.  It's also 2 months before Christmas.  Thank god for friends!  A friend came to check out the issues.  The cable they said they replaced, they did not.  In order to get the battery out they had to break the cable and still didn't replace it, just put it back on broken! The dipstick for the oil was hanging out and there were oily spots all over the side of the truck.  I went back, got my money refunded for the everything except the price of the battery.  My friend had already replaced both cables.  But I will never go back to this Fletcher's again.Like a poor mans version of Sweet Tomatoes. Less choices and less flavor. It's pretty disappointing. Spend the extra couple bucks and drive down the street to a better salad bar, or go to a real restaurantI love Taco Bell! Just not this one. I now drive out of my way not to go to this one. The order is wrong Every time and I really mean every time. Bad service Bad food!This property just lost a customer, and everybody we tell about our stay.  Do not fall for the free breakfast bit.  We booked through Priceline, which indicates a free breakfast.  We had a sub-par breakfast -which would have been fine if it were included.  However, we were charged almost $30.00 for two.  When we told the front desk Priceline indicates the breakfast was free, they referred us to the small print.  I asked "what can you do for us?"  The reply was, "nothing."  Small print or no small print, a property that is unwilling to comp a breakfast to save a customer - when they certainly have the ability to do so - is not going to get my business.  What was supposed to be a short one-night getaway for a weary mom and dad of young children ended on a very sour note.I had a horrible experience at this store because of Michael, a deceitful and/or Incompetent Sales associate. Bottom line: I asked a clear question, and was given a clear answer. The problem is the answer he gave me is different than Verizon's actual policy. I took his word for truth and ended up with something completely different than what I was told I was signing up for. Take caution when dealing with these people, the manager Josh took no responsibility for his sales associates mistake and said tough luck, I can't/won't work to fix the problem.Customer Service Non Existent! I walked into the shop and did not get a single greeting from the three associates. I looked around at the extensions and clip ins for 10 minutes and was not offered any help at all. Save your time and go to a different store for your extension need. Headed over to Mid-K.BUYER BEWARE:  They are trying to charge for install of materials they never install.

I visited the show room and was helped by a man named Patrick.  He was very nice and together we picked out wood for my home.  He told me the cost of the materials ($4.40/sq ft) and the install price of $3.18 a sq ft which was to include: tear out of existing floor and baseboard, the glue for the new wood floors, and re-installation of the baseboard.  He indicated he would have it written up and a contract would be send over to sign via email shortly.  Tricia did so, but the contract was not as agreed.  It added $100 for tear out and re-installation of baseboard.  I called and spoke with Patrick and he indicated he would speak with Tricia and correct it.  They phoned two days later and said he was wrong and they needed to charge the extra $100.  I indicated that I would pull off and reinstall the baseboard myself and to adjust and resend the contract accordingly.  They did so, but then added extra cost in the way of trying to charge me for the install of waste materials (6%).  This is the extra wood cuts that I have already paid for and do not actually get installed, but thrown away.  I called Patrick and he said that is a mistake, and they do not charge for that and he indicated he would have Tricia correct and resend the contract that day.  3 days past and nothing was sent so I called and spoke with Tricia.  She was extremely rude and hostile and indicated that they normally do not charge for this, but since I was using a promotion they were having, they were adding it on.  I said that sounded unreasonable and a little like discrimination.  She hung up the phone.The problem to all this lays in the fact that I came into the store and agreed to Patrick's terms and then paid $500 to enter their promotion.  So now I am stuck in the promotion and work has still not been done.

I have filed this complaint against them to the BBB.org and will also file a complaint with ROC should it not be addressed properly. People deserve to know about their dishonesty.Like the other reviewers, I have had to wait well over an hour for an oil change--even with an appointment.  Any reviewer who says these guys are honest has an ulterior motive.  I bought a 3 oil change for the price of one deal on living social, and this place was the only place open on weekends.  The very first time I went in, they told me my wheels had to be balanced.  I asked how much, they said $7 total.  When I left, they charged $7 per tire.  Ended up paying more than if I'd paid for the oil change.

The last time (and it will be the last time ever), they recommended a list of repairs as long as my arm, INCLUDING the easily verified "your radiator only has water in it and needs to be flushed."  All amounting to nearly $1000.  I took it to my normal mechanic to check out the list.  NOT ONE THING ON THE LIST NEEDED DOING.  The only thing that needed attention was a fraying serpentine belt which cost less than $200.

If you must go here for oil or tires, that's fine.  But be prepared for a wait.  And DON'T LET THEM ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR ENGINE.I have been coming to this car wash for 12 years.  NEVER AGAIN with these new owners!  Asked the manager Mike to explain to me why they charged $200 for one vehicle and $120 for the other. (employees work on commission)  I asked him to look at my vehicles and he told me to "Calm Down".   WOW.....really, that is how you respond to a customer that ask you to explain the fees you charge.   I was told that the price difference was because of the color of the interior.   I explained that I had been coming to this place of business for 12 years and as a long time customer is this how he really wanted to resolve this issue?  He had no interest in making me happy and his explaination of charging $80 more for black interior verse tan was weak.  Don't you charge more for tan interior than black because tan shows more dirt than black.I vacillate between 1 and 2 stars, but after writing this, I am pretty certain I wouldn't live here if FallOut were really real. 
My boyfriend and I moved to Villa Fiesta August of 2010, and signed a 14-month lease, which was what sealed our signing the lease, at $508/month for 750 sq. ft. we couldn't turn it down. Considering the rent, the property was nice, and the leasing agents were friendly.

Once we moved in, the bad dream started and then slowly became a pretty terrible nightmare. On the third floor, we expected to live in relative quiet, largely because no one would be tromping like an elephant over our heads. Sadly, it was much worse than that. Our neighbor underneath blasted metal at 6 or 7am (it varied), so loudly it would wake me up, and she did the same late at night. After reporting her to management several times, nothing was done about it. I talked to her, and she refused to lower the volume. Mind you, it wasn't just a hum of sound, I could hear Megadeath lyrics and sing along with them, and I could feel the bass vibrations through the floor and into my mattress. Absolutely unnecessary.

Our next-door neighbors are fairly nice people, always friendly and polite. However, their beer cans and cigarette containers blow onto our porch (divided by a wall) frequently, and they play their television so loud that I can hear it in the shower on the opposite side of the apartment. I swear the guy deals drugs, as there are new people in and out all the time at all hours of day, and tons of vacuuming at 6 or 7 am. And the husband and wife (now exes) argued all times of day, screaming and yelling over their screaming child. Reporting them to management for violations of quiet hours was a joke, nothing was done.

When we moved in, the refrigerator smelled like several things had died and rotted in there. It took a near miracle to get a new fridge. Our hot water heater didn't work properly, a ceiling light was nonfunctional, and after 3 requests for maintenance they were never fixed. Our shower leaked, no maintenance response. It took 3 days for our leaking dishwasher to be fixed, 1 week to get a new microwave since ours broke shortly after move-in.  

Car thefts, break-ins, noisy neighbors, and unresponsive management and maintenance make this place a horrible disaster of an apartment complex. 

The WORST part of all: they stopped spraying the complex for pests a few months ago, and since then we have had a massive roach infestation, and management hasn't done anything about it. ABSOLUTELY GROSS. When you go into your white-glove clean kitchen at 2 am to get a glass of water, and when you open the fridge and the light comes on there are scatters of little bug feet across the counters, you know it's time to leave. 

I would advise you stay away from this place, even with rent at $508.The meal chosen was tasty but I will not be returning.  As a first time patron, I was given free muffins, with extra protein...a bug crawled out of one of the muffins. Not sure if trying to sue them is worth the time or money so I just won't return and I'll share the video with others so they are informed. It doesn't allow me to attach the video. The muffin may have been carrot, not sure.I was a fan of the original menu at MIMi's. Now that it's all changed out I won't be back. Jalapeños not available either? You know this is Arizona, right?I like to go into gun shops and look around.  Since everyone started to convince themselves the "gubmint" was coming to get their guns it has been an even more interesting experience (I own plenty of guns...but there are some people who have no business having one and a trip to your local gun store will give you exposure to plenty of them).  

So over the years I think probably purchased 2 or 3 guns from this store (in whatever stage of ownership it may have been in), but yesterday's trip was one for the record books.

So the store was relatively empty (about 4 customers or so) and about two guys behind the counter.  One of the guys behind the counter was running his mouth pretty heavily and quite frankly set the world land speed record for racist comments.  Now I'm no shrinking flower here but to hear someone pop off so many comments in such a short period (may 2 minutes tops) was nothing short of racist artistry.  In short his topics were...

- Brown people (he never got to a point on this one, but last I checked about 35% of AZ is populated by "brown people."  I guess he has a problem with them)

- Blacks all have free cell phones (where do these morons get this one?  The program  for phone service for the "poor" (wide definition here and includes Medicare recipients...and the list goes on) was started under Reagan, expanded under Clinton and cell phone inclusion was under Bush II)

- Sand people (this one had something to do with the Boston bombing.  On the other hand, who knows...we live in the desert so maybe he was pissed at AZ "sand people")

- Welfare has increased by 70% for some of the aforementioned groups under Obama (this one is just too stupid to comment on)

There were a few others thrown in, but by this point in his observations on life I was just amazed that he wasn't dressed in a hood and sheet and kind of quit listening.

All in all an interesting trip, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.Yikes! What a stinkin' nightmare! First of all, this would not be a first choice for me, but on a Sunday night there is not much open past 11pm. As I sat down to meet my friend his drink was delivered. Do you think that if you saw a new person sitting at the table you would ask what they would like??? NOT! We had to wait 10 minutes, and I am not exaggerating, for the waiter to come back and ask what I would like. So I ordered the nastiest glass of wine ever. Seriously do not order the Rex Goliath, seriously don't drink there unless you are a beer drinker... After what seemed like another 10 minutes we finally ordered. When the nachos, yes I said nachos arrived we asked for extra napkins as there was only 1 setup on the table. He gave us a stack of cocktail napkins. Really? Nachos and cocktail napkins. Well I got up and got another setup from another table. My friend ordered a beer at that time and after, I kid you not, 15 minutes he had to reorder because he seemed to have forgotten about the order. The nachos tasted like store bought chips and threw a few beans on them, sprinkled a little cheese and meat and threw on some peppers to make it look pretty. Definitely not the tastiest nachos in Mesa!!! Not a good experience both service and food wise. Next time I would rather stay home...Yeap agree with the people here don't be fool by good reviews , this La quinta went down the drain, we stopped staying here last year because everything was awful, and we used to go there often.CAUTION: You may have a paid reservation made in advance, but for some reason it does not mean the equipment is in working order or even on site. You can call ahead of time to ensure it is there to confirm, but (again, for some reason), you will not know until you arrive. You are making all efforts to confirm that your all set on your reservation, in case you need to make arrangements to pick up elsewhere. If it is not on site when you arrive, you are basically screwed because there is no incentive for employees to fulfill/pickup your order. 

There are many situations where Budget cannot fulfill an order and cannot get the equipment you reserved to your pickup location. In that case, they will save whatever they have on hand and make sure that the higher paying accounts are taken care of/serviced first.

FYI: I reserved a rental truck with a dolly. They 'did not have' the dolly on site. Basically, the only option I had was to drive the rental truck to another location to pick up a dolly at a moments notice.

AND THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT. While I was standing there, other customers would walk in. The agent would leave me at the counter and go and service the other customer, wasting my time. 

I wrote a letter of complaint and escalated it to the Executive Correspondence office and all they offered was a refund of the rental of the dolly. The dolly I was given was in such bad shape, wires were sticking out of the tire...barely making it to my final destination 500 miles away.Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us. Ordered pupusas and fried plantain. It took a while before the food came out. This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here. We got our food...plantain was good. The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork. It was alright...had better.  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity. Coming from Vegas, I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people?  That's unheard of. So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it, one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said, "that's our rule...six people or more we have to include gratuity". So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us. So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity. Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people. Mind you...this is within 2-3 minutes time frame, their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people. When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5...she kept on saying "call the manager" and was saying this rudely.The most basic/minimal of necessities. I guess this place has really fallen on hard times, as it is borderline slummy (no such word but there should be). Only stay here if you can't find anywhere else. I'd give it zero stars if this was an option.Why can't I give this place less than one star?

If I wanted a poorly maintained Motel 6 I would have asked for one.  The bed was okay (as far as the mattress comfort) and it was air conditioned.  These were the ONLY good points.  Filthy shower, poor quality TV, no water in the pool, WiFi garbage,   Overall furniture and bedding torn and filthy.  A BIG disappointment for calling it a Travelodge.  I will be skeptical in the future.We had a family emergency in phoenix. I have always used Holiday Inn for my travel lodging since I travel for business so much. I am one of their preferred platinum members and over the course of the past year I have accumulated a lot of reward points. I figured that I would use my reward for one night free while staying in phoenix this time to off set some additional expenses we might have. 
I arrived late that night to check in, I am told that the only suite left is on the second floor so I take this. I was told that my room was around the back ( second bldg closest the the  free way. I pull around into the parking which was packed, parked rather far from the door and began my search for my room ( no maps avail or offered) I look at the building and it is shaped like the letter U. Hmmm. Second bldg closest the the free way would mean in the middle. After searching for a bit I concluded that I was given the wrong directions. It was in fact the last bldg (next to the hwy ) and the room was on the interior wall of that bldg. Ok so now I am a bit annoyed. I go back out for the rest of my luggage and receive a phone call while getting my things out of the car. The phone call was from a family member reporting on the emergency we were having. While I am on the phone two security people decide it wise to approach my vehicle and insist that I roll down the window and tell them if I am a hotel guest and if so which room am I in. ( I guess the lugage in the back wasn't a clue enough nor the fact that I was upset with a phone to my ear. After concluding the call I take the rest of my luggage in. I might add that the entrence to my room involved an exterior entrance gate ( with broken handle) going down an external hall, waiting for the smallest elevator on earth to come down and finally arriving at my room. 

The interior of the room was "OLD" but clean. The doors were in ill repair and in need of replacement. The interior is not up to date which the standard Holiday Inn's that I have stayed at the past year. The only exception to this the bed which Is very comfortable. Drapes, furniture and room decor need updating to new Holiday Inn specs.

The second day of our stay we returned to be locked out of our room. On check in I had used a reward for one night and paid for the second. OOPS someone forgot to tell me that I would have to "re check in"??? This was really handy with my husband arriving the next day waiting in front of the external gate, hands full of luggage trying to get in. We had to repack the car with his luggage and return to check in. WHen I asked " why wasn't I told this" the young man that checked me in the night before proceeded to argue that he had. I advised him this was not the case or I would have done this before I had left that morning. He still insisted he was right and I was wrong. Annoyed i proceeded to Re Check in. The lady which heard the entire conversation then proceeded to ask me again for ID and credit card even though the young man said he checked me in the night before, even though he told her that he knew who I was and what room I was in, even though I had two room keys and confirmed the room that they belonged to and even though my credit card was on file. 

Second morning, my husband gets up wondering where the paper is. As premier members we are supposed to receive a paper in the AM. He goes to the front desk to inquire. AT 7 AM in the morning on a Sunday he was told that they didn't have any and that he could run down to circle K to get one. 

THE WORST HOLIDAY INN EXPERIENCE EVER. THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUR FAMILY EMERGENCY THAT MUCH MORE STRESSFUL.Don't stay here! The rooms are old, the door was falling off the hinges, light fixtures chipped, the bathroom calling leaked right over the toilet, there are cigarette butts all over the ground, the majority of the staff could careless you are a paying guest. The wifi occasionally worked. It was a very uncomfortable experience.The store is great, but the Pharmacy service is Horrible!!!!   The pharmacy staff is unpleasant, not customer service oriented, and doing business with them is frustrating and mentally taxing.  They rarely have prescriptions ready when they say they will be ready.  The store staff is great!  They are helpful and they are always smiling; however, I couldn't be more displeased with the pharmacy.

We have a daughter with a heart condition who requires her meds 3x per day.  On one occasion we had just received a new prescription from her cardiologist and had only a days worth of medication on hand to hold us over. We dropped off a new prescription to be filled late one morning and were told it would take 4 hours to fill.  We returned 2 hours before closing (more than 4 hours later) and were informed that they would not be able to get to it that day.  After explaining our situation and our dismay to the pharmacy manager, we had no other recourse but to take the unfilled prescription back from them and physically take the prescription to another pharmacy.  The prescription was filled within just a few minutes.  

Today, I dropped off another prescription and before leaving they "checked" the prescription to make sure there weren't any "problems" to delay it being filled.  They said it would take 3 hours to fill (I still don't know why it takes them hours to do what others can do in minutes).  2 hours later we get a call stating that there is a "problem" with the prescription and that we need to contact our doctor to have him call the pharmacy to state the quantity.  After contacting my doctor I was informed that the pharmacy was supposed to call them directly.  I then called the pharmacy back and was placed on hold for 9 minutes.  After finally speaking with someone about who I was, I was again placed on hold for another 5 minutes before they came back and I was able to explain to them the protocol. They then said that they called the doctors office but they got the after hours message and we're not able to talk to anyone, which means the hung up without listening to the after hours message.  The message tells them exactly how to "talk to someone", which is what I did when I called.  

This is just a couple of examples of how poorly we have been treated over the last four years by this pharmacy.Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.  

I used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!

This past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with "special sauce" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it.On 11/29/2013, the day after Thanksgiving, 6 of us rented a pontoon to putt around Canyon Lake for a few hours. Afterwards we went to the restaurant for drinks and lunch.
My girlfriend and I had only been here for drinks in the past when out on our Harley...just to sit and admire the view. We had never actually eaten here and certainly never had Bloody Marys here or we CERTAINLY would have known better than to do it again.
We were able to get seats on the patio which was preferred so we could take in the gorgeous view of the lake.
As we walked into the restaurant I was fairly surprised to see only 1 table inside with customers...but the patio was full....by "full" I mean perhaps 10-12 tables...seemingly not at all unmanageable for the wait staff. I made the comment to my girlfriend that it appears the view seemed to be more appealing to folks than the food...astonishingly insightful as we would soon discover.
The service was excruciatingly slow but after having passed us by several times with the promise of returning someone finally stopped at our table to take our drink order. Time just seemed to stop as we awaited our drinks and to place our food orders.
We all ordered something to drink but what turned out to be the topic of intense drama was the Bloody Mary my girlfriend ordered. 
Anyone who drinks Bloody Mary knows there are many many different varieties....some good...some not so good and that decision is made by the person who is drinking it...NOT by the person who made it.
My girlfriend and I BOTH decided this particular Bloody Mary was among the worst we had ever tasted. When the waitress finally made another appearance at our table she asked her to return it to the bar and to please bring her a Michelob Ultra. The waitress said she would get the drink comped and bring her a beer.
This has never been a big deal in the past. If one doesn't like their drink it is the same as if they didn't like their steak...it's not good, we don't want it please take it away and remove it from our bill.
A woman came out to our table...who was later identified by our waitress as the owner....with my girlfriend's drink in her hand. She was extremely rude and had an ugly scowl on her face. She looked my girlfriend in the eyes and said in a fairly loud voice, "What's wrong with the drink"? My girlfriend replied she did not like it. The "owner" said, "this is a Bloody Mary...you ORDERED a Bloody Mary". She sat the drink down in front of my girlfriend as if to force her to drink it. At that point my girlfriend said she did not want the Bloody Mary and then I piped in and said in a loud and stern voice, "we'll pay for the damned thing just take it away!!"
That's all she wanted to hear so she removed it and EVENTUALLY brought my girlfriend a beer.
I have never ever in my 55 years of life been been treated like this in a restaurant. The Bloody Mary was HORRIBLE and this woman was way to proud to be able to IMAGINE that someone could possibly NOT like her Bloody Mary!!...although I would bet it has happened many times in the past. 
Her reaction was if we ordered the Bloody Mary, we're PAYING for the Bloody Mary no matter how horrible it tastes. I just could not believe how this woman was talking down to us and how she was treating us...THE CUSTOMER!!
She likely had less than $2 invested in the ingredients of the drink and she pushed us away...locals who brought in guests from out of town...NEVER to return...over a $2 drink rather than comp it and come outside to tell us she was sorry we didn't like the drink but she had removed it from our bill...which is what one would expect from a respectable place of business where the customer and his/her business is appreciated.
Oh...it doesn't end there...I wish there were an option for 0 stars! I have UNFORTUNATELY had the service (if you want to call it that) of Media Com for a little over a month now and it stinks. I just tried making a phone call and of course AGAIN my phone says "connecting". Not a day has gone by where we haven't had a dropped call or tried to make a call and had to wait. The TV channels choices are okay for what we pay and the internet speed is good....when they are working. The price was right that's why I switched service providers ...until next year... ...the year after..... El cheapo here, I wish I would had someone reminding me that you get what you pay for!!! Not that the service will be any better next year when the prices increase I'm sure.ugh
Like I said, not a day goes by where we don't get service interruption.So I came here last Saturday and tried the Cantina chicken burrito and loved it. I came here today and ordered the same thing, and seriously thought I was eating a veggie burrito there was hardly any chicken in it. Boo... not sure what givesThis is one of the filthiest restaurants I have ever had the misfortune to go into - I was shocked that this place remains open.  The food was worse than mediocre - truly poor in every aspect.
ICK.Amazing -- I ordered the same sundae I ordered at a Mesa DQ yesterday and was charged $1.04 more for it here.  That ain't sales tax and when I asked about it, I got a lot of lip.  

So, if you like price-gouging by a staff with an attitude, c'mon down to fashionable Apache Junction!This restaurant is living off it's laurels not it's good food.  We were very disappointed several times and will not go back.  Service is okay but the food was awful.Undoubtedly the ghastliiest food experience we have ever endured. My wife and I are very seasoned travelers, i am English and work on cruise ships across the globe, 50 weeks a year. We are also food adventurers and eat in some the oddest places, especially in the Far East. But this was utterly abysmal. Chicken and beef fajitas that had past their sell by date at least 2 days prior - stale chips, guacamole the strangest shade of khaki and salsa which resembled something that had been meticulously scraped from the bottom of a parrot cage. We paid begrudgingly only because the waitress was so attentive (mostly to distract us from what's as languishing on our plates). The following day, today, I have even had a bad stomach. My wife phoned the manager this afternoon, not looking for recompense or a free meal (god forbid) but merely to point out how poor the food was, and was curtly informed that it was our fault because we didn't complain enough at the time! This is truly the Mexican Fawlty Towers and not quite so funny either. If you are considering eating here, I would avoid this place like hemerrhoids.
By the way, avoid the churros like Ebola. I was still chewing the wretched thing 15 minutes after leaving the restaurant.Decent food - IF  you can Spanglish your way through ordering, and IF you actually get what you ordered. Management is POOR... don't expect a refund if they mess up your to-go order. COMPRENDE???Okay, this is hard for me, but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this. I have always been a fan of Big Wa. I have been eating here for five years, perhaps a bit longer. Today may keep me from going back. The food was great, always is, service was TERRIBLE. The server rushed us out as if our business was not important. Before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said "Okay" and picked up our plates. To be fair, mine was empty, but my fiance and my 2 year old 
daughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable.Horrible Pet Care.  As an animal lover I want the best care for my loved ones at all times.  I felt like I was in a used car lot by the time I left this place.  The vet was smug and uninterested in my pets concerns.  Their primary concern was up-selling unnecessary tests and products.  Literally 2 min was spent on examining the actual pet and 45 min was spent trying to sell me very expensive dog food and random blood tests that I felt were only a rue to get more money out of me.  Total estimated bill was going to be $300 with these up-sells.  Instead of explaining to me that my dog may have a lack of fiber in her diet and showing me ways I could improve that, the nurse was sent back 3 times while I waited in a room with my sick dog to try and sell me $75 dog food with fiber in it.  The dog has arthritis and has been taking medication for that for 3 years now.  The vet would not renew this medication unless I spent $150 additional money to run extra tests on top of the $100 visit I was already expected to pay.  This was my first visit and it will be my last, drive your pet into the Phx area for a quality experience.I ordered an arrangement for a celebration of life and they never delivered and didn't call to warn me. Didn't receive a call until the next day. Unprofessional and unreliable!The staff is rude and treat the customers like an inconvenience. 2 hour delivery times?!?!?!?!? Really?Sorry folks, but this place needs a major renovation. It could be a cool '50s-type restaurant if they would spend a little money to clean it up. The food is greasy, and some of the waitresses are sporting tattoos and multiple piercings - a major turnoff for the food industry in my opinion. Try Big House Cafe down the street if you want a good breakfast at a good price in a clean environment. Pass this one by.I am so done with outback steakhouse. We went there last night for a birthday dinner and we had so many issues everybody was upset about the meal. Ryan our waiter did not put the orders incorrectly, they had to remake a chicken salad which took forever to get back out to the table, my girlfriend's salad was not correct, they tried to fix it and made it worse. Ryan was very un-caring and the manager did not offer to make something else when the salad was bad the second time. This is the third time I've had issues with outback and we will not be back!I went into inner vision and the man at the desk was soooo rude I was shocked. He was kind if an older fellow with salt and pepper hair, I think he is one of the owners but wouldn't swear to it. Anyway, I've always thought of the place as this calm zen kinda place but this guy sent such a negative "get the hell out of here" vibe I'll never be back. There are so many yoga places springing up customer service with a smile is very important. I personally will take my practice to Sumits.This dry cleaner may be the least professional, and poorly managed of any that I have ever been to. I have had atleast 3 bad experiences including poor/no pressing on dry cleaned items, items being returned without being cleaned, however, this last experience put a nail in the coffin. I took one of my favorite work dresses here to be routinely dry cleaned (they had cleaned it 3 previous times without a major issue), and it was returned to me COMPLETELY ruined. It had black ink ran all over the dress, even so much that it was on the tag they attached to it. I returned it to them, told that "it happens sometimes", and then told I would be compensated. It has been over a week, and still no call from the manager with a resolution, or time frame for reimbursement. Its clear that in this circumstance you get what you pay for!This place has really gone downhill fast. I have been going here for years, and really not paid attention to the competitors. They used to be called 1.00 cleaners. And at that price, I wasn't picky at all. Now? Not only have their prices soared, and force you to join their "club" for implied coupons, etc...  Well, I haven't received one coupon yet, and lastly, even Tide cleaners is now less expensive on laundry, and they do a great job. So my review is, DON'T waste your money at legend cleaners. The free bottle of 11 cent water does not make the difference.I didn't even want to give one star. I don't know what happened to Nypd. I placed my order and they had to call me back to tell me they don't make a certain item anymore. I read it right off there website, they need to update their menu. Nypd use to be my favorite place to get pizza, not anymore. To make matters worse they charged me extra for getting a similar dish and didn't tell me, intern the delivery boy didn't get a big enough tip since I was paying with all the cash I had on me. I felt so bad! Nypd need to clean up their act!The norm, food is so so....not my first choice!  I have honestly given this restaurant chain a burger taste. Simply can't go back...maybe they have other decent food but for burgers, ah I can forget it!!They are the worst daycare I seen most of the teachers sucks and the director is rude     They let my 2 years old cry for a stickerI washed my jeep here yesterday & selected their '$6.00 WASH,' middle of the line car wash. AND WAS CHARGED $10.00 on my bank statement. I went back through my bank statement and this happened before on 6/26/2014. I cannot get ahold of this company from their phone number provided. There isn't even a $10.00 cash wash option! Most expensive is $7.00. 

DO NOT GO HERE.This place can be summed up in one word: DISGUSTING. I have been to Burger King before, so this review is NOT about the quality of the food. I have eaten at this restaurant before via drive-thru, but this was my first visit where I ate-in. I wish I hadn't. With the scorching summer temperatures and two very bored kids, I figured we'd hit a place with an indoor playground so they could burn off some energy. 

Walking in the door, there was an odd smell. It should have been my first sign to turn around and leave. But with two small kids gunning for the playground, there was no way I could drag them back out without eating or playing without a screaming fit. So I pushed on, ordered food and paid. The service was friendly enough. 

The buttons on the drink machine were sticky. Gross. Sign #2 that I should grab my kids and run. The indoor playground had only four tables in a wide open room, with two of them taken and one filthy, I opted for the only table available. The chair was sticky as we sat down. Already, before eating, my stomach churned at the thought of the impending food poisoning. 

Everything was filthy at this location. I regret not grabbing my kids kicking and screaming and dragging them from the restaurant.

But it wasn't until I noticed the large rat house-style trap on the side of the building that I realized what I'd just subjected my family to. 

Needless to say I will not be returning. The kids got a head-to-toe sanitizer bath in the car and a full bath as soon as we got home, in hopes of killing some of the germs that are no doubt crawling on every inch of their skin as a result of playing in the playground. 

I would rather brave the 115 degree playground than return to this restaurant! YUCK!I paid for a full car wash and an orbital wax. It was a terrible job and my car had a mark on it. They said did you see it happen, since my car was out of sight 85% of the time I could not swear I saw it happen. I called the corporate office and talk to a person named Droste who is the operation manager and requested the name of their insurance carrier and he would not give it to me. He said they would just roll over and pay the claim and he did not want the claim against them. I do know the mark was not there when they drove it away to wash it. Being it was on the driver side it was hard to miss. Rude, terrible wash and wax and a damaged car.This place was gross, the review b4 me must have been the last time they CLEANED. The employees were just as rude, they sat my hubby and I at a dirty booth and the food was gross plus they got the order wrong. Do yourself a favor don't come here :))If I had the option to give no stars that would be my first choice, but unfortunately I will have to give them this one. This is by far the worst medical office I have ever been to. For starters, they have medical assistants,  untrained in front office policies and insurance, working the front office (via iPads) and discussing patient sensitive matter in front of the entire waiting room. On multiple visits I have witnessed multiple hippa violations (one major being the time they asked me to recite my social security number in front of another patient checking out) on different occasions. Unfortunately for them, because of my profession, I am completely up to date on HIPPA regulations and plan to file an official complaint through the .gov website.  I will never return to this office again nor will I refer. Thought I would branch out and give a public practice a try but never again. Private practices would NEVER treat a patient the way I was treated here. Don't bother booking, they'll more than likely ask you to come in early just to let you know they won't see you when you're two minutes late. Ridiculous.If I could give this place a 0 I would... We stopped in today and I paid $4.50 for a large guac to go. Imagine my surprise when I opened it in front of my guests and it was so watered down it was soup. I had to throw it away and apologize to my friends. I will NEVER spend another penny at this place. You have been warned!UGH.

One, they don't honor groupons or restaurant.com certificates on any happy hour items. Two, the food is definitely not the best Mexican in the area. There are far better places within a block or two. 

It's overpriced and definitely not easy on the stomach. We had margaritas, beer, the chicken nachos, and some 1/2 taco baskets. Today, all three of us have some serious stomach issues. The nachos were large (and for $15 they should be) but they had cheese, onions, refried beans, jalapenos, chicken, and sour cream. We had to ask a number of times to get our salsa refilled (there was never enough, and only one brought each time). The tacos didn't taste like much, just deep-fried shells without much flavor.

The ONLY thing I liked was that refried beans are served with the salsa and chips. 

Go anywhere else.I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?

I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.

Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.Don't go to this restaurant.  The employees are THIEVES.   My daughter left her phone on the table and went back to get it from the parking lot.  When she got back to the table the phone and the tip was gone.  The employees claimed they didn't have or see the phone.  I used Lookout security to locate the phone 4 hours later at the restaurant and returned.  When I did the employees again played innocent.  We then made the phone scream using the software.  When we did someone in the restaurant stashed the phone in the men's bathroom in the toilet brush holder (YUK).   Proof is that an employee had the phone and wouldn't give it up to me or my daughter until they couldn't silence it and had to stash it in the bathroom.  Again, nothing but a bunch of thieves work there and they'll steal from you any chance they get.Worst shopping experience EVER!  I went in to get a new harness for my dog.  Not knowing what size he needed, we sit on the floor to try a couple on.  Employees taking inventory literally trampled us.  No pause for me to move, no excuse me, I had to make sure I wasn't wearing my invisibly cloak again. When I said something to them, they did not even acknowledge me.  

Once I found the right harness and found some other things I needed, I went to the checkout where things got worse.  The clerk was surly at best, impossibly rude even.  I walked out of there feeling terrible, and my dog, who loves to go shopping when he's allowed, was so depressed that not one staff member even acknowledged his presence.  Have you ever had to deal with a depressed dog with self esteem issues?  It took several cookies and 3 rides in the car to make him feel better!

While I still think Petco over all has decent selection and prices, the people at this store are what got them a single star.  I will probably end up giving them a second chance in the future, and hopefully the experience will be different.We usully go to both petco and petsmart for our fish tank needs. We recently got a clown loach from petco and today (about a week after we got him) we noticed it had ich extremely bad, and another one of our fish seemed to have the early stages. We returned to petco today and noticed the tank carrying the clown loaches had ich. a few other tanks did as well. We talked to the employee and he said that he didn't notice it and that all the tanks had the same water supply, meaning, if one tank had it all the fish could be infected. After he finished talking to us he went to sell fish to a family. THEIR FISH INFECTED OUR TANK WITH ICH, AND THEY ARE STILL SELLING FISH WHEN THEY KNOW THEY HAVE ICH. Not to mention they only have 3 employees working at once, so you have to search for one to even get this fish. We will never return to a petco again.When my husband and I walked into the office for the first time to view an apartment everyone was so nice and welcoming, but after we signed the rental agreement we were no longer important. When I go into the office they are very rude, the woman who showed us the apartment even asked us to move in a day later so she could be there now she has no idea who we are. Everything in the apartment breaks, the toilet water in my kid's bathroom never stops running, the sink in our kitchen leaked down into our cabinet in pools, the roof leaked at the first sight of rain, and the kicker, i can see into my neighbor's house through the laundry room door, and we have lived here for 5 months. They have no loyalty to their tenants.  They could not possibly care less about anyone but themselves. It is true, you get what you pay for.I agree with Dani. This Einsteins Bagels is slow! I went here this morning just to pick up a Hate to Wait Basket and I had to wait for the Hate to Wait Basket. First,  I had to wait in a long line until the Bagel Man decided to take the guy's order 3 people ahead of me. Before than he was dilly dallying around throwing bagels in the slicer. Second, it seemed that they were preparing a big order, because I had to wait again until the manager was free to pick the bagels to throw in the basket. Does it really take 3 people out of 5 to prepare one order. 

To top it off, the cashier was making small talk to the police officer in front of me. He was telling him his woes of ringing up the order and how sometimes how he needs to be creative in typing in the order. PLEASE, shut up and let the man pay for his grub!! Don't get me wrong. I like small talk, but not when folks are trying to get their day started.we ordered two rib eye 12 oz steaks.  This was not the "dinner for two".  When the server brought out the steaks we were shocked.  They looked like thin pieces of top sirloin.  We expressed our dismay to the server and the manager came to our table.  He tried to say that prices had gone up and the cuts of beef were thinner.  It was simply a way to "get through it".  He never came back and neither will we.  The bill was $60.00.  No wonder there were very few cars in the parking lot.I have to post my experience here. I used to come here for business and take out once in a while. I called on 3/22 and ordered #5 with chicken and double rice, no beans. I opened the box and it was cheese (no chicken) and beans.. I called and let them know. I was told that they would charge my card back $16.25.. 

It is now 4/17 and I have not seen my money back. I have also called and left 8 messages for the manager who is apparently never there, nor does she call people back.. 

I am a member of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and now everyone there knows my experience. I'm extremely disappointed that I was just lied to and blown off after all the $$ I have spend there in the last 4 years. The food has really gone downhill and my husband never wanted to go because he says its just microwaved food that's marked up 10x.. Maybe this place will go out of business before they fix what's wrongHonestly, I'm a bit surprised by the number of good reviews.  My experience was far from positive.

Service was terrible.  As the four of us in our party observed, the waitress made a habit of bringing hot food out on a cart from the kitchen, and rather than immediately serve it to the table, she would stop by other tables on the way, takes orders, ask if they needed anything, etc.  This happened multiple times.  Seems to me that should be the other way around.

I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The rest of my party was served their food about 10 minutes before mine.  That is also unacceptable.  They felt bad about eating without me, and I didn't want their food to get cold.  The kitchen needs to learn how to time food so an entire table's order comes out at once.

We had to ask our waitress several times for napkins, silverware, and salsa.

After all of this, the food was sub-par.  My chicken lacked any resemblance of flavor.  The rice and re-fried beans were fine, except for the clearly over-cooked, dried out edges of beans around the plate.  The only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla.  At least they can get cheese and tortillas to cook right.

They also charge $2.50 for a second helping of chips and salsa.  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for more chips & salsa.

Overall, being my first Mexican restaurant experience in Arizona, I'm VERY disappointed(come on guys, I can throw a rock to the border.  I expected better!)  

I definitely won't be back.For this review I would give NO stars if I could.
I purchsed an office chair about 1 year or so ago and bought the extended warrantee.
The chair broke so I filed a claim.
I have been without an office chair since June 9th now because they run you through all sorts of hoops to get your money back to buy a new chair.
Tomorrow will be one month and they just barely emailed me that they will issue the refund SOON!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!
Shame on the warrantee company, shame on Staples for PUSHING the warrantee on you, and SHAME on staples for using such a lousy service.I was a hankering some Mexican food, basic fare ya know!  Well, YELP listed Mucho Taco...so why not!  My first impression walking the through the door was somewhat mixed.  The tables were all stacked with dirty plates with the exception of one table.  Now, one could suppose they had a busy lunch time and the food is good, or not.  I chose to think it was good food and a busy location.

I placed my order and was provided chips and salsa to snack on while waiting for my meal.  My dish arrived shortly and the food was OK, nothing memorable as I cannot even remember what I ordered.  What does stand out is the counter help was cleaning the tables and the following was observed.

My first few bites were OK, nothing special except for the hair in the salsa bowl.  Maybe a forgone warning!  I asked for another salsa bowl before my observations noted below.   As I sat there the counter help was cleaning the tables with a dish rag which we see and most likely do at home, right?  Except the food debris she swept off the table was landing onto the seated benches, large chips, small chips and whatever else was very noticeable.  She neither cleaned the benches or attempted to pick up the large food debris from the seated areas.

The green and red sauce bottles were collected and placed on the servers counter along with what perceivably was a full bowl of salsa as she cleaned the tables.  Other salsa bowls collected from the tables were taken to the kitchen along with the dirty dishes. The green and red sauce bottles along with the full bowl of salsa was taken back to the kitchen...follow me, the full bowl of salsa on the table was most likely placed back into a larger vat for reuse later to other customers....if not, then why separate this one salsa bowl and place with green and red sauce bottles??

So, I said all that to say this...

YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN...I WON'T BE BACK!Went there tonight.

Worst Sushi I have ever had.A friend and I went into this Fed Ex Office to have them blow up the timpani part for Beethoven's 7th Symphony.  The manager said that they cannot copy music because it is protected under copyright law.  We tried to explain that the 7th Symphony was written in 1811 and is Public Domain but he insisted that "somebody owns the copyright on it."  Unfortunately, that manager does not understand how copyright law works.  We even showed him that the music was available on the International Music Score Library Project (www.imslp.org) which only has works that are in the public domain and he said that he cannot trust something just because some website says it's true.

I wish that manager could understand that everything that exists on a piece of paper is protected under copyright law so, when a college student throws their text book on top of your copier, that's protected under copyright law, when someone brings in a picture and copies it, that's protected under copyright law - however, copyrights do have limits and do not last forever.  Works do become public domain after a certain amount of time and orchestra pieces written in the 1800s are in the public domain now.

The manager did suggest a "loop hole".  He said that if we submitted the print job online and clicked the "I understand I can't print anything protected under copyright" box that they would then be able to print our music for us because, for some reason, us clicking a box relieves them of their duties to protect the assets of those who hold the copyrights.

Unfortunately, we will not be returning to this Fed Ex Office for any or our printing needs due to this managers refusal to understand how copyrights work.Went in today to ship a package out using Ground shipping. As soon as I walked in the door, I was greeted by a friendly woman however when I approached the counter the man behind it just stared at the box I was holding. I asked if I could set it down and he just nodded, didn't point to a place or greet me at all and he just kept staring at the box. Realizing I packed it upside down, I made a joke about that, figuring that was the problem. He just nodded and then slid the box closer to him so he could examine the label, I told them both that the label was old and I forgot to remove it, so I'll need a new one. At this point the man is giving me the creeps so I asked him if there was a problem. This is when he tells me, wait for it....Well this is the same box we receive our supplies in, so I'm kinda wondering if you stole it from the dumpster out back. I couldn't believe this - because I'm using a FedEx box I must have dived in your dumpster? I said that was a really weird thing to say and looked around at the other two workers who seemed unfazed. He still made no attempt to help me - so I said I was really uncomfortable and would be taking my business elsewhere. He didn't apologize, try to explain or clarify - I took my box and walked out. I've never in my life been treated this way even at the post office during Christmas! Unbelievable. DO NOT go to this location.I had to go see what all the bad reviews were about. Spot on! I didn't even get a chance to get bad service since there was no service to begin with. I looked a sales person in the face from three feet away, no response, no "hello", no "how may I help you". She just turned and walked away. There were six people working and three unattended customers. They just stood around trying as hard as they could to not sell anything. I wasn't even upset since I went in there expecting that or worse. 

This gun shop deserves a rating of LOL.I've been to Cyclo twice. The first time was great. The food and service was really good. Pretty reasonably priced. Really loved the fact that you could bring your own wine. Went back about a year later. Again, food was great. The garlic green beans as good as I remember. Pretty good service. The owner was there again in another cute little dress (sorry, but I notice that kind of shit). Liked the check holders had customer graffiti all over them (more dumb shit I notice). Finished the wine and meal, hit up the bathroom before leaving. Only one and it was occupied. Fine, it's a small place I understand. Wait a bit, then our spiky haired waiter comes out. He gives me a shifty look, which I didn't understand. I Immediately get it once I make my way in and look at the toilet. Didn't even put the seat up. Piss everywhere. I was so mad. Unfortunately, the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time I came out. F'n disgusting. I hate to judge the place by one waiter, but feel like if they are gonna let this ahole work here, can't help but think what else they might be letting slide.  
Sorry, won't be back.I normally don't take the time to write reviews on anything but my experience at this place motivated me to create a yelp account.  First, the owner was irritating and sarcastic. I almost wanted to tell her to leave us alone so we can eat. She must think she is something. Second, the food was average, I have had far better vietnamese food. Third, servings were small for the price we paid for. Fourth, this place is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for a vietnamese place. Last and certainly not the least... I don't recommend this place. Went there once and will never ever go back again. Bad place guys, not worth your time and money.Pho ga chicken was dried out. The spring rolls were the smallest portion I've ever seen & the peanut sauce was watered down. I've tried eating here twice. I give upIf I could give zero stars I would.  Stopped in for lunch. No one in the place (not a single soul), that was probably my first warning. I sat down anyway, on their hard, uncomfortable plastic chairs (seriously, the decor is very cafeteria like), and started to look over the menu. Pho for $10?? It better be some amazingly good pho! So I sat and I sat, waited and waited. The server/owner/manager/whoever that greeted me when I walked in had gone in the back and after waiting 10 minutes I decided to just leave. Give me a break. There is NO ONE in the place. I'm your ONLY customer and you're going to just let me sit there forever? No thanks. Went to my usual go-to for pho at Pho Van and had an awesome lunch.I went to this business many years ago and would not go any where else.  This time I can't even get through the door.  First I called several times leaving messages that were not returned until some called and left me a half-hearted message saying I am just calling in case some else didn't call you.  Knowing their past reputation I kept trying until I got someone on the phone and made an appt.  They called and confirmed my appt for today.  We showed up with our pet on time for our appt and waited on hour outside and no one showed.  They obviously do not need any new business or they would honor people's time.  My husband has a job as I do I and we do have the time to wait.  We called their number, there was no message that there had been an emergency.I was leaving the bank when a roach that was about five inches long crawled across the tile.  Being the man that I am, I diverted my course and walked fifty feet out of the way to avoid it.  The nice woman that was helping Dallas G and me set up our account smote the roach with a rebel yell and two strikes of her foot.

one star, only because I can't put zero starsTypical big box shop, new employees every time i have come in (high turnover speaks volume) poorly trained, most management are not riders, and no sense of urgency!!! Everyone i spoke with acted as if I were inconveniencing them by trying to spend money.

Save your time and money, this place is a glorified Cycle Gear.Called to schedule a simple 5k, and I got a lot of "Uhhhhhh's" and "Ummmmms" which is never confidence inspiring from the get go. They were $105 higher than another dealership i wont mention- and wouldnt work with me on that price. He proceeded to tell me theyre not busy at all and could have someone finish it quick. So youre not good at your job, youre expensive, and not busy? Shocking.This place lost my business today because of a rude cashier. I arrived at the register the same time as another lady. Since I had two items and she had over 10, I verbally requested to go first and she accepted. I came up to the register and was ignored. The cashier continued to gossip about something ridiculous and started ringing up items from the lady behind me's cart!  I was shocked!  The lady behind me asked, "Were you done?" to which I replied, "I guess so..."
Had I not had to go to work shortly after, I would have told that lady about herself and left the store without even purchasing anything. Since I am a busy business woman, I decided I would retaliate by taking my business elsewhere in the future.  I can't even be completely mad at the cashier or wish any ill will towards her because besides being cross-eyed and overweight, her attitude assures me that she will always have a minimum wage job and is probably living in her own personal Hell every day.If I could no stars I would... We came in 2min before close as 2 other people were being served but we were told that they were the last people they were serving. Horrible business practice will never return there again. I understand you want to go home (I worked in a restaurant for 6 years) but at the end of the day we came in before close you should have served us.Horrible, horrible, horrible.

Had an appt for 1pm on a Tuesday, wasn't seen until 1:45pm.
Problem wasn't fixed, so back in I went, this time Saturday at 12:50pm.
Wasn't seen until 1:40pm.

At least the MVD has a tv and lots of chairs and places to wait.  This place is the biggest cluster@#$@#, and there is absolutely nowhere to comfortably wait for your appointment to be called.

So yeah, thanks Apple Store, I now dread you more than the MVD.Bought my engagement ring here and used the layaway process since we would be waiting a little while.  The whole process, and especially the customer service, was a huge headache.  We were given conflicting information from management and staff and no transaction was ever simple.  Even upon receiving the ring, when it was not resized as I was told it would be, I received attitude and blame from the manager.  As the customer of a huge, and what should be joyful, purchase, I was left feeling very upset.  I don't appreciate the manager being rude, short, and cutting me off when I have a concern.  I will not purchase from Helzberg again and regret choosing this company initially.the restaurant was nearly empty at lunch time 12:30. this shouldve told me something, even though when i got there i had to go to the back of the rest. for someone to help me. i finally sat down, and ordered one taco, one chile relleno and one enchilada. let me tell you the girl brought the plate and it was so hot i think the plate had either been placed in the microwave or in the oven. the taco and the chile were deep fried and both were dripping with so much oil it was disgusting all i could taste was oil. the enchilada was really salty and the lettuce was basically a spoon full. the presentation of the plate was horrendous there was so much enchilada sauce on the plate it got into the chile relleno and the taco. the salsa i got with the chips was watery and it seemed to me it was not fresh at all, seemed more like canned. i have had many great foods at low eateries..this place charged me 15.00 for this simple plate. it was such an outrage i did not finish it nor gave a tip. i will never return nor will i recommend. this place is a disgrace to mexican food, especially labeled "home made" unless "home made" is code for crappy. taco bell cooks better.Every Cheesecake Factory will have the same quality food, but the service will greatly vary.  I placed an order for a cheesecake for someone's birthday at work several days in advance.  I told them my name, my order, and specifically requested that the cake be ready by 11:30 A.M. on the pick up date.  When I came at 11:30 to pick up my cake, they did not have my name on any order, and they did not have any whole cakes defrosted.  The cashier took my order right there and gave me the requested cake, but then proceeded to ask me "Are you going to eat this cake right now?"  Telling her that our party was at noon, she proceeded to tell me "You are going to have to wait 1.5 hours for the cake to defrost."  What??  She did add in a quick "Sorry" but in that "Sorry, but deal with it" tone.  Due to this location's poor planning and bad customer service, we were unable to have the cake for the lunch party.  Since we were at work, we could not wait 1.5 hours for it to defrost since we only had a small block of time to serve it and eat.  I'm never getting anything from this location again, and if you get anything to go, I'd be wary of ordering any whole cakes from them.WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! My family of 4 waited over an hour for our food and the server NEVER came to let us know why it was taking so long, refill drinks or check on us for anything! My husband finally had to track down a manager and she told us the computer system crashed, still no communication between management and the patrons, staff or anyone, when the food came it was horrible and cold, we were beyond unhappy. Will NEVER go back.We were waiting 15 min for someone serve us, and then 10 min for ordering food, the coming 20 min for food cooking and came out no napkin no silverware but a rush guy threw the dish on the table then left.  That's my first experience eat at CHEESECAKE FACTORY, but also last time too at least the last time!  Btw, the food is under cook!  Good luck!  Guys.I've been to MAC twice and not one time out of the 10 people they have working the counter do I ever get asked for help! My intentions were to go to lush but we couldn't find it and didn't have much time to find it! I had the worse experience at MAC yesterday. I wish I wore Lancôme because that lady was attentive and nice! I will never spend my money at this MAC counter again!Customer service at the MAC. Not good.

If you want to be unnoticed for 20 mins or beg for service you'd love the Mac section here.
If not, Scottsdale would be worth the long trip!This location is pretty bad.  Be warned if you go in at an off hour they will just let you stand there and never take your order.  I have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all.  Not sure where they go. They tend to always put way too many raw onions in the burritos.  If you have to eat here tell them to hold the onions.

Maybe the other locations are better.I have had hit or miss experiences here.  Many good ones but the last one was so bad I will NEVER go back.  I ordered the crispy tofu with brocolli.  It had very little sauce, the tofu was so uncrispy and the brocolli was not cooked at all... not al dente but HARD.  Then within 20 minutes of leaving I was sick as could be.

When I complained about my food they took it back to the kitchen and I swear brought the exact same food back to me.I should've stayed at Country Brook where I was. I have had the worst exp ever living here at this property. Mgmt is absolutely horrible. This place is a rip off....I've complained about dirty carpet stains, unleveled floors, poorly constructed bathroom where I have to wash one hand at a time because both of my hands rub against the back of the sink because the faucet is too close. The response from mgmt. was pretty much oh well..then they have the nerve to charge 350.00 to transfer to another unit, and run another credit check and verify employment all over again. RUN RUN RUN. As I look now for another apt., when I see it being managed by ALLIANCE I laugh and keep searching. I absolutely cannot wait to move out of this rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, not to mention the many complaints I have made against my neighbors for playing basketball inside of their apt at 1am. I hate it here!!!! Never had a freezer that won't even keep ice cream frozen, and never in a "luxury" apt with a 1980 oven! I HATE THIS PLACE AND MGMT.Had the NY  strip, green beans, Mac & cheese and key lime pie. Out of a group of four that shared the same side dishes, I ended up getting food poisoning! Three days later and I'm still feeling the effects and lost six pounds too! I will not be going back... Diner beware!They are very nice to you right up to the point you make a purchase.  If you have any issues with the purchase, good luck.Been eating at this place for over 15 years, regularly... some of the older employees recognize us... and then we get this jerk for a manager. For 15 years on and off I order and they make chicken or beef tacos for me al a carte. So, I order them like usual and the mgr. comes over and says I won't make them for you, not on the menu. OK... I say, just put some ground beef in a tortilla and I am good. He says no! I am so frustrated! This was my favorite dive bar and now, on principle, I refuse to go back. I asked the manager if I could speak to the owner and he said no... boy, I wonder how much business this jerk has lost / is losing for this poor owner!Made a special order over the phone only to have the wrong parts show up. Had to drive two hours in to straighten out the issue in person. Three weeks later the correct cams arrived. Drove another two hours in to have them changed out, the guy decided to keep my original cams. Theres a word for that, I thinks its "theft". While the work was being done a courteous salesman talked me in to purchasing a $120 sight set up assuring me that his technician would install and adjust on the spot.  Once I told the technician about the sight installation and adjustment I was met with a very poor attitude and an angry reply. He then informed me there was a one day turn around on sight installation. I told him I had a two hour drive one way, he did not seem to care that I had just spent $400 dollars in the store.  He installed the sight but refused to adjust and zero it. After arriving home and taking a closer look at the sight, it turns out someone switched a cheaper model sight with the more expensive $120 model sight I had bought earlier that week.  The technician did not catch it or did not bother to mention it. It's too far to drive and too much of a hassle to try and return it. I will be taking my money elsewhere and I would advise you to do the same.literally, the worst pedicure and customer service I have experienced. The man who preformed my pedicure was pleasant pleasant enough but when i asked if he could do a nail design did not understand me. 

I was excited to have a hot stone massage (which is included) in all of the pedicures. My service provider did not apply any pressure and gave me and a not so relaxing massage. also, isn't a pedicure about your feet?! He did not touch the bottoms of my feet with lotion, no nice massaging, no pressure points hit, no massaging of my calves. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, not worth $20 any day.I stopped in here for dinner recently to see how the place looked after their recent "remodel" and I was surprised to see that even though there were improvements made to the exterior (fresh paint, expanded parking lot, and nicer patio) the inside looked exactly the same except they had replaced the rundown, ugly, uncomfortable tables and chairs with others that were only slightly less ugly and uncomfortable. Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.

There still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler.AVOID THIS PLACE and save your money! Went there 3/1/2014 with my 2 kids and had a horrible experience. Far from family friendly. We also took a certificate from restaurant.com since they say they accept them and they refused to take it from us. The food is 100% greasy food and way over priced. Find another place and save your money so that you are not disappointed and waste your hard earned money!Made a mistake...thought this was the place I had been before several years back. It was not. The food was poor, they added on for sour cream, sauce on my burrito, beans, etc. the bill doubled. No mention of any additional costs by the waitress. The service was equally lacking. They simply didn't seem to care or be happy to be working there. Upon leaving...realized the place I meant to go was only two blocks farther up the street.there were some kids here today who were  talking about very innappriate subjects and are not even customers. there are some kids nearby who were listening to this crap. why are the kids allowed tocome in here?*shakes head*

I am baffled. Truly baffled. How does a place like this stay in business?! It's kinda...crap. Well, not kind of, it is.

I've been there on about 5 different occasions. The first 3 were cringeworthy. I have to confess that all the times I went was because I happened to be close by and the people I was with were all gung ho about it. Truth be told, if they had waited about 10-ish minutes, I could've had them at a different mexican restaurant -- a million times better than Serrano's.

The 4th time I went, the chicken enchiladas I had were so incredibly good, I felt that it made up for the previous times. I happened to be in the neighborhood several weeks ago and dropped into Serrano's.

Nuh uh. Nerp. Nope. Hell to the no. F*ck no. Never again. My chicken enchiladas was gross...and I've never called any mexican food gross. This was pathetic beyond description.

Avoid this place. The only truly redeeming quality were the servers we have had each time I've gone there - fast, friendly and courteous. Sadly, it's not enough to make me want to go back.My boyfriend and I grew up on Serrano's living in Tempe. It had been years since we have been so we figured we would stop in for happy hour. I cant believe how badly this place has gone down hill! Though there was only a few tables of people in the whole place, we decided to sit at the bar in hopes of faster service. Upon sitting down there was dirty dishes left on the bar that looked like they had been there awhile. The buser quickly came over and cleaned up and brought us chips and dips (he was probably the most attentive person in this place). We had to flag the bar tender down to get drinks (mind you there was only 2 other people at the bar). The drinks were horrible. No Tabasco on hand for a bloody Mary and no oranges for the blue moon they have on tap... really you have Blue Moon on tap and no oranges? I had to ask the bartender 3 times for a water, the last time she said "ya sure", then walked in back for 5 minutes... The fourth time my boyfriend finally asked her for my water and had her remake me something to drink as the bloody Mary was unbearable. We then had to ask for menus, and also had to ask her to take our order.... I mean what is your job if I as the customer am doing all the work??!!! The manager brought our plate out, it was cold. The food was mediocre at best... what a disappointment especially for the price. My boyfriend asked the bartender for silverware which she said "oh yeah sure" then walked off and did something else. I told him not to even remind her and see if she will ever bring it. Nope we ended up sharing silverware. We spoke with the manager when we left about how poor the service was, he didn't seem to care much just staring at us with a blank expression. So that is if for us we will not be back! So sad that we use to love this place and it has gone down the drain so much!The food was amazing and nicely proportioned, but the service was horrible. Right when we walked in, no greetings and we were ignored. I had to approach the host and tell him how many were in our party. Then my family and I got an attitude from a few employees. They were very rude  and had horrible attitudes. It was so bad that my 7yr old asked whats wrong with them. I  understand if someone has a bad day. But customers should NEVER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!!!Very disappointed!! We ordered 2 cerviche    tostadas, carne asada taco, and a grilled and breaded fish taco. When we were being rung up we were told there would be a .75 cent charge to use our credit card. The cashier wasn't friendly and quite rude when we asked for help with the menu. When we asked for chips she said that would be an additional $2.00. When the chips came they were cold and gross. Our food came out in two separate orders and lacked flavor. There was hardly any meat on the tacos. When we left I asked for a refill on my Coke and the cashier told me it  would be another full soda charge. We were expected to bus our own table for this lack luster overpriced food. Sorry won't be going back!!I first dined here about a year ago and was really disappointed in wasn't going to go back; however, my wife had a coupon from some coupon book and I went to go get some takeout to watch Sunday football. First of all, the service in this restaurant sucks. There's laid-back and then there is rude-they are rude. I finally get to the counter to order and the girl is drinking a soda and eating her breakfast on the cashier counter. She said to me, "what do you want?" And didn't even give me I contact. I probably should just walked out right then and known better, but I didn't. I ordered street tacos and they were an absolute joke. The worst of it was the Pasole which really was void of taste, however, the worst part or all the cartilage in bones that were in there. Now I understand that you need that in there for flavor when making Pasole because I make that soup frequently. When I pulled out the bones and the cartilage it amounted to about the size of a tennis ball. The flavor of it was really Bland and overall just not good. Good thing I found rather interesting was that they charge $.75 anytime that you make a non-cash transaction. That's just ridiculous.The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.....low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup...my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that they did have good service...very friendly....My first toime there will be my last!!!I just will NOT eat here anymore. Tonight was the breaking point for my family at Nando's. 

We live close by and have come here often over the last couple years but continually have come away not feeling well after eating. The chips/salsa is good but the food is so damn SALTY and GREASY!!!. 

My wife ordered a plate of grilled vegies to try and eat healthy...they came out looking brown and slippery cause of all the soy sauce and butter. She even requested to have them cooked with low salt and low butter...didn't help. 

They smoother many of the dishes in so much cream cheese and cheddar that you know your belt will fit tighter the next day. We ordered the chicken taco pizzza from here a while back and both of us threw up VIOLENTLY that night. My wife was so sick she had to go to urgent care and get hooked up on an IV. This is a true story. 

Even a simple muchaca burro, not deep fried, isn't clean or healthy. It is so SALTY you can't get the sodium taste out of your mouth for hours later. GUESS WHAT...Nando...yes the man who created the restaurant...he recently had a QUADRUPLE BYPASS HEART SURGERY...because he "liked his food salted heavy" and probably greasy too.. This was explained to me by the people who work at Nando's. This is true facts. 

The food does taste good here for the first bite or two, but then it just makes you feel bad when you leave. Sorry Nando's, I have thrown you away. My body rejects you.Eeeewwww!!! Not only did they mess up my pick up order, the food was gross. Got the salsa but NO CHIPS! The 3 hostesses rudely pointed me to the BAR to pick up my food, only to be waiting forever to be called in... What a joke. Got home and what I ordered was not IN MY BAG, starving I tried to eat it anyway....yuck. Blobs of cheese, tacos burned to a crisp (that's a first) enchiladas were runny ( not with cheese) disgusting!!! I ate here before , never a problem. I don't know if they had an off day or what. But $30 worth of take out food should be at least satisfactory...... This was NOT.Wow, I'm still the only person that doesn't like this place?? I don't get it. What am I missing? Oh I know... FLAVOR. 

Gave this place a 2nd try and was even more disappointed than the first time. Got a breakfast burrito with eggs, beans, cheese (supposedly), and green chilies. I may as well have had a piece of cardboard. Seriously, NO FLAVOR. I poured their salsa and hot sauce all over it and I barely noticed it (they use the word "hot" very liberally). 

Perhaps if I ate meat other than chicken I'd like the food here, but both the chicken burrito I had the first time and the breakfast burrito I had today were tasteless, so 2 strikes and you're out on this one.Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!I opened the door and was greeted by the f-word.  I guess it was the owner (waxed mustache) was going on about some story of his band.  Every sentence had a f and or s-bomb spoken quite loudly.   The guy would have been obnoxious and offensive in a bar at closing time.  At noon on Sunday it was inexcusable.  I won't be going in again.What a disappointment this place has become.  I think they have forgotten their local roots and become way to commercialized.  I visited most recently and was severely disappointed.  Not only in the overall condition of the grounds but the fact that it is clear their sole motivation is to make a $. 

They have a country store and it is very misleading, you think the majority of the good sold would be local, however this is not the case. If you look closely most of it is packaged or produced outside of Arizona or Queen Creek and then they put their own label on it.  I would expect more from a "local" farming family.  

I think the concept of the family farm is good and I commend them for their long heritage in the area. I just think they have lost sight of the bigger picture and the values that one time made them so successful.  Big is not always better. I think they would be better off concentrating on a select few events or amenities, rather than try and have so much and with so little quality.This course has an ok layout and a couple holes with nice views, however it doesn't make up for a rude staff that pushed us every other hole to keep a faster pace. They talked down to us and were being rude. Not even one "hello, are you having a good time?"  No courtesy at all, just rudeness. On a Sunday early morning we maintained a 4 1/2 hr pace while having to search for our balls in monsoon casual water collection areas and high rough. We let a 3 some play through and were not pushed much from behind, yet the staff kept harrassing us and threatening to make us skip a hole. What?? I have never had this experience at another course even if there was slow play that day.  Here, it wasn't even crowded yet they kept annoying us. What an unenjoyable day and waste of gas money to drive all the way out there.  Never again.  The 1 star is just for 3 nice holes on the mountainside, otherwise i'd try giving negative stars.I have never, NEVER given a Holiday Inn a one star rating. However, this places stinks! It's dirty. When we walked in, we immediately noticed smudges on the mirrors and a dire need for a fresh paint of coat on just about everything. The sheets had a weird smell, but I'm sure they were clean, albeit poorly. The tub barely drained; I had to keep turning it off before continuing my shower because I was standing in a pool of water. Personally, that grosses me out, but that could be just me. It is also worth mentioning that I take quick showers...

The people are nice and the blueberry muffins at the breakfast buffet are really good. This is odd for a Holiday Inn Express, so while I will continue to stay at this chain, I will not return to this location.We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18% gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back.We went to Sidelines on Friday, Sept. 28, 2012. We  had a coupon from entertainment.com and showed to to our waitress. She said the coupon was valid and we could use it for what we ordered. We ordered fish & chips and a fish sandwich meal which was mediocre at best. After we ate and received the bill the waitress told us due to the computer not accepting our coupon we had to pay full price on the bill. It would have been nice to know this beforehand. The excuse about the computer was a pretty lame excuse. Definitely would not recommend.Zero stars would be more appropriate. Came in for burger and wings, was one of two tables of customers. Food was terrible, took 45 minutes to get out, the people that ordered after us were served 15 minutes before us. When I paid the check the waitress ran around for 40 minutes with my credit card. Every time i pass this place i wonder how the doors stay open.I hate to write anything negative, however my experience here was a BAD one. I went in and asked for a stacked a line cut but ended up leaving in tears with gaps in the hair on the back of my head. The guy who did my hair was very rough with me, constantly throwing my head around. I would not recommend this place if you want a very specific hair cut.GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I submitted 6 button down shirts and a year old Ralph Lauren suit. They lost 3 shirts, but only told me they lost 2. Weeks later while I was submitting my claim they found my shirts. The worst part was my suit had a small hole on the back of the jacket. I had to let them know how much the suit was first to submit my claim and when I did I expected to be reimbursed. I received a check for $7.95 and a $5.00 store credit. The suit was about $700 so I thought they made a mistake, but no. The letter they sent included a brochure about how insects can cause holes in suits and that was the reason for the hole and the responsibility was mine. I have never experienced a hole in ANY of my clothes, EVER, and the suit did NOT have a hole when I turned it in. I was outraged when I spoke with one of the owners of the company, who treated me like a child and told me life isn t fair. Unless you want to deal with a company who has insects that can ruin your clothes, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.Ashley Manor committed to a memorial service and then after we sent out the evites and planned the event they pulled the plug saying they were over committed. Unbelievable!! Under no circumstance should this have happened.  If they can't book properly how can the do anything properly.  I am appauled. Do not use this venue under any circumstance.Worst nail experience I've ever had!  He cut them shorter then they should have been cut and  I asked for "squareish" cut on my nails, so they'd be rounded on edges, but there was no rounding.  After I had paid, before he put polish on them, I said they still needed to be rounded and he said it was too late....and he meant it!  My pedicure left me with skin hanging off two toes - not trimmed well.  Very little interaction with me during the hour I was there and the tools didn't look clean.  I will never return...and would advise you go elsewhere if you want quality work!Good Eggs Benedict, actually the best I have had in the Scottsdale area. Service on the other end, very poor. The orders at the time of service, March 10th around 1:30 pm were very slow and the employees were very rude. I would not say I am a regular but I try to make it out there twice a month, but I was treated very poorly. For example, we bought two drinks and we filled up with two sodas. While sitting at the table the cashier came up and said I charged you for a water and soda, "I need two dollars for you" (In a tone I am unable to duplicate). I understand business is business and every dollar counts, however I disagree with her approach to it. I gave her the two dollars and walked out leaving our meals untouched. Goldman's lost my patronage over the disrespect and dirty looks from their cashier.Scum bag owners could care less.
Details at this place are a joke they almost make the car worse-
dirty water for shampoo over worked under payed detailers could care less. Slow pathetic washes etc a bunch of lowlife managers 
employed by the lowlife owners.Worst customer service and pushy commissions based employees anywhere I have ever seen! Terry, is the absolute worst. Beware of this guy! Had a exchange with him where I was forced to file charges with the Salt River Police Department against him. He was cursing and threatening myself and other customers in a manner unacceptable by any standards. His boss Rich, stated to me that this individual (Terry) would be terminated/fired for his unacceptable and unprofessional behavior. He is still working at AZ car wash!! Rich (the mgr.) was also very unprofessional and will say anything to the customer to try to salvage their business. Do not trust anything said by Rich. He is full of it. The employee Terry is a felon with a long criminal record. Do not hesitate to call the police if you are confronted by either of these 2 individuals. Both the Scottsdale Police and Salt River police know this carwash well. Once I filed charges, the police officer told me that a large number of complaints constantly comes in by customers who were threatened by employees at this car wash....they are there all the time.
I strongly recommend you do not pay any money upfront to this car wash. When I requested a refund on a detailing (due to threats I received from Terry), they informed me that their carwash cannot process refunds to customers. Really!! I immediately proceeded to my bank and filed a fraud claim against this establishment.
Your car will take forever to be cleaned and the cleaning is only marginal at best. Their employees are overworked and the attitude of this facilities management as well as an extremely poor attitude by the cashier (Gordo) led me to cancel all future work at AZ Car Wash at the Scottsdale pavilion location. 
Even after securing an agreement on the cost to clean and detailed my cars, this carwash continued to ask for additional monies whatever my car came in for a wash.
Beware of this facility!! Read the other reviews on this and other sites......this is the worse carwash in Phoenix!!!Don't stay here. Stayed 2 nights. No hot water. Room stunk with a sickly sweet smell. Rust on the bathtub and stains on the lampshade. 6 noisy air conditioner compressors outside the window. They did not care.Nothing really to do with the service there but when I got gas an paid at the pump it charged my debit card $100 hold fee... I called an they said that's what the pay at the pumps there do, we'll post a big sign!My husband and I had reservations for our anniversary last weekend. When we arrived we were informed that we had to wait for our table to become available. So we waited....and waited.....and waited.  We waited for almost an hour--the hostesses made no attempt to apologize and were rude when we inquired how much longer we would have to wait. Finally we were seated. Then, we waited and waited again...this time for someone to serve us. No one approached our table. Another couple seated after us were served immediately... My husband and I finally got tired of waiting and  left the restaurant. Don't waste your time and money on this place....there are too many other good choices in Scottsdale. I was so disappointed that our special anniversary dinner didn't happen...I won't be back and I will not be recommending this restaurant to my friends.Poor customer service- I called ahead of time to make an appointment. She told me to come in there was not a wait. I get there 10 minutes later and she tells me I now have to wait a half hour since they got busy in those 10 minutes. Wasn't that the reason I called ahead. I will not be returning....if you like having enough salt on your pizza to kill a full grown horse, this is your kind of pizza.... I will never eat there again. The owner made no effort to compensate for the worst pizza I have ever eaten. Sorry, there are far better places in Scottsdale to get a pizza than this "joint".Came to the Silverado grille at about 430pm  in the afternoon and restaurant.com and yelp both wrote that they were open at this time but apparently they say close at 4pm. Leah the bartender/server was very nice and tried to accommodate me but the cook Zack was unhelpful. Even though I said that I drove all the way over here,  he still wouldn't cook anything at all. Very disappointing. Will not be back.If my Jewish grandmother lost all of her passion for living and then opened up a restaurant, this is what the food would taste like.Chompie's, based on my three visits, is very unfriendly to children, and I'm speaking of well-behaved 11 year olds, not crying babies.I want to clarify that the Tatum and Cactus location is great, but this one really needs help. First, the service was horrendous. Young people who are clueless as far as serving goes.  Is this a training location for their employees???? Come on, folks. And...vacuuming the carpet while customers are eating is just gross. Going back to the bathroom, I noticed a stench and a big hole in the ceiling. What is going on with this location??? Thirty minutes after eating, I had to visit the bathroom with urgency. This is unacceptable for a Chompies. Get with the *&^(%(!  program folks.We tried to buy an EGift Card on Houston's website. It was a HORRIFIC experience. We purchase restaurant gift cards for our clients regularly and have NEVER had this trouble. A very unprofessional person named Cait Cameron was snippy, condescending and completely unhelpful. We had used our P.O. Box for our corporate credit card, and instead of merely asking us for our physical address, she cancelled our gift card and then treated us as if we were felons. Why someone so nasty has been chosen by Houston's to have a prominent position in their customer service division is beyond me! We are still trying to reach her supervisor, Paige Purcha. We have heard that Houston's food is good, but their Customer Service is egregious!Having been regulars for the past 10 years, last spring, my family and I went to eat there for a celebration. We were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant. There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal. The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so, for me, I settled for a mushroom burger. We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was "helping" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water. We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking. I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly, functioned restaurant.On average, I eat at ten restaurants a week.  In my life, I have never experienced such utter disdain for the wishes of the customer as I witnessed last night.  My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way.
Here is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was "we can't do that".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was "we can't do that".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was "we can't do that".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.
The fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.  
That's good for me, bad for you.Horrible job. I got a mani/pedi and I could have done a better job myself. I know sometimes they can accidently cut your skin, but she took a huge chunk out of my cuticle then tried telling me I had a hang nail.... um I think not idiot. The paint job was horrible... the whole nail wasn't even covered. Pricing was alright, service horrible.Everytime I go into this store, there is only one cashier working but yet several employees meandering around?  Today was the same!!  But the worst was the POOR customer service I received.  I used to love this store as they do have a large variety of kids toys etc. After my freadful experience today, I wil never walk through those doors again.  Waiting over 20 mins in check out line is not acceptable.The fact that Bashas is still even in business both astounds and frightens me.Please think twice before you stay here...we booked our suite on the internet and thought we were getting a good rate, we checked in and stayed for a couple of nights then on check out we find out they raised our daily rates!  Fortunately, we brought our confirmation ( which includes the rate)with us...at first they were not going to adjust the rate until we asked for a manager then they made the adjustment!!!  They told us the rate went up the day after we checked-in...shady business practice!  The place is out dated, the 2 hour reception (Manager's Reception) is over-rated...the line is long with only one person pouring for all those people and they use cheap alcohol so you are sure to have a hang-over the next day!  The Breakfast is okay...don't expect to get an omelett.  Oh yes,  we were told we were getting a king bed and ended up with two queens.  We will never go here again!We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.  

Not to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was.ATTENTION- SEE BELOW. BUT I WANT THIS 1 STAR BACK!

I have eaten at this establishment quite a few times over the years ever since they opened. I would have breakfast meetings here, take the girls softball team here after games and other events. We thought it was a good place to suggest 3 of my friends join me last night. after a long day of diving over 900 miles in one shot and loading and off loading a 25 foot moving truck, we wanted a change from the spots along the highway.

My first impression when we walked in the door was it smelled like a greasy sewer. I headed to the rest room to wash my hands. It was gross and the rest room was even worse. I even noticed little deodorizers like the ones in the urinals in some unusual places outside the restroom. Humm. Makes you wonder!

We sat and waited for others to join us. We were parked in the second to the east corner booth, by the kitchen door and milk shake machine. We were hungry and tired. Once our party joined us, we ordered.  It was not a complex or difficult order.... 3 french toast orders and I had small diner salad, half tuna and soup of the day. 

The place was far from busy and most other patrons were already eating. It took every bit of 25 minutes or more to get our food. The server Mike (receipt said a different foreign name)  had no clue how to serve, never brought us our utensils, forgetting parts of the order. 

But the part I am really complaining and disgusted about and warning to others has to deal with what we all witnessed crawling all around us.

 First, while we were waiting for our food, I watched a roach, yes roach, la cucaracha, crawl on the wall under the counter bar where you can sit. He cruised all around there. Several in our party were somewhat grossed out. Still waiting on our food, a second person in our party notices another one on the floor under the table (booth) adjacent to us where a nice family of 5 were sitting. We did not want to start a panic and said nothing. Ok, this is getting a bit freaky. Then, just before our food came, the more squeamish in our group of us male outdoorsmen, sees a third one behind me, crawling up the wall. That did it. Several told the waiter to return the food to the kitchen and get the manager while the others 2 ate with reluctance.  

Bottom line, if you want a marginal meal served in a piss poor manner in a smelly environment, with a triple side of roaches, you got to try this place. By the way,  we were compt our meal and tipped our server a little something but this place has lost what amounts to or will amount to 50 patrons. adios la cucarachas!Wow. I'm really appalled to hear about the customer service issues people have been having here.  It's truly sad when a business owner feels the need to insult his/her customers.
But, that didn't happen to me..

the coffee happened to me.  This place is called "romancing the bean" as if it's supposed to be a coffee shop.  But they should probably rebrand it as a lunch cafe for the suits that work in the building. Maybe renaming it.... "For us, by us"  or "Tons of Pastries" 

Anyway... I went there one day with a friend.  She ordered an americano, and I a mocha.  We were promptly served, and sat down to watch the school aged girl (10 years old?)  work as I had a server on a school day.   What is that all about?!

It only took a glance into the cup to realize that we had crap handed to us.  

My mocha was gritty and disgusting.  Probably from using low quality chocolate (maybe even chocolate powder! Yuck).  

Her americano was looking bad, the espresso crema was almost non existant, and after a scorching sip, we both realized that they have no idea how to use their espresso machine.  

We threw away our drinks, and headed to cartel.

To anyone interested in coffee, please drive a few minutes down the road to any other coffee shop in the area.  Cartel is south, Open Source is east, Sola is north, and even Starbucks is right around the corner on mill.I went in for 2 tires. They had to be ordered.  A week passed. The guy who originally helped me said he miss dialed my number so that's why  I never got a call that y they were in . So one week later after I paid for my tires I called and that was what I was told. Okay strike one. Then as I was driving home from work my tires were shaking do to not be balanced. I took it back and had scheduled another appt.  Got there and had no appt and was told sorry and it maybe mud causing shaking. Waited.. What really!!? Strike 2. Then when I got home I noticed my caps were missing from my stock tires, I was then told there's no way they would have lost any thing. The way he said it made me so upset. Who trys to get free tire caps... then I went back and finally they were ok. Waited.. They asked if I was interested in buying new tires for the front wheels. Ummmm no!!!! The guy who helped at the beginning and end was helpful anyone else no thanks. Would I go back , not with out my husband.I feel bad for the people who get suckered into this place after seeing their photoshopped pictures online.  This place is on par with a Days Inn, and is by no means a resort.

My issue was the ownership and staff.  If you want to feel like you are the biggest inconvenience to walk through the front door, then this is your place! Also, I have no idea how their gym survives. They discourage gym-only membership and the fees are ridiculous ($549 initiation fee, plus $100 monthly fee).  I guess that's why the place is completely dead. Oh well, the equipment is old anyways.  

Anyways, this place is a big NOPE! Nope nope nopeUnbelievable that a "egg" restarunt does not know how to poach an egg. 3x for eggs benedict and still wrong. 2xs eggs not cooked 3x killed them. I gave up.I like the layout of the store but the prices are what is ridiculous for me anyways . In my opinion you would be far better off goin to Fresh and Easy or Sunflower Market which is down the street for produce if you want quality cheaper food with the knowledge of  knowing that it is fresh. Much of what you buy at safeway is strictly on supply and demand basis and  even know it says ORGANIC doesn't  mean it is certified unless it has the name Kosher or Certified Organic by the FDA label on the back of the product  . So this marketing tactic couldn't be further from the truth. The high prices are however another outrageous factor . They mark down the prices to give the illusion that customer is saving money by means of a club card ,  but the reality of the situation couldn't be further from the truth . You could go to any competitiors and realize they charge and over amout just for basic products . Other stores  don't charge the ridiculous prices that this safeway and similar safeway stores charge . The fact is that they are coporation they have to come up with creative minipulative ideas to "Get Over" on the customer . Save yourself the shock and deception and go SunFlower Market and Fresh and Easy .The eye doctor seems to rush through his exams and isn't very thorough. Ordered contacts and when I picked them up they were the wrong prescription. I almost walked out door with wrong prescription. Watched as the two front clerks played the blame game.."I didn't put that order in". They did give me a spare set but still have to make another trip back to doctor in hopes my order will be right.I know I won't get any freebies on this review but who cares. Truth is more valuable.
I dropped in last night. It was the cheeziest get together I've ever experienced.  Filled with people who don't know how to socialize, sad faces abounded, appeared to be a park and swap gig with cheap jewelry on tables for sale.!   The way 90% of these patrons were dressed, astonished me! OMG. Cheap cheap and quack quack!  I should of known hwen I noticed the cars in the parking lot, I've not  seen  so many old cars and trucks, since  I attending the Park and Swap experience. The drinks (wine) is so bad, you can expect to spend most your time 'later; in the bathroom with diareaha, either from the cheap beverages they serve or the nasty germs they have in this place....I would rather mow my lawn than frequent this establishment again...off to Montelucia, El Choro, & Ocean Club which are much better places to spend your money and time and eyes loking at the crowds.  Look for my lates reviews every Saturday mornings!Unfortunately I cannot honestly give Shane co a good review. My boyfriend bought my setting for my engagement ring here, everything was good, layaway went smooth, and picked it up....

Now here comes the issue he found the diamond he wanted online, went to the store asked if they could order it in and no change in price. They told him it was no problem made sure it was available. They then proceeded to show him less quality and NOT GIA certified diamonds. Half hour after they try and convince him that diamond is not what he wants,and  about how you want inclusions so you can identify your diamond, he still wanted the one he found online. So they went to the back ordered it and he put a large payment on it until it arrived. Well no word comes of it being recieved, so at this point he calls and no one returns his call. Next day gets a call well that diamond must have accidentaly been sold... Basically it came down to they did not want to sell it at the price that is was online. (which was according to them alot less that it was supposed to be) So after trying and pushing him to buy something less quality for more we found somewhere else. Not only did we get a reasonable price they explained everything to us and did not treat us like nobodies.  Granted Derek called us back but why after being screwed over and tried being talked out of what we wanted would you go back?? 
 
I wouldnt.

Try Crown Fine Jewlery, Chris and Rosalee are amazing, and communication is beyond words!Mmmmmk so I went to Shane Co 

Staff are stuck up and to busy to help you. Will I go back nope no noppie.Meh... Went in on a Tuesday morning at 10:30 to get my ring repaired.  Walked around for a while. All the sales reps were busy. I'm fine with waiting, but common customer service is to at least acknowledge you see a customer with, "we'll be right with you.".Giving this one star is being nice. Absolutely dreadful food and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. At one point we had to get up and walk across the restaurant to get our watiress's attention just to refill our water glass. When we finally did get our food, it was bland and uninspired. Started with the wings, they were overcooked and too chewy. They only gave us one little cup of ranch for 8 wings and when we asked for more they said they had to charge us. I got the burger and it was ok but I have had much better at even fast food restaurants. My girlfriend got some salad that was dry, so to cover that up they drenched it in dressing. It was inedible, we sent it back. The best part about that is they still tried to charge us for it on the bill. We had to argue for about 20 min to get it off. First with the waitress, then the asst manager, and finally the general manager. Was charging us $11 for a salad we had two bites of really worth ruining a customer's experience? I guess to this establishment it is. The main reason we went was to watch a game and I was so turned off with them trying to nickel and dime us, I left in the third quarter and went to the zipp's up the street. Good setup with the tvs, but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy.I've been coming here my whole life and now the prices are too high and the portions are smaller. *frowny face*I used to love the Good Egg. My husband and I were regulars but after the ratio of bad meals went from 1 out of 10 to 5 out of 10 then 9 out of 10, we're done. 

The service is lousy: If they mess-up or forget your order, you get nothing more than a half apology. 

The food is bland and poorly cooked: Their eggs are unseasoned and sauces are made from powder mix. Their poached eggs are watery making whatever they put them on a runny mess.

Their prices are high and getting higher: Many dishes $10 and no longer come with potatoes. You have to buy your side for an additional $1. Their not-so-clever attempt to raise prices without anyone noticing is insulting to our intelligence.

I am casting my vote to stop bad breakfast in Arizona. I will never eat at Good Egg again. They need to go out and make room for people who actually care about putting out a good plate of food.I had a good experience at the one in Chandler, but this one is a dive. We found hair in our food and our waitress was mostly unseen. I'll never be coming back to this location. There was nothing good about my experience.The place I tried was on union hills, absolutely terrible..pizza was over done, wings were bad and I felt like a fool spending $30.00 there for a terrible product.I bought a gift certificate for a friend for a cooking class for us both to attend. We misplaced the gift certificate and just found it over a year later.  Thinking it would not be a big deal I called and spoke with the owner/ manager who assured me she would not honor it nor did she have time to discuss it and hung up on me. I could not believe how rudely I was treated and before I had time to ask if there was another class I could get for us she hung up.  Not sure what her name is but whoever you are (owner) I will tell everyone I know and post how you treated me on every social network I can.  You should be ashamed of yourself and I have no idea how you are still in business if this is how you treat people. Worst place everAll I'm going to say about this place is that I've seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at Kierland Commons storing/preparing food back there. Items included lettuce heads, breads, and macaroni and cheese. 

DISGUSTING. I'm not making this up.  

Unfortunately, I contacted Health Services about this, and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there.

(I, along with co-workers, noticed this on the daily back in high school when I worked at Cold Stone).We were doing some shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and around Kierland and had decided to eat lunch here. I had read past reviews and had always wanted to try it. It was also really cute decor. I have been to France several times and felt they really nailed the "bistro" look so I was excited. However as soon as we walked in, the hostess immediately stopped us and explained that they have a dress code: men in tank tops are not allowed. As she's saying this, I see a family with small children wearing regular, casual clothing and another young woman dressed about as casual as you can get.  Let me preface that this was late June with temperatures over 100 on a Saturday at lunch. I can understand a dress code for dinner but lunch? Here in Phoenix? Really?? I've been to weddings where people wore flip flops. I've lived all over and phoenix is by far a very casual place because its so hot. I was pretty surprised. Granted, the hostess wasn't rude about it but I guess I didn't see the place as being that high end. Needless to say, we left and went to North instead. Their staff was incredibly friendly. What a difference. I guess Zinc is taking the French thing literally.Went here because of the good reviews.  Sorely disappointed.  Messed up on suit sleeve length twice - first time way too short, second time uneven and too long.  Finally asked for my money back. And she never apologized even though it was apparent she messed up.  Boo hiss.I ordered lunch there a few times and the roast beef sub was okay, nothing special but worth returning when I crave this sort of thing.

So, I arrived one evening at 5:45 p.m.  They close at 6:00 p.m.  I walked in and they were obviously cleaning up the entire place.  So, I kindly asked if they were closed and the two employees just looked at each other.  They did not speak to me or each other and looked like they did not know what to say so I just walked out.  

Will never return.  I got a horrible vibe like they couldn't give two craps about customer service.Overprice and not very tasty.  Had a philly that was all grilled peppers with no meat. Won't be back.Odd menu, poor choices, poorly presented. The way the food is served is strange, they give you the cooked meat, with the flavor (sauce) on the side. Good rice. I was disappointed with the menu it is very limited as far as Asian restaurants go. They have no side dishes... I mean really? What is a Chinese dinner without a few side dishes? Comfortable dining room and a nice bar. The service was marginal, the  waiters seemed confused and not familiar with the menu, even as small as it is. They scrambled and wanted to charge me for a 13 dollar dinner, just because I wanted a side of noodles. I will not go back. Disappointing if you are used to really good Chinese food. To sum it up... find another place!"BLAND" is my one word summary

1) vegetable dumplings...i'd say it was frozen then thawed out and tasted like pot stickers you'd get anywhere...the one's at Fate now those were good. (2 stars)

2) hot & sour soup was huge which is usually a good thing...but useless if it doesn't taste hot & sour at all...all I tasted was sweet & more sweet soup. (1 stars)

3) chicken vindaloo (what was I thinking ordering and indian dish at a chinese place?)  anyways probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life and tasted absolutely nothing like chicken vindaloo. (0 stars)

4) wife had vegetable fried rice...i think they forgot that we ordered everything spicy...had no flavor and i think they even forgot the soy sauce to make it fried rice (1 star)

on a positive note my wife did like the free salad and wonton chips and the service was good.  overall I wouldn't give this place another try even with all the stellar reviews.Buyer and Seller beware.  Very poor communication, arrogance, and indifference are the words that come to mind when reflecting on my experience with this company.   I am sure there are better real estate companies in the valley.  Not sure there are worse.   Debbie in the office is the only bright spot .Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return.terribleI ordered flowers from the other web site that this Florist runs called flowershop.com

The flowers were scheduled to arrive 5 days ago and still have not arrived. I spent about 90 minutes on the phone with the customer service rep on Mother's Day trying to convince her that my mother was not lying about not receiving her Mother's Day flowers. They promised me follow up delivery that day, which did not happen. I spoke to the rep a 3rd time Mother's Day evening and was told that the flowers would come on Monday. Today is Wednesday, and the flowers have still NOT arrived. 

Horrible service. Thanks for ruining Mother's Day! I will stick with 1.800flowers from now on!I met with a sales rep to discuss a quote on wedding flowers. After about 5 minutes I was basically told they couldn't help me and shown the door. She told me I could not get the flowers I wanted in April, only to be corrected by another florist that I could actually get them. Then I was quoted an outrageous price per stem that I said was way out of my budget. Instead of giving me other options and continuing with the meeting, this woman basically gave up and showed me the door. All I wanted was a reasonable quote from a florist that I was very interested in hiring but instead walked away with nothing. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! What reputable business would turn down customers who don't want to pay $22 per flower stem instead of giving them lower cost options?!AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!  I went to this dentist because his office is located very close to where I live.  Keep in mind, I'm in my 30's.  Never had a cavity in my life.  NOBODY in my family has cavities.  Up until my visit to this guy, my teeth were perfect.  

He uses this sonar wand thing that detects 'microcavities' that have yet to show up on an xray and tells me that my teeth are perfect EXCEPT for these 'microcavities'.  He scares the daylights out of me by telling me that unless I get 10 'microfillings' in my 'microcavities' they will be full blown cavities within 6 months.  Alarmed by this prediction, I set up an appointment to get 4 of these 'microfillings' put into 3 of my teeth immediately with the intention of getting the rest of my mouth done later.  I go in to get my teeth drilled on the next day and the anaesthesia he used was so strong, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack (I have had anaethesia before and it was never like this).  He proceeds to drill on my teeth and that was the beginning of my dental  problems.  For about a month and a half I suffered discomfort chewing and temperature sensitivity.  I finally call the office and complained and they tell me to come in for an 'adjustment'.  He does some more drilling and it seems a bit better, but still my teeth still don't feel the same.  A few weeks later, I notice a black dot on one of the teeth he has massacred.  I brush it and it appears to go away, however, I notice a very small cavity on that tooth that is going through the filling.  WTF?!?  I immediately make an appointment to see my old dentist (who's office is far from where I live, but has been my dentist for the last 11 years).

I tell my dentist what this guy told me and did to me and I come to find out the 'microfillings' were COMPLETELY UNECESSARY!!!  My dentist just shook his head and said 'that's too bad'.  Everyone has small fissures in their teeth.  They are a cause for concern if you are a teenager, but for mature adults who maintain good dental hygiene, they are basically dormant and as long as you continue with good brushing habits, they will remain dormant.  

My old dentist proceeds to tell me that the dot I am seeing on my tooth is the result of an air bubble in the filling material that popped and exposed my drilled-on tooth to decay.  Now, after this M-F'er jacked my teeth up, I have a real cavity that is showing up on xrays.  My dentist told me I could go back to Douglas and have him fix the filling for free, I said ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IN HELL AM I LETTING THIS A-HOLE within a mile of my teeth.  I would rather pay my old dentist to fix this botch job.  Keep in mind that the reason I had this work done was because of the scare tactics he used.  Well it's been over 8 months and the 6 'microcavities' that I did not end up filling (because of my nightmare experience with the first 4) are NOT full blown cavities like I was scared into believing would happen.  In fact, the teeth on the side of my mouth that this guy did not touch are perfect.  So, now I have a real cavity in the tooth he jacked up and I have to suffer the rest of my life by being on the never ending hamster wheel of maintaining these unecessary fillings every 5 years.

So, the moral of the story is: Don't get seduced by all his high tech equipment.  Those kind of offices are all about the flash and sizzle and somebody has to pay for all that overhead and expensive equipment.  Guess what?  That somebody is YOU!  He will come up with any excuse to work on your teeth to generate revenue even if the work is COMPLETELY UNECESSARY like mine was.  If he mentions the word 'micro-filling' or 'micro-cavity' get out of your chair and RUN out of his office unless you want your mouth utterly destroyed.I have eaten at Guido's several times over the past few years and was always impressed with the food, but not so much with the service. Just recently, we visited again and we were so DISGUSTED with how bad the service was that we didn't even stay and eat this time.

For example, the waitress never came to our table initially. We had to go the front of the restaurant to try and place an order. This did not work, as we were told to go back and sit down and wait some more. I must also say that as we were waiting in line, the owner, I  presume, ignored us and spoke with some customers behind us in line, putting their orders in immediately. 

So, in the end, we waited a bit more at our table and then got up and left. Even though the service has tended to be slow and rather inattentive in the past, we have never experienced this level of rudeness before. We will not be back.I not a foodie and I don't watch the Food Network. But my job takes me all over the valley so I have to grab lunch on the run whenever I can. I stopped by Taste of Chicago this week and chose the Italian Beef. Never made it to my next appointment. 20 minutes later I ended up in the mens room of a fast food joint a few miles south on Scottsdale Road with an acute case of the runs.

I pride myself on my cast iron stomach and can't remember when I last had a case of the runs. But I shouldn't have been surprised. Environmental Services last inspected Taste of Chicago in August 2012 and found that the temperature in their walk in refrigerator was not cold enough. The inspector made them throw out all their ground beef. Coincidence? I think not.I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left.  

On a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food.All this bar cares about is your money & your money only. They do not care about individuals themselves. They willingly will treat people horribly just because they like another customer better. It is rather childish if you ask me.  There are plenty of other sports bars that have better prices, better food, better drinks, better atmosphere, and friendly employees. 
They also have a location at bell & 32nd st. I would not suggest going there either considering it is the same owner.We went the last time there was a Groupon,  and found the food horrible. The place looks tired, the portions are very small. Even with the Groupon the cost of one appetizer was $18.00 and the portion not only small, but pitiful in taste. We would recommend Millies cafe in Mesa which has excellent PUerto Rican food which is similar to Havana, however, the taste and freshness you will enjoy. Stay away from this garbage dump. The service liked the food was garbage.OK food but not worth another try.  My daughter and I tried to like this place as we are from Long Island and it is convenient to our home. Daughter Heidi ordered a bagel and it came with a small portion of cream cheese so I ordered another side of the cream cheese.  They charged a ridiculous amount for the side and when we talked to the manager he was arrogant, aloof and obnoxious telling us that was it he was not going to do anything in our favor.  The cost of the side was actually more than the bagel.  There are plenty of choices in Scottsdale and I don't recommend this one.Avoid like the plague.

Tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye, not steamed. The bread was more like a cracker, not soft fresh bread.

The pastrami was served cold.

I guess I should have known better when the server asked if  I wanted lettuce on my pastrami.


The server was brand new and just did not know...
Oh well I'm sure the bagels are ok.Average bagels, but that's not why they get one star........

The woman behind the counter who helped me, was abrasive and gross.  

As I waited for my order, I watched her eat food behind the counter, pick pieces of food out of her mouth with her bare hands, TWICE, then handle someone else's order *with her bare hands*.  Additionally, she was fairly abrasive. 

I was going to leave and abandon the order, but I had some extenuating circumstances, so I simply watched her carefully. For my order, thankfully she put on gloves.  Perhaps she noticed that I was watching her (?).

It was stunning to me that someone who works in food service would engage in such blatant unclean behavior.  Surely, this isn't the first time she's behaved like this and what the owner is thinking having such help is beyond me.What an experience! After going to this establishment for 15 years  it has officially hit rock bottom.
Drinks:  Warm Beer, Margeritas devoid of tequila.  Asked for a cold glass took 10 minutes to get it to me.
Beans: pinto DRY, Black beans under-cooked and cold
Rice:  No taste and under cooked
Burritos:  Chicken inside was excellent. 
Decor:  OLD and needs a redo and cheesy.
Workers:  Mostly teenagers with no management. 
Prices: Cheap but that's all its worth
Summary:  Its day has come and gone!Joined on a groupon, went once and never went back.  Gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s.  
Tennis courts filled with rug rats and people who did not want to give way to anyone else wanting to hit.  Heated pool, big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that.  My expectations were not met, very disappointed.Went there today, Saturday at 4:30 in the afternoon and they were closed.  Their store hours sign says open Saturday from 10:00ish to 6:00ish.  I swear to god, I've never seen anything like it.  I had to take a picture I couldn't believe it.  Even though I live around the corner, I will go out of my way to avoid a place that disrespects its customers like that.  Set your hours and stick to them.We always have enjoyed going to Olive Garden in the past and this experience really changed my opinion of Olive Garden all together. We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and really were looking forward to having a great experience as always. The bread-sticks are tasty, the salads and soups are always a pleasure to try since they seem to always have new ones coming out from time to time. But my issue is with the management and because of that our experience has tarnished Olive Garden in our eyes. 

Our server comes over and asks us for drinks. I have a glass of wine and my husband has a Italian margarita. We order our app and  a salad and my husband finishes his margarita and our server asks him if  he would like another. He agrees and asks her to order in another shot of tequila because the first margarita was a little light. She says okay and when she comes back with his margarita following right behind her is the Manager and asks him why he wants an additional shot, he explains and the GM then goes on long explanation on why they cant add additional shots in the drink and said moving forward tonight we are not going to be serving you any more alcoholic drinks.

 I was shocked! Two drinks and you are cut off. Maybe the manager was having a bad day, or maybe they only let you order two drinks. But this coming from a place where they are always pushing their wine and always go as far to leaving you a whole jug of it at your table this came off as a little odd.  My husband is a good sized man and two drinks and cut off I thought was a little too much. Most importantly this was rude and unprofessional.

This ruined our evening and it was very difficult for us to take anything positive from this. Since our order was in we waited for our entrees, ate them, paid the bill and left. I can honestly say that we are never coming back to Olive Garden in the future. 

I went online the next day and filled in the contact us questionnaire so that we could be contacted by someone at corporate and let someone know how not to treat customers that have been so loyal for so many years now but to this day I have yet to be contacted back, not an email or a call. What a disappointment where customer service goes such a long way. Apparently not to Olive Garden!On 01/02 - I took my 6 yr old grandson on his birthday to have a celebratory lunch.  I specifically inform the waitress there just that. First, after receiving our order [I had soup and salad and he had a pepperoni pizza], we never saw the waitress again until we were done - so to speak.  I say that because the pizza was so undercooked, he could not eat it.  So he had my soup.  The waitress finally came back and asked if we wanted the pizza boxed up.  I informed her the pizza was undercooked and to let the cook know.  No apologies, no nothing from her.  She then asked if the birthday boy would like a birthday dessert.  Of course, what little boy wouldn't?  So she brings over a menu for him to choose his dessert.  In the meantime, I noted on the table if you bought a $50 gift card, you would get a free $10 bonus card.  I informed my waitress that I wanted a $50 gift card.  After they brought my grandson his candle-lit dessert and sang happy birthday to him, I received my gift card, but not the bonus.  After inquiring about it, they stated that promotion was no longer running, even though the promotion advertisement was still on the table, and it did not state a date to when the promotion ended.  After speaking with the manager, he "graciously" gave me a $10 gift card.  I say graciously, because he certainly had an attitude about it.  But the kick to all of this, not only was I charged for an uncooked pizza my 6 year old grandchild could not eat, I was charged for his birthday dessert?  Who does that?  Who charges a birthday dessert for a 6 year old child?

Needless to say, we will never go back to that location.Dr. Bassett charges to reset crowns that fail in 3 years, and doesn't appear to think that is unusual. Most dentists I've spoken with since leaving her practice guarantee crowns for at least 5 years. If you can afford her emergency fees plus the cost of replacing your crowns ($2000 a tooth) every few years, plus deal with her attitude, you will be very happy with this dentist.I can't even give it one star because the people that take your money are mean. Yes I agreed that I'm not a pro gambler, but I'm not a sore loser either. I spent lots gambling and had a bad experience with Jennifer and grandma. The more you spend the worst the casino treats you. I would recommend the bar because prie treats you awesome and her staff.Had to go to this PetSmart to get a couple emergency chew toys for my new puppy. Overall, store is very clean. Stopped at the veterinarian counter, I believe its Banfield owned to ask about purchasing puppy shots to administer to my puppy myself...Staff was extremely rude and answered with "I wouldn't know anything about and we don't sell the shots to people here, we vaccinate for you." Not to mention they don't like my breed (pitbull) even though she is nicer than any animal I have seen walk through their doors.  

Then, I just went back to rent a Bissell and upon checking one out was almost given one with a broken canister. Then after exchanging that out brought a second one home only to find that the bottom was beyond filthy. I have posted pictures of the machine before I cleaned it and after. I spent almost 2 hours taking the bottom of the machine apart, including all the screws, to clean out the hair and other garbage that was not cleaned from the customer before. Maybe I am wrong but I think things you rent should be returned in better condition then when you borrowed them. Anyways moral to the story is make sure you check out the machine before you rent it. Including the under side of it. I brought it to the attention of an associate at this location and I think she was a little taken aback. Maybe she was embarrassed or just didn't care but I told her she should probably relay the info to other people checking these in to ensure they are returned and cleaned as they are supposed to be before the deposit is refunded. 

Enough of that soap box. Normal corporate store like every other PetShart.I have held this petsmart location in high regard, I use their doggie day care, I have used there puppy training classes and I have purchased 90% of my pet supplies from here. Today I returned an item and was given a gift card, before I had even left the store I had managed to lose the gift card (I know it was my fault I dropped the gift card). I returned to the register and the cashier and I looked for the gift card to no avail. The cashier then asked the manager if with my receipt I could be reissued the gift card. The manager said I was out of luck, he was not even willing to get out of his chair. 

Key point: the day manager is a slovenly, rude man who has no common courtesyI cannot believe they are still in business.  1st time I went no one waits on you finally they got me a flat beer then a tough filly cheese steak with hunks of uneatable fat.  Complained refused to go back finally after a year I go 2nd time the steak was fine and cold fries no napkin no fork no dish begged for a check takes them a long time to make change can't  count shorted me a dollar thats ok I tipped them anyway.  Wen back again 3rd time took a while for the food bar mades were talking with more important friends then the customers took a very long time to get their attention.  This was officially my last time there ever.  My friend went about a few months ago got seated and never waited on so he walked out the greeters did say "thanks for coming see you soon."  They got that part down.  If at all cost avoid this establishment unless you are a friend of theirs they will spend time serving you correctly.Snottiest, most arrogant office I have ever been to.  After waiting 90 minutes past our appointment time, without so much as an "I'm sorry we are running late" or "would you like a glass of water?",  some snotty woman comes out and lectures us about how special his excellency is and how we should all be good little boys and girls.   

Find another office!!!!I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.Actually walked out of this restaurant after waiting 20 minutes and no servers had even acknowledge we had been seated, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all!  A first for both me and my husband!We went to this place just so the kids could have some fun desert. I had been there a couple times before my kids were born (about 10+ years ago) and i thought we had a good experience, but things have changed now - for the worse. Place seems to be frequented by the rich old scottsdale clientele that arrive in their mercedes's and don't mind throwing 100bucks on what i would say is - mediocre food - and whats with being attended by snobbish waiters. We had one that barely showed up for taking the order, we could not get water on the table for a good 20 mins and had to ask the neighboring waiter - who also seemed to forget us - only when we called another waiter across the table did we get some water. The way it works is - you get a bunch of fruits and cookies and other dippers that you can dip in a bowl of molten chocolate. When the waiter showed up - he reminded us that if everyone on the table had a plate, we would have to pay 9$ each. I am not sure why he said that - as if we would not be able to afford it or something. I know the desert is overpriced  - but i m there with my family to have a good time. Take the order and bring back some food - and should not be too hard to smile when you do that. Anyways, he took the order and disappeared. Showed up after a while and had two plates - i was like - i just ordered food for all on the table - why skimp? i did not make a fuss - we still made sure the kids enjoyed and i still paid him the 20% gratuity- which he did not deserve. Piss poor service with mediocre food. Sad. I don't generally give out reviews, let alone bad ones, but i was not happy here.Worst. Experience. Ever.

I went in to buy a new phone. They told me they didn't have it there and would have to order it. I wasn't too happy about this but they  told me it would be "like 2 to 4 days."  I ordered a phone on December 1st and, after tons of phone calls that *I* made (they never bothered to check in or call me), it finally came in on the 21st.

While I understand this was in part due to the phones being on back order (how can you not know that if you work at a phone store??), it was still a huge hassle for me and they didn't and WOULDN'T give me anything for my ordeal. They could have thrown in some screen protectors or something and I would have been satisfied. But the girl didn't offer, and when I asked it was just "sorry." I was also told they could get me a better deal on my plan. Did they? Nope. She didn't even try. 

I hope to God I never have to deal with these people ever again, and I will tell anyone I meet never to go there. Ridiculous.Don't make your customers walk to the back of the store to get your own brand of water! Fry's in Phoenix puts plenty of water cases in the front of the store! It's a DESERT!!I went for my first time to this nail salon and I will never go back.  The woman who did my nails talked the entire time to other manicurists in Vietnamese or whatever which in itself is rude and makes one feel paranoid that they are being talked about.  That would have been tolerable if the manicure itself had been worth it but it was a terrible manicure that lasted two days at most and some nails are are chipping and jagged already. I am a once a week client of manicures so my nails have been very well taken care of- until this week.Worst Breakfast Burrito for too much money.  For $9 - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla.   I told them not to add ham because I read on their web site before I drove over that there was bacon.  No bacon and could not taste the cheese.   I asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it...  "we only put in 2 eggs"  Well it was one too many.   The salsa was the horrible NYC type.   We are too close to the border for that. It was nice and hot though.Rude management and office staff, very slow response times from maintenance team (if they came at all), and ridiculous charges at move-out. Thankfully I was able to talk them out of the extra charges, since they were based on nonsense. The complete lack of help from the office staff, leaky roof, frequently shut-off water, and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle. The only redeeming quality was the lovely Gainey neighborhood and close proximity to the Hayden Greenbelt. No thanks, never again, and I don't suggest you rent there either.my best friend treated me to a 2 night stay here, we drove up from vegas. upon check in, there was a mix up in the room we thought we were getting. it wasnt really their fault on this one but they could have done something to try and make us happy. the manager michelle had an attitude of "not my problem, sorry"..but she obviously couldnt care less that we were unhappy upon check in. we were given excuses such as...we are fully booked, but they were not even close. it just went downhill from there. the tv didnt work and although they did offer to come up and fix it that night, we decided to address it in the morning. i said i would call in the morning to ask when i was dressed and ready for someone to come in the room. they showed up unannounced anyway. the air conditioner rattled all night and we both had trouble sleeping. i have a health issue and required an elevator and found the hotel to be very user unfriendly. the only one was at the other end of our floor. at one point my friend was on the patio and i came out to join her, shut the door behind me and it locked shut. we had to wait for a passer by to flag down and have them go to the office to send up help. when the guy came to let us in the first thing he says is what did you guys do?! you probably slammed the door, be careful next time, dont do that. i was shocked that a guest would be made to feel that way. we were asking various staff members where a good place to eat was or what was nearby fun to go do. we got no help here. one guy named lance actually threw up his arms and said dont ask me as he shook his head no saying he didnt know anywhere to suggest to eat. we were in our room and very tired (after not sleeping very well) and probably spent an hour looking for a place to eat nearby on my phone. we were told that we could taken by their hotel shuttle to anywhere in a 5 mile distance. we called well ahead of time to arrange for this service (lance again) so we could enjoy our last night in town. we were so excited to enjoy our last evening and really looked forward to not having to drive somewhere we really didnt know how to get to. upon coming down to the lobby, we were met outside by lance in a big rush saying oh, its going to be 5 min., i have to go fix a lock for a guest. we said that we had reservations and that the restaurant was going to be closing their kitchen in not too long. he said well, a guest is locked out so you have to wait. dont they have a fix it guy for issues like this? you would think. so while we sat outside on the bench the desk clerk comes out and informs us that lance just called and now it will be 15 min. we also didnt receive any type of remorse or apology for any of this by the way. we tried to wait but realized we were running out of time and ultimately had to end up driving to a place we didnt know how to get to and missed our reservations and took our cold food home. in the morning we felt that after all this we just felt we needed some type of compensation. we did get help on this from omar who was the only one who seemed to care that we were unhappy. the things i liked about pima were a pretty pool setting and jaquzzi . at night you can sit by their nice large fire pit in comfy seating. their breakfast was free and really quite nice. make your own omlete or waffle etc..but overall i have to say that the most important thing in a resort is to make your guest feel welcome and at least try to show you care about your guest being happy or not. they did not even come close to being concerned. i could not recommend this hotel for this reason.Last night we had the WORST dining experience ever!  Normally we love the Chart House. We are even Landry club card members.  It took 15 minutes to get even a glass of water, another 20 to get a glass of wine, 40 minutes to receive our COLD entree.  The waitress  was running.  Where was the manager..arguing with other patrons!!!  Why didn't he help out if they were short staffed? Maybe he needs to take a lesson in being on the team!  Don't know if we will ever come back.  Sad, as we have been loyal customers for over 25 years.  People, find somewhere else to dine.So we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery. Of course they knew they were delivering to a resort maybe some plates or napkins at the very least some plastic forks ect. would have been nice. Now let's move on to the food TERRIBLE!!! No sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered. Seen on here biggest egg rolls around, panda has bigger then this crap. Pork fried rice bland. Even my 9 year old says why is there hardly any filling in the egg roll and she never complains about anything. Portions from Chinese food places are for the most part generous well not at this place. And the prices for the quality and portions is a joke. Could continue with more but think you get the picture. Don't waste your money on this place!Grounds are pretty, dated property. Therefore the greeting staff -- valet, bell men, front desk -- needs to be top notch: which they are not. No smiles, no warmth, impatient and unknowledgable when asked asked a basic question the street name parallel to the running/walking path.

Get nice, people! There are many other resort options in the beautiful Valley of the Sun.This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is just pitiful.  The service is OK as befitting a small neighborhood restaurant.  We had egg rolls that were so dripping in oil that it was leaking out as you picked them up.  Bright yellow oily drippings. Not cool.  The kung pow was so-so as was the garlic chicken.  The best part of the meal was the almond cookie!  Even the fortune cookie was sub par. I will not be returning!My friends and I tried going here on a weekend a couple of months ago. After waiting for over an hour, we finally gave up and left. If you don't buy one of their memberships, then you are basically treated as junk. 
They were trying to push the membership on us the moment we walked in and then said since one of us was not a member, we had to wait until lanes opened up. And then as time rolled by, they again were trying to push the membership fee on us...why would any of us invest in a membership when they couldn't even let us try the place out?? 

We have gone to AZ Shooters World since that experience and have not had any wait times and have not had to pay any membership fees.

The employees at the Scottsdale gun club sounded very knowledgeable and helpful if you wanted to purchase a gun, but I would not purchase a membership to use their shooting range OR buy a gun from their establishment based on this experience."No Vegans Allowed", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious.I called to make reservations a week in advance for a birthday party of 15 and while I was told they didn't take reservations, the man I spoke with was very confident that they would be able to accommodate us. He said he would make a note of my party size, have a group of tables set aside, took my name, and we were good to go (or so I thought). I showed up at 6pm just like I was instructed (30 minutes earlier than the party time) and was greeted by a very unhelpful hostess. She said she was not informed of the party and couldn't seat us for 2 hours. TWO HOURS?!? She provided no additional suggestions or options and asked us to take a seat. I'll take my business and tips elsewhere, thanks.I hate walmart.    Very much.Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.Was dissapointed in this last job and wasn't so impressed the first time, so my fault for going back. First, if I am paying $18 to have a simple hem done on pants, I would hope that would include them pressing the pants. Second, when I put the pants on, I am positive they didn't even hem them. I will not be taking them back for them to charge me $18 again, and will probably be doing the hem myself.We had a ton of problems moving in!  Our apartment was NOT ready for move-in.  The office staff seemed very fake and didn't really care.  We stayed there for our 15 month lease with over 17 maintenance calls for our garage door and air conditioner. When our lease was up, they told us they were raising our rent $175 a month!!! Are you kidding me!  After move out, we got a bill for another $200 in cleaning and touch-up paint.  I personally cleaned that place top to bottom to avoid those fees!  
On a better note, we found a HOUSE less than a mile away to rent for less than our Camden rent!  So happy to be out of there!   Do not rent at Camden!Picked up my last pizza Oder today from Streets of NY.  They told me the order would take 25 minutes.  I was there in 20.  What I got was a cold over cooked pizza with very well done wings.  I asked for an extra blue cheese for the wings and was told it would be an extra 50 cents.  Never had to pay before.  Not a good sign when only about four tables with people for dinner at 7pm.  They need to go back to New York to see how it's done.  Too bad, it used to be a good place.Let me start off saying I'm Italian raised in nj, I kno good Italian food. I should have read the reviews first :( Delivery time took about 1 hour 25 min and considering what I ordered was a bit long.. I ordered two cheesesteaks.. They should have it on their menu as grilled or warmed roast beef.. Sorry excuse for a cheese steak. Wings were supposed to be "honey hot" all they were was hot wings with red pepper flakes. And last but not least the hot dog buns with cheese they call garlic bread ew. Don't waste your money order Pizza Hut. Don't kno how place has been in business lolI have been going to this MImi's Café on a regular basis for the last 13 years, but earlier this week, they have completely rearranged the menu, and most of my old favorites are gone.  The food quality has gone down considerably too.  The Cobb Salad used to be great, but the last time I was there, there were just a few bits of hard boiled egg, tomato, bacon, and blue cheese, in what was mostly just a bowl of shredded lettuce.  And they charged me $9 for that.  The manager, who speaks really hard to understand English, did not seem to think anything was wrong with that.  The fans on their Facebook page are in open revolt, and all the Mimi's Café people can say is "change is hard" and that people should try something else on the menu.  They don't get it.  The burden of persuasion is on them, not the customer.  Stay away, at least until they come to their senses.Just wanted to let everyone know, do not waste your money going to MIMIS for breakfast or anything at all.  Been taking a friend my husband and i for years at MIMIS, not knowing their menu changed drastically for breakfast.
1.  the omelets are not true omelets, they have some they call an omelet and it is an open face omelet with egg whites (gross) open face is called a frittata.  
2.  some of the omelets are with a salty ham
3.  there is not meat on the menu
4.  they took away the broccoli omelet
5. there is only 2 omelets one is not an omelet
6. they eliminated and took off items
7. the potatoes are awful and dry nothing mixed with them if you want something with the potatoes, it is extra
8.  THEY CHARGE FOR ORANGE JUICE NOW when it used to come with the breakfast.
9.  the only items good are the french toast
they are trying to mix american with french
10.  their croissants are awful all covered with salt and pepper cannot eat it.  THE BEST PLACE IS THE GOOD EGG, USOver 200$ for a 5gallon bucket of exterior flat paint ?   I DO NOT think so.  Sorry.                   Last three times there my colors were off tint.  Had to return with poor service.  I'll shop Frazee now.    Sorry.  Dunn.Too good to be true. Went in for a car wash.  Had a chip in my windshield. They offered to fix it (by putting in a claim with my insurance FOR me), I said Ok.  Waited super long time. Turned out my car was ready but no one told me so I sat an extra hour.  Then noticed that my "chip fix" cracked and split.  They tried to fill it with resin and not mention it.  it continued to split.  my insurance doesn't cover it.  They said it would be $143.  the guy who replace my windshield had a work order for $215.  I had to pay him. Cobblestone NEVER returned ANY of my phone calls.  to the shop or to Sean's personal cell #.  They are a crock.  AVOID. If I could give "no star" I would.The idiot oil change kid tried to charge me $79.95 for an oil change that I got at Honda for $29.95. Told me myI've amended my review to take out the manager's name since Jason D from Cobblestone so nicely commented that they don't have a manager named Rich.   I should also add that the guy told me he was a manager, I took a picture of him refunding my $20 on my cell phone to capture his nametag, and I have my original receipt and refund receipt from Cobblestone - this location.  I can provide pictures of those as well.  Indicative of the customer no-service ethic at this Cobblestone location.  

****************************************************

I couldn't agree with other reviewers more about the strong arm tactics.  I simply wanted a car wash - that's it.  While I'm still in the car - would you like to sign up for our great value package deal?No I am not going to sign up for your package deal when I haven't ever been there before and I'm certainly not going to now!

As I step out of the car - hey, we can treat your leather seats with a special condition for just $5.  My response?  No thanks, I don't have leather seats.  Obnoxious sales guy says yes, you do - all Mercedes do.  Um, no they don't.  The seats are Leatherette.  He says well, they still need a moisturizer so they don't dry out and crack in the AZ heat.  I again say, no thanks.  Well, would you like to upgrade your car wash today and save $x.  No, I wouldn't and walk towards the lobby.

I wasn't quite fast enough because Sales Guy then says we're going to have to charge you $5 more because there's "excessive mud" on the undercarriage.  At this point, I've had it and say just give me my car, I'm leaving.  Sales Guy says no, no it's fine, we'll waive that fee this time as a courtesy.  Whatever.

The car comes out - dirty, streaky, black substance all over the side panels.  I swear this car had NOT even been in the car wash.  I initially drive away but then get mad about my $20 so go back and ask for a manager.  While I'm waiting for him, one of the wipe down guys comes over and starts trying to clean it.  I tell him to stop.  The manager comes out and says it looks great.  Really?  Why did your guy just come over an try to wipe it down?  What is this black stuff on the sides?  Oh that's just the tire stuff.  I ask why it's on the side panel then instead of the tires.  

Long story somewhat shorter- I point all the issues.  Manager says the car looks great and reminds me that they powerwashed the undercarriage for FREE!  I ask for my money back.  He says no, we can run it through again.  I ask for my money back.  He says, no call the corporate office (on a Sunday).  I ask for my money back much louder.  He says fine, goes to the register and gives me a $20 bill.  

Their sales tactics are disgusting.  The manager was an arrogant, pushy 20-something with absolutely no customer service skills.  I will never, ever get my car non-washed here again.  I immediately drove to Danny's who did a nice job.After reading everyone's review about this car wash, i decided not to use this car was for my company vehicles.  I lease over 100 cars for my executives in Arizona.  I was looking in groupon for car good deals.  I ran into this car was and was initially interested.  But, after reviewing everyone's reviews, we decided this is not the place to do business with.  Thank you everyone.Brought two guests to stay here. Confirmed my rate IN PERSON several days before their arrival. WAS GIVEN ONE RATE, THEN WHEN CHECKED IN, WAS GIVEN ANOTHER!! 
Beware of Richmond, the supervisor. He is nasty and rude. Very poor customer service. Left the hotel, checked into another one. Looks like I am not the only one with a problem with the front desk from the looks of other reviews. 
TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN ELSEWHERE!Have you ever had an apartment or landlord steal packages from you?
Have you ever had an apartment or landlord steal your checking account number?
Have you ever had an apartment or landlord refuse to acknowledge your move-out notice?
Have you ever had an apartment or landlord continue to charge you for rent months after you have moved out?
Have you ever had an apartment of landlord harass you over the phone for rent that you do not owe?

If you answered no to any of these questions Dakota can make sure you experience them all.

I have never experienced worse treatment as a tenant.The receptionist Sonia is uninformed, unhelpful and rude. She is losing them business. I called to make an appt and was so turned off that I will not be using their services, due to her terrible attitude.This is one of the worst time share places  I have ever  stayed at.    It needs better regular maintenance and some updating might help i.e. spend money on bathroom, some new TV's and paint.  If you dont want to hang out there you are in trouble because nothing of note is within walking distance.If you call this authentic Mexican food you are probably not Mexican. I really hate giving bad reviews but this was one of worse restaurants I've been to.  Food is disgusting, more specifically it is bland, greasy and low quality. The place was also pretty dirty. It looked like they hadn't mopped in weeks. I would only recommend this place to my worst enemy.Worst service ever. Stay away. Bartender will sit next to you and play on his phone while ignoring you when hes not completely out of sight. One star for delicious salsa thoughThe food wasn't bad but service was terrible. It took a couple minutes for anyone to come to the front to seat me. Once I was sat it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to come ask me about my drink order(wasn't too busy either).  I ordered a tea and a margarita. The waitress didn't say anything until she reached out to take my menu before ordering. Then when I started to order(because she was taking my menu) she interrupted and said I need to see your ID( in a not so polite manner). I've been here before and the service is a little slow but obviously not bad enough to where I didn't want to come back. This experience has made me not want to come back. I will go to arribas next door when I get the feel for Mexican food.I will never buy tires there again!

Every time I go in there they try to sell me 4 new tires! WTF! I just bought 4 tires at Christmas. Took them in to get rotated and the guy says "we'll take a look at them". I said, "I just want them rotated, they are 5 months old". He comes back and says they are not looking very good. Are you kidding me???

Never again will I go there, nor will I ever refer them. I'm done!Holy crap! I have never felt like a criminal like I did in Kohl's for no reason!!!

I was in there buying alot of stuff for my house, some gifts and a few clothes for me and my girlfriend. We were in there about 2 hrs we were buying a lot of kitchen stuff. 

The whole time the manager was following us and standing there starring with her arms crossed. 

It was soo weird and she looked like Einhorn from ace ventura. 

Any way me and my girlfriend went to the dressing room to try stuff on and the manager followed us in there and then told us we could only bring in 2 at a time. Which isn't even the policy . 

Then after her starring us down we checked out and she went to the register with the cashier and after the cashier would ring things up. The manager would pick it up look in the pockets, shake it, lay it down and feel every where. 

I was like what are you looking for? She ignored me and smiled. I said "ookkay" then the total was 800.00

Then I chose debit and entered my pin. she grabbed the card out of my hand and was like give me your ID

That's when I got really pissed. 

I told her that she isn't allowed to ask for my id when I pay debit. I told her I would love to give her my ID because she will feel like an asshole when she sees it is me. 

I told her to give me her corporate number and I wrote her name down.

She was very silent the whole time and didn't even ask why. She knew she fucked up. She stormed off but not before I told her not to forget she works in Scottsdale and people spending this amount of money shouldn't be treated like criminals. Especially in Scottsdale where it is expected. 

The cashier told me she does that all the time. 

I called corporate and raised hell. 

This was really strange and extremely extremely insulting. Plus all the stuff in Kohl's you can find at Marshals cheaper, and they carry alot of stuff at wal-mart cheaper also.Got there at 10:30am right when they opened, very first customer.
The tables were dirty,
The floors were dirty,
Dead bugs at the soda fountain,
I peeked behind the counter and their were dirty dishes everywhere and stagnant
 water.
At this point who cares what the food taste like.I mailed a package from the Art of Mail and paid extra for second day air. My package did not get to its destination for 6 days! When I went in and asked for my money back the woman was so rude and told me she previously informed me when I sent the package that  there was no guarantee which was not true.  She told me it could possibly be 3 days which I was okay with but not 6.  I will never go back to this place and If anyone wants quality customer service or their package sent by a certain date I do not suggest going here.For years, when my dog was healthy and  seen for yearly check ups and vaccinations, of course everybody was friendly@ Horizon A.H. But, when my dog was severely ill, the doctors proved lacking knowledge and expertise in their own field and I would not have known that if I had not consulted with other vets. Unfortunately, they missed what seems to be a common protocol. I wish horizon animal hospital was all about friendly staff but I prefer to know that  my pet is under the care of a vet who is knowledgable at least when it comes to basics of vet medicine. Very scary experiences after many years of having them as our vet.There were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so I couldn't even eat my lunch.I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.Worst starbucks ever. Just went there at 9:15pm and doors were locked and staff mopping. Apparently 9:30 in Scottsdale starts before everywhere else.Went here twice and both times the service was pretty bad. It took forever to get our orders in and forever to get our food out. I think the place is understaffed or something. However, the servers themselves are really nice though when they stop by and make small chat. I just think there is not enough servers on the floor so everyone ends up waiting for a long time. 

It also amazes me how both times I went, the restaurant was incredibly packed. My roommate guessed that most of the patrons there were people who didn't want to wait for Hiro Sushi down the street. 

As for the food, it was disappointing for what you pay. The quality of my chicken katsu dinner was so bad. The chicken made my mouth sad. I'm pretty sure I'm never going here again.

If you have any other choices for sushi when you are in the N. Scottsdale area, which you do, I would suggest you try there before here.Not loyal to their regulars. Night manager was rude over a coupon when the right thing would have been to accept it that one time but acknowledge the use next time.Horrible pan pizza. Don't waste your time or moneyMy boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE, unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service, friendly atmosphere, and good food.One would think living so close to Mexico that allll the Mexican food would be good. WRONG!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!

 My friend and I ordered 2 Cabo Wabo Margaritas.  The first round was decent but the 2nd round tasted like a nasty $2 house mix.  I brought it to the waiter's attention that there was a large stash of salt at the bottom of my drink.  Which I found odd that there was zero salt on the rim.  He took the drink back and sure enough attempt #2 was yellow, tasted like a mix and once again had a large pile of salt on the bottom with none on the rim.  In speaking again to the waiter he assured me that it would be right the 3rd time and it was a learning lesson for the bartender since they were new.  I stated that it was fine and I really didn't want the drink.  He then brings back the same thing.  My friends drink was just as bad.

The highlight was that when getting our bill all drinks were left on the bill.  My full $10 nasty drink was left, in which was wrong and I didn't want.

I will never return to this restaurant, not that it was my pick in the first place.  It is overpriced for what you get with bad service that does not care about the customer.Horrible service! Waiter refused to place my appetizer while he was taking drink orders. I placed an order for the queso and never received it. I then ordered to fish tacos which were horrible. After about 30 mins after leaving I began to become very sick. I definitely received food poisoning. If you want to have the worst service and food come on in!The service was about as bad as it gets. The food wasn't very good either. I thought that the remodel looked great but the service killed any chance they had for our return.Looks like I'm going along with the crowd on this one. Ate at the Frank Lloyd Wright location yesterday, and that will be the last time they see my smiling face walk through their doors.

The service was awful, and started when the waitress who sat us gave us the "Oh lord, you have a CHILD???" She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before!

The food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying.

The salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely.

When you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!!

I've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper. Soggy...bland....tiny....nothing redeeming whatsoever.

Needless to say, we won't be back to Pizza Peeweecazzo. Ugh.I just got back from from lunch at the Scottsdale location. My girlfriend and I have had questionable service there before, and had previously said that we were not going to again visit the establishment. But today, all I wanted was to have a sunbru, relax and eat. The hostess sat us down, which to me, it seemed like we were inconveniencing her conversation with the bus boy. Then, it seriously took the server 5 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. I had to ask her to bring us glasses of water. I wanted to walk out, but my girl insisted we stay now that we were there. The server was attentive and pleasant, and I began to relax. Then i noticed the hostess, walk behind the bar with her pepsi cup, grab a bottle of whiskey, and continue to pour herself a drink. This seriously fired me up. It seems I have more pride in the brand than she does. I have been a patron of Four Peaks since I moved to AZ 11 years ago. I've had parties at the Tempe location, friends of mine have had baby showers there, and it bums me out to see how drastically things have changed. I support LOCAL as much as possible, but today's episode only serves me to explore my other options..I'll be heading to Chandler to check out SAN TAN Brewery or I will go Nimbus Bistro..bums me out!Go for breakfast or dinner (after 3). Lunches are lacking. I ordered their Chopped Salad (which is a knockoff of the Stetson salad from Cowboy Chiao). I've had it before and it was pretty good. This time, they served it without 2 main ingredients which is pretty apparent if you're familiar with the Stetson's signature "rows" of ingredients. I pointed it out and they said those ingredients were out and offered me a cookie to compensate. If you know the salad is incomplete don't let customers pay $7.99 for it with the hopes they won't notice or be too shy to speak up. With so many great options in the Scottsdale Airpark area, I doubt I'll ever be back. Sad

Oh, by the way, Cowboy Chiao is located on Stetson Drive in Old Town Scottsdale. The Stetson salad is only $10.99 and they actually take pride in it. It's a must try.Here is my saga of the Christmas tree. I had an eye out for Christmas trees since ours finally fell apart last year after years of faithful service. I went to Paddock's after spotting a great sale in October. After what seemed like hours of debating with myself, I bought a 6 1/2 foot tree. Unfortunately, I didn't open it until Thanksgiving when I found that it looked as though it might have been a return. There were no directions, or packaging and the pieces of the tree were not fastened with the ties in the box. Undaunted, we put up the tree and found the entire thing to be poorly made. Could this be the same one I picked out at the store? The branches didn't sit correctly and there were big holes where it was easy to see the middle rod. The tips kept falling off. Frankly, it looked like a Charlie Brown tree - a really expensive Charlie Brown tree.  I bundled it back up and dragged it back to Paddocks. I wanted to get a larger, fuller tree and was willing to spend more money. I was directed to the manager who investigated my purchase. He said that I had bought an "as is" tree and it could not be returned. This thing cost a lot money, even on sale! I swear no one told me it was an "as is" tree! I wouldn't have bought an "as is" tree; I wouldn't have bought a tree that looked so different from the one on display; and I wouldn't have spent a lot of money on an "as is" tree. I dragged the tree back home and looked at it again figuring that I could try to live with it. I couldn't. I went shopping again and found lots of places with expensive, crummy trees. Know where I found a beautiful, reasonably priced tree among a big selection of gorgeous trees?? Sears!! I didn't even know that Sears was still in business!!   However, the service was good, the tree was packaged perfectly, and there were directions and extra bulbs. And best of all, it's gorgeous! DO NOT BUY A TREE at PADDOCK'S!I hate writing a negative review, but I feel people should be aware that their prices are unreasonably high. Either that, or the manager thinks I'm naive. Here's why: I took my jeep in for an estimate to have carpet installed about two years ago. The owner came out, looked over the jeep, and then quoted me $400.  I decided I finally needed to get this done, so I took the jeep in to Unique a couple weeks ago. This time, I was quoted $900 for them to "cut carpet and install." That's more than double, but get this: The manager suggested that I might want to consider one of those pre-cut/pre formed kits available for Jeeps. I knew they existed because I bought a carpet kit before for a couple hundred bucks. I asked how much to install the pre-cut kit. The manager made a call to see how much it would cost just for the kit. He said the kit would be $1,950.00!! That DIDN'T even include installation. For a 14 year old Wrangler?! I was shocked.  So much for their statement "We take pride in offering our customers the service that they deserve at AFFORDABLE prices." I ended up taking my old jeep to another popular upholsterer in Scottsdale and the TOTAL at the other place (a well respected upholster in Old Town Scottsdale) was only $350 for great CUSTOM CUT carpet installed. I believe I was really misquoted by Unique, but I made this point to deaf ears. Always get an estimate from upholstery shops.Terrible service! For the amount of money I paid to play there I would expect better attitude from the staff. The bar girl that came around to serve us drinks was rude and harsh. The golf cart men were quiet and did not say hi. 

I was so disappointed with this golf club that I didn't finish my round. They should be shut down for their service! I highly recommend you go somewhere else to play.I have NO idea how on earth it stays open.  The only thing it has going for it is the location on the Fountain...and that is it.I was working in Fountain Hills today and decided I'd stop in for a cigar on my lunch break. This place was nearby so I decided to check it out. 

The store is small, but nice. The owner has really maximized the space to good effect. For a small humidor he had all of the basics covered and the prices were about what you would expect. 

So why one star? Two reasons. First, I walked in and no one was there--or whoever was manning the store was in the back room. I set off the chime when I walked in, but nada. I decided to look in the humidor, and I took a great deal of time doing so. Still, when I emerged to make my purchase, still no one there. I waited an additional 5-10 minutes, moving back into the chime's motion sensing field a few times to set it off, and finally gave up. Goodbye lunch break. 

Now, to add insult to injury, the whole time I was standing there waiting for someone to show up, there was a TV in the corner blaring out Glenn Beck. Now if you want to be lied to by Beck that's fine. But don't expect to alienate your non-right-wing customers and be successful. Of course, come to think of it, I'm the only non-Republican cigar smoker I know, so maybe he can get away with it. Doesn't mean I have to stand there and listen to it though. 

I'll give them another try the next time I'm in FH. I want local businesses to be successful, even if they are Glenn Beck fans. I'll update at that time.I just played the course last week and it is in the worst shape I have ever seen it in the past seven years. The majority of the sprinkler heads are broken and the course hasn't seen water in a long time. They also, are about to loose 3-4 greens that have just started to turn brown.

I would avoid playing this corse unless you are desperate.Worst service i have ever gotten! They have truly screwed me over. Switching lines all wrong, once I got Verizon to fix it... The attorney sends me a letter saying I owe $400. DO NOT GO THERE!!!... also- the guy helping me named Jose, had no idea what he was doing and had the worst customer service and had no remorse for how much he screwed up my account! They don't even deserve one star.I went to a Spring Training game here on Monday 3/17/14.  The stadium is just off the freeway so I arrived in the area about 75 minutes before the game.  The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.  I waited almost an hour to get to what I thought was the parking lot only to find out it was the parking for the local Marriott.  People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.
Inside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.Bad experience for a first time diner looking for a neighborhood restaurant. There was no steak available for dinner and I was refused service outside, which was such a shame for a perfect arizona night. I wont be coming back againI have been shopping here since moving to Tempe a year ago and have never had any problems until now. I was diagnosed with food poisoning from organic melons grown in Mexico that I had bought at Whole Foods. I called the store manager Steve just now to let him know what had happened. All is said was that the flu had been going around. Amazing that he would not even acknowledge what I was telling him. The biggest disappointment is that he did not even ask how I was doing or zip! I could not believe it, so rude. I will never step foot in that store again. I hope that Steve is not an example of what Whole Foods Corp management is made of. Very sad indeedHave the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.6 years or so ago I would come to this mall every once in a while and I don't remember it being too bad.  Then again I was a college student new to Arizona and I may have just been naive.  The other day I walked in the front door and immediately starting planning how soon I could leave.  The place just has an over-run flea market atmosphere.  I noticed a few generic clearance stores, and with the Virgin Megastore going out of business I'm sure another one will be taking its place soon enough.  I stopped by a couple other "Outlet" stores where the prices were not very Outlet worthy.  

I should have just stayed away and kept the good memories intact.I was looking for a local bakery, since the baker my family usually goes to was busy with personal matters, so I looked on Yelp and found Honeymoon Sweets. High ratings, I knew this spot had to have delicious cakes! I noticed on their menu they sold a specialty cannoli cake and I was sold because my daughter loves cannolis for dessert! I knew she would be ecstatic to get a cannoli cake for her birthday. 

Well I paid $32 for small 6" round cake. My daughter, husband, and myself each tried a piece of cake and all three of us were very unimpressed! The cake was sooooo bland! It was so bland it was disgusting because it tasted like cakey mush!! We threw away the rest of the cake and I emailed the bakery to let them know about my dissatisfaction with the cake. I was informed by email that the owners would be notified, but that was over a week ago, and I have yet to hear from the owners. 

I really expected the cake to have some sort of flavor, especially since this is one of their specialty cakes! I'm also really disappointed that the owners didn't bother to respond to my complaint. Obviously, this one customer (me), is not worth the hassle.

Fair warning to all - do not order the cannoli cake!I have been calling around to various bakeries around the Valley about Wedding Cakes. I have gone in before to buy little cookies and cakes because they are close to my work and they were alright. I think they are a little over priced for what you get. But the reason why I give them one star is that the customer service was HORRIBLE! If I am going to be spending close to $1,000 dollars on a wedding cake for 200 people I not only expect that the food should taste great, but that the customer service is better than that. Just because you have a cake on the front of Arizona Bride does not mean the customer service goes out the window. Needless to say I will be going somewhere else who wants to work with me.So disappointed! Paid about $25 for tasteless Dungeness crab legs. Even the butter was tasteless. Just awful! ... And the karaoke sucked as well. Who has karaoke at 5pm?These guys will do anything to sell you one of their Zagg Invisible Shields for $30. When you protest that they're charging you $30 for a little piece of plastic, they tell you, "Well if anything happens to your phone, you'll get another one free of charge." WRONG. My phone was stolen and I did not get a new Invisible Shield free of charge, but I did buy one online for $4 including shipping. I took it to the Sprint store but they refused to put it on for me. And this after making me wait to talk to a rep. They told me I could return the one that I had bought online and buy one from them and they would put it on. These guys ONLY care about their commission. I'm also sure they get a commission for selling you insurance for $11 a month but if anything happens to your phone, you still have to pay $150 for a new phone, which they tell you "may be a refurbished phone". Save your money. You can buy a refurbished phone on Amazon for $125. The insurance is a total rip off. I am happy with Sprint as a carrier but I would not buy a phone from a Sprint store in the future. I think you can get much better deals at Costco, Best Buy or Amazon.Spent 30 minutes waiting in line on the one car in front of me.. Only to be handed my 2 sandwiches and cold cold fries. Not even slightly warm. I don't usually go to Burger King for obvious reasons but this one was recently remodeled so I thought I'd give'm a shot. Fail. Sandwiches were good.. But how do you get fries wrong? :(  disappointed.The coffee in this place is tasty and I really enjoyed the seating arrangements. The couches were a great place to hang out. 

Sadly, the owner roasts coffee beans on busy weekend mornings..more like Burns the beans. The acrid fumes fill up the coffee shop, making the eyes sting and causing headaches after a few hours of sitting inside. He's also unwilling to consider not-roasting or to offer a fan for the inside air flow.  I had to find a new coffee shop.

The outside seating is present, but totally taken up by smokers. Non smokers won't enjoy their drink outside anywhere.

[edit 9/1]. Wow, I managed to drop my opinion of this place further. Went in today and ordered a soymilk, decafinated drink, and the person making the drink (older guy) gave me this look of "Why would you order this", and rolled his eyes.  It was just rude and really not called for. Some of us don't want to miscarry (caffiene) and can't drink dairy milk.  I also got a scone which was really dry.  Overall, I wish the customer service was better. This place has great couches and live music at night, but the tude and icky food really turn me off here. On the plus side, they stopped roasting beans on Sat morning, so people can actually breathe.  This place could be totally my favorite spot with some adjustments.Xtreme Bean has been a "Home away from home" for me for many years dating back to when there was another coffee shop called Gold Bar Espresso in the same building. I love this building, the employees and the patrons. I have made so many friends here I couldn't ever begin to count them all.

Over the past couple years I've been using the free WiFi as my primary internet connection for my laptop computer. It's a very fast connection these days.

The internet connection has been abused by some patrons downloading torrents containing copy-written media illegally. As a result, the owner has locked down the WiFi and has instituted a content filtering system that blocks access to many commonly used websites. Several of my friends who study here have been disallowed access by this filtering system to critical portions of their online class' website.

While I'm all for blocking access to downloading copy-written materiel illegally gained, especially when it's done in your name, on your internet connection, there has got to be a better solution.

I will continue to come to Xtreme Bean late at night on weekends and to see friends from time to time, but otherwise I will be taking my money, my pallet (the coffee roaster isn't very good), and my laptop to other businesses.I have come here a couple times because I love the layout for working... Good table space, good wifi, and decent coffee.. a good place to meet people to work too. 

But holy crap, who are they hiring? There is one girl here who constantly is cursing at absurd volume levels and doesn't stop complaining about everything. The others don't do anything during the slow parts of the day other than "hang out" and talk loudly about their lives, sometimes complaining about work. (They could use that time to clean up a bit, there are dust bunnies everywhere and pretty close to food/drink.) They also seem to use the coffee shop as a place to play their own music, which is usually really loud metal or rock.  

This place is really dropping on my scale of places to work. Too bad, the good qualities are just being squashed by the people working here.Oh boy!  My husband needed prgressive lenses.  The girl who helped (?) us told me we should get the "premium" progressive as opposed to the standard.  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME!  She figured it all out nd showed my, like a car salesman, on a computer, a price of $171.  With insurance!  When I said that was a lot, she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30!  Good luck with that, sister.   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance. We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance.  Hold on to the wallet here, folks!The owner said I couldn't rinse my water jugs out because he was running out of water? A water store running out of water? Really just lost a long time customer I could of filled up with less water I had 7 jugs never coming back.....As a former dental student, I always take the initiative to visit a dental practice before my first appointment. I was required to place a credit card payment in case I broke my appointment, which is quite understandable as a working class professional myself. Our time is our money. I arrived a half hour early for my appointment and was greeted in the reception area by the hygienist.  After waiting for an hour and a half I was informed that the dentist was still in the operatory and that I was being asked to wait a half hour or longer while she finished working on a patient. Two hours into my appointment and I have yet to have been greeted by the dentist. After informing the hygienist that I couldn't afford to wait around any longer. I still have yet to meet the dentist. I was told to come back and was charged $89 for a comprehensive exam by the hygienist. If you are going to charge someone upfront for failure to attend scheduled appointments, it is essential you hold up your end of the services being rendered as well.i'm not in love with this chain, and this location in particular is pretty bad.
usually dried up or slightly brown lettuce, dirty floors, etc. when you go out specifially for fresh salads, it's just the last thing you want to be surrounded by, i guess.
i lived in an apartment in the same complex as this one for a year and literally went there one time.Another place I'd like to give a negative star review.

For starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games.

We were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda.

Realizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children.

The manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said "All the pizza have been brought out"

Dude, we DIDN'T GET OURS!

Whatever, they were just barely doing what they had to.

I would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there.

For the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures.It's an OK place to go. Last time we went, one of the machines was broken and when we swiped our card (twice), it took the credits but wouldn't let us play. So we asked for a refund on our lost credits. They said they had to have a manger do it. It took 20 minutes for the manager to get to us. He stopped and chatted with people on the way. When he did arrive, he did not even acknowledge us or apologize. He just looked like a big jerk. Plus we had our 2 year old with us and she wanted to play not wait for 20 minutes for something that wasn't even our fault. It can be a fun place but the employees are stupid and don't give a crap.What a bunch of jerks.  If you have a choice you should avoid this company.  I had a test done and I have insurance and I still got a billl.  I called and gave them my info again and they still sent me to collections.  I called again and they said sorry its to late now and they could not do anything.  So I got stuck with the bill for the full amount.  I said why don't I just pay you the discounted rate that you would have had to pay the insurance company.  They said no we don't have to.  So since they screwed up and didn't bill my insurance I had to pay the bill and they were complete jerks when I was trying to take care of it.The only reason this facility deserves one start is for Dr Aaron. He was great and professional. His staff however was not. The nurses wear jeans and t shirts, very unprofessional. We were referred here by other patients, and I see that was b/c Dr Aaron. I don't see how this place could get so many stars. We have only been coming to this facility since March. We saw a nurse practitioner who was generally knowledgeable, but really pushy about vaccinations which made me uncomfortable as I was never sure I really wanted to vaccinate my kids, also I knew there were some vaccines I knew I didn't want to do, however she was very pushy and not understanding.We have had to call with questions and its often the NPs who return the call and they often don't help us or answer anything without telling us to come in. (this is a greedy money issue) the amount billed to the ins company puts more than brad on their plates. We had to take my one yr old to the hospital for dehydration out was nice that Dr Aaron sees his own patients in the hospital, but the first Dr from his practice didn't even come see us or consult with us the night she was admitted...the nurse told us he stopped by with them didn't even come in to say hello it was more than rude and in such a stressful situation he should have made the effort. When she was released we were supposed to follow up in the office however money did not permit got my high copay...they will not see her without a copay collection. Now she has Thrush. She has had this once before as an infant so I an very familiar with this I called in to the office informing them I am not in a financial situation to bring my daughter in however if they had requested the records from her previous Dr they would know she's had it and all she needs is anti biotics. I wanted to take care of this before she was too uncomfortable to eat or drink. Becky refused the antibiotic. They want another office visit and more money. We have an office visit for July which I will be canceling now that I've had so many issues with rude staff and unprofessionalism. If it were just Dr. Aaron we would go there. I don't recommend this office otherwise.This place has gone downhill.  It used to be the best pizza in town, and that is why I kept givingit  chance after chance, thinking they are just having an off night.  But after awhile, you just got to call it what it is.  The food quality has severely declined, as well as the customer service.   After so many mistakes, and disappointing food, I'm sad to say, that I will no longer be ordering from Venezias.  It's just not what it was.There was a hair in my first slice that was long and dark (not my hair). The cheese is like rubber, not cheese-y. I'd rather spend my money at clockwork pizza or big boys pizza; they are comparable in price but exponentially better in quality and tasteAs an undergrad exploring my options for some sort of postgrad/medical school options I walked in and looked around. Looked at some information/ pamphlets and talked to a receptionist. Everything that would warrant a 4 star review, so what could possibly have gone wrong for them to receive such a poor review. 

The spam mail. This place will clog your mailbox/inbox/any other medium of communication they can find just to send you the same information over and over and over again. I realize that you can easily remove yourself from an e-mail list, but the sheer amount of useless crap that they send to you is grounds alone for a 1 star review. Not only is this annoying and a  huge waste of time/paper & ink, but it just reeks of desperation. 

P.S. after reading the above review, (clearly from somebody who works there) in my opinion, $20,000 per year for a "degree" in something most of the world considers a joke is tantamount to education fraud. If you have the estimated $200,000 for 4 years of "education" to throw away be my guest, and if not just avoid giving them ANY of your contact information.I found the customer service to be less than reasonable "standard of care."Never go to these guys. They just want to suck money from us. 

Last friday I went to them as there was a problem with my key and lock. I was facing issues in turning the key to start the car. The guy in the reception, he didn't even check the car or never came near the car, after hearing what i said he gave me a estimate of 400$. I wanted to recheck it and I didn't like his way of judging the problem without even having a look at it, so I went to a local service center, and he took a look at it and told to try the other key which worked. 

So never go to this service center and if at all u go, just do what u wanted to do and dont take their advise or suggestions.I used to donate plasma here and it's not too bad of an experience as long as you get there early but one time I went in and had a puncture wound from a cat on my arm which does happen as I'm a vet tech. They swore up and down I was doing drugs and that I could no longer donate. I told them I had an accident report at work and I could pass a drug test but it didn't matter they swore I was lying. Now a few years later my family is tight on money so I call to see if I could donate and they say I'm on a permanent deferral list but can not tell me why over the phone. I can come in and talk to a medical person if I would like. I asked if it was to explain why or if the deferral could be reversed. Of course it's permanent and I can waste my time just to hear they think I am on drugs. I have seen so many people there that are on drugs still donating even doing drugs in the parking lot but I offer proof and they still say no.I am amazed that anyone liked the food here. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. I mean really, what can you do to spaghetti. Well, I guess you can use old sauce. This stuff was uneatable. The garlic bread was white (that means raw dough). The sauce horrible. Perhaps the sandwiches are better, but i doubt it.Never order a sandwich from a.place with "Pizza" in the name. The beef in my sandwich was good, but the bread was soggy and gross. I ordered fries but got chips. After 20 minutes I'm STILL waiting for fries with no update from my server. It isn't even busy in here. Not too pleased.

(EDIT) - Later on my sandwich was so soggy that the bread ripped in half and all the fillings fell out. Grr. No more Nello's for me~Spent $15 per ticket to see "Catching Fire" in IMAX. Yes, the screen was huge, fine, but the quality of the film was similar to a VHS tape. It was gritty with those spots and squiggly lines that pop up every once in a while. I'm not sure whose fault this is. It could be they simply didn't release it in digital format, but then I shouldn't be charged so much to see it. Not IMAX quality. Not worth $15. They ripped us off. Not going there again if I can help it.The only Starbucks I know that can screw up an Americano every time. I ask for room and they fill to within 1 mm of the lid then suggest that I pour the excess off when I complain. My goal is taste not volume, is that hard to understand?What a mess! I get it...its a coffee shop and not sure why they wouldnt be ready or more organized for morning rush. i walk in and order my drink. i checked and they showed that the Blonde roast was out but they could do a pour over.  no thanks...just dont show it available.  After waiting for second coffee to be made...i was wondering when i would get my regular brewed coffee and pastry.  i had to go back to the register for that becauae the window did not have anything else for me.Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.Ordered a strawberry slush, watermelon slush, cherry slush, and coke slush. Sounds fairly simple, right? Instead, they forgot the watermelon slush and brought out a piña colada slush instead of the coke slush. The girl at the drive-thru was rude when we pointed out the obvious mistake with the piña colada slush and claimed my white colored slush was "definitely" coke. I don't think so. We pulled ahead to wait for the watermelon slush and received a cherry slush. Ugh. When I asked to have my coke slush corrected, the car hop ignored me and hurried away. What kind of customer service is this? Won't be going there again.First time, and last. Food was delivered quickly. Ordered Teriyaki Beef, Lemon Chicken and order of fried wantons. Teriyaki beef was small pieces of beef with good flavor but wierd slimy/greasy texture. Lemon chicken was literally fried scrap chicken (fatty and mixture of light & dark) fried and chopped then covered with bright yellow slime. Slime was lemonish tasting. Total disapointment. Wantons were tiny and way over cooked, meat in the center was as hard as the wanton. Since we ordered combos we got eggrolls too, mine smelled wierd and was pretty greasy. 

Fortune Cookie: Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. (like ordering from here again!)They forgot my drink and they delivered cold food they noticeably stored for a good 7 hours or so. Was not happy.Terrible customer service. I called Walgreen's customer service 4 times, and never received a call from management as promised. Here is the email I sent them, which I have not received a reply to either!

This is the Walgreen's located at 2000 S Mill Ave  Tempe, AZ

"I have called, and spoke with your customer service several times, but have never received a call back as I was promised. The phone number associated with these calls is 480.967.XXXX. The exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls. I am xxxx xxxx, a 59 year old Walgreen's customer of 30 years. I ride a small two wheel electric scooter. It is smaller than a shopping cart. It is not practical to lock this scooter, and the expensive batteries cannot be secured. This scooter is like a two wheeled skateboard with handle bars. I have ridden it to Walgreen's, and brought it in the store with me to pick up prescriptions on many occasions. The last time I picked up a prescription I was told by a man, I assume is a manager, that I can't bring my scooter in the store anymore. This is ridiculous as it is small, makes no noise, makes no mess, takes up very little room, and is my only means of transportation right now. No one has ever complained about it, and when I mentioned not being allowed to bring it in to the pharmacist, he could not understand why, and commented that people bring bikes in the store. I bring this scooter into the grocery, hardware store, fast food stores, and everywhere I go with no problems. I explained this on the phone to your representative, and was told I would be contacted. I was never contacted even after calling back several times, and was told the complaint was being escalated. . This is terrible customer service! I regret that I am contacting my Dr., and having my prescriptions transferred to CVS. CVS has no problem with me bringing my scooter in the store, and  also allow my dog in the store, if I walk there with my dog. I am very disappointed with Walgreen's apparent lack of concern. I will also leave reviews on line wherever possible to let other people know of this incident. "On January 23rd I received an email from Jiffy Lube with two printable coupons attached, one for $14 off of a signature oil change, the other 15% off any additional service done. I saw this as a good opportunity to get some maintenance done so on January 24th I went to my local Jiffy Lube at the address above, a location I've been visiting since around 2003, and got an oil change and two additional services done. Upon checkout I was quoted a price of 65.63, I mentioned a had a coupon for $14 off of the oil change but was told I could not use it. I asked why and was told this particular store ran it's own special discounts and no others could be used because of it. I asked what the special was and was told it was $10 off of the oil change, I said my coupon was worth more than that and I would rather use it, I was told no. I then said okay, and mentioned my 15% off additional services that I would like to use instead, again I was told no because of the mandatory $10 off that the store had no choice but to issue. I asked why Jiffy Lube would email me coupons that I was not allowed to use and was told "I don't know, that's the way it works".

   This is the kind of garbage these oil places get away with every day, and I'm tired of it. For years I've been wanting to review this place with a star or two but ten minute oil changes are so convenient, well I'm done, I'll wait from now on, and my treatment today earned them a complaint with the Better Business Bureau... way to be Jiffy Lube, I hope all of this trouble is worth the four dollars you saved.I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!I hadn't brought anything to Apollo Cleaners for a long time, and now I remember why.   I brought in a wool blanket and the person I gave it to, wasn't sure they could clean it.  She told me they would call and let me know.   Weeks went by, they never called so I stopped by.  They gave it back to me on a hanger and wanted $18.    They may have pressed it, but it was hardly cleaned and THEY NEVER CALLED.

If you need cleaning, find another cleaner.   Poor customer service, questionable processes.Uh, yeah, this place. . .

While my wife was on the search for a good nail place in the Valley to replace the one she used to go to in San Francisco, I took her here a few times.

The first visit seemed okay--nothing bad, and they did a pretty good job.  On the second visit, the attitude seemed to change.  My wife picked a blue color for her toes and some of the techs seemed to be laughing at her.  Maybe we were mistaken, but their attitude seemed really strange.  The job that they did on her seemed okay, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and just assumed that maybe that maybe they were laughing at something else.

It was the third visit that really surprised us.  We walked in early one weekend afternoon and my wife asked for a manicure and pedicure.  The owner told us that he was full up and could not take her at that time.  When we tried to schedule an appointment for later in the day, he simply told us no, and would not schedule one, not even for a future date.  No explanation, no courtesy, just no.

We got the hint.

Now, my wife goes to Colorful Nails in Tempe when she wants to get her nails done.  Always a smile, always great quality, and always happy to get our business.  I'm not sure what the deal is with this nail shop, but we will not "come for nails" there again.A shady place. I went on a Saturday night and the place was empty. The food was horrible. I will not be going again nor do I recommend others to try... The dhaba down the street is much better.Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.i went to this place because of their good reviews here on yelp...
im honestly wondering if i went to the wrong place.
i called 15 minutes before me and my mom headed in
they said they would be able to take us both right away
once we got there we waited 15 minutes before they even started my moms full set
then i had to wait another 10 minutes for them to start my manicure
why does it seem like all nail places do this? if you cant take me right away when i ask, please dont LIE just to get me to come there.
i got white tips and im not too impressed. there are bubbles all through their top coat and the guy couldnt even cut/file my nails evenly
i definitely will NOT be back.
wish i could give ZERO starsI am not sure what happened here in the valley to make this place popular enough to have TV commercials...but, it was not something that is good! 

I am from the east coast, so all you east coast haters go ahead and hate (I am not going back there, I want everyone to have good food...evreywhere). If one of these opened in New York, the syndicates would burn it down as a mercy killing. It would be too poorly executed to exist. 

I am not sure whether that was Marinara sauce, but that's kinda the issue isn't it. The chicken on the Chicken Parmigiana might have been some sort of tender at some point, that's kinda the issue isn't it though. 

Its as if whoever owns this place worked at Denny's or IHOP and figured their cost cutting measures would work just as well for Italian food...

Whatever, I look forward to this place going under. Seems too many 'native' Phoenicians have fond memories of coming here when they were kids with their relatives though. Let it go already. Will you stop eating crap just because of nostalgia?I'm not sure what the fuss is about this place.  The polish I ordered well done was barely warm on the inside and had big chunks of grissel in it.  The "fresh" onion rings were served cold.  I won't be back.Stop charging for refills, Ted's. That worked in 1985, but we all know soda costs you less than a penny.

I like the food a good amount, and it's incredibly petty, but I just hate feeling like Ted's is ripping its customers off when literally every other fast-food/casual restaurant stopped doing this two decades ago.Had a bad experience with promised sale prices on a used car. Drove 30 miles went into dealer to buy the car and found they had jacked it up 1000.00 from what we discussed after they got me in the door. Dealt with Dave, Charles and Steve. Steer clear they will waste your time.Disgusting!  I mean, I get it, it's walmart.  They're gross in general.  But this one takes the cake.  ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS overstock on the floor.  ALL OVER THE STORE!  Horribly run store.  I drive the extra 3 miles to go to a different one.  And this store is walking distance from home.I took my son here to be checked out for a fever and coughing. There was only 1 other person in the waiting room and even after they were called in we still had tow wait for another half hour.  We were called into the room by an awful M.A.  she didn't say hello or say anything to my son and I had to repeat his medicine allergies several times.  She then opens the door and walks out and looks at me like I'm a dog supposed to just follow her.  Then she says in here and just points. I'm an M.A myself and I would have been reprimanded for treating a patient like that. She then left us alone for more than 45 minutes. I had to go out and ask when we were going to be seen. She ushered me back to the room and as she was closing the door said the dr would be in in a minute. It was another 20 minutes before the dr came in and he spent 30 seconds looking at my son, said he had a uri and left.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. They have very poor customer sevice skills and I think some of these people got their certifications off the back of a cereal box.Stay FAR AWAY from this place.  Complete scammers.  My girlfriend brought here car in with a slow starting problem and said she thought it may be the starter.  Without running the simple diagnostic on it to confirm this was the problem, they replaced a perfectly good starter ($550 with labor)--it was only then that they proceeded to tell her that the battery was the real problem.  I asked the manager afterwards why they would not check the starter (which literally takes 5 seconds) and said he just does what the customer asks for and was obviously unwilling to refund any portion of the unnecessary work.  So unless you (or your wife, daughter, etc) are a licensed mechanic, do not use this garage.

COMPLETE AND TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.  You would be better off taking your vehicle literally anywhere else.Definitely NOT Debra.  
She was not as helpful as I thought.  Proofing was poor and though it took 3 times to get one of the cards redone, several complained about the size of the font as the background of the invitation was dark.  Spent a lot of money and should have been very satisfied.  Several vendors were shown the invitation and agreed with me.apparently they do not allow any hats or head gear unless its a cowboy or a baseball cap. Apparently they reason for not allowing a fedora  or a workers cap is it is representative of  "Gang"  paraphernalia. So I assume people who wear fedoras or worker caps are part of some gang however people who wear cowboy hats never congregate or that any "gang" members ever wear these head garbs.

When I asked what is their policy for Sikhs who have to have a turban as required by their religion, they spat saying that there was no such religion and that person would be promptly thrown out for "gang" affiliations.

So much for religious tolerance and sense of good fashion. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat with MS 13 imprinted on it, but then I might be afraid that MS13 members might hunt me down for wearing a cowboys hat with their name on itI play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) 

Why they let me play, I'll never know:)

Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)

It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)

So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)

Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)

When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)

After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)

They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)

The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)

S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.

It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)

S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(

They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.

I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(

The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(

But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.

I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(

I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(

One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)

Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(

Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)

Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).

They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)Well I have to agree with previous reviewers about the rather rude waitresses, but that has never really stopped me from trying out and liking establishments. Food taste and authenticity is more of my "thing". I had tried this place earlier as a coworker swears by this place ( Midwest American). I have really never been impressed or dissuaded enough to yelp about it. In all honesty I think that I should have tried their a-la carte menus which had a bunch of authentic (ask for the cantonese menu) dishes. However I decided to go for the buffet. 

Simply horrible is all that comes to mind. All of the dishes had that "left out for several hours" taste and texture. Both their soups were just horrible. All the items (of which only half of them were replenished) were americanized hurriedly prepared soaking in oil, dishes with chewy meat.The fried rice was rather decent; the only redeeming factor.

 I pity my coworker who eats this waste of comestibles, almost every day.We walked in around 5 (there were three adults and two kids (4 and 2). There wasn't a single other person in the restaurant. The lady came out and didn't even crack a smile, and in fact, was almost bothered that we were there at all. We tried to "kill her with kindness", but she wasn't having it at all. The refused to give my two year old a place setting because "he didn't need it". We were feeling really uncomfortable and almost begging for a reason to leave, but we felt bad. We hoped the food would be better than the service so far. The server went into the back, yelled at someone back there, and then came back out. She came over to take our order about ten minutes later (we were still the only people in the place). I asked if there was any MSG in the food because I am VERY allergic to it. First she said no, and then changed her answer to, "well, maybe a little". I looked at her puzzled (and annoyed that she easily could have sent me to the hospital). I asked if it was in everything and her response was "not everything, well, yes, everything". Again. Are you serious?! Then, seeming annoyed with us, she sat down at a table near by (like standing for two minutes was just too much) and huffed under her breath. Needless to say, I threw two dollars down on the table to cover my diet coke and we left. I've never done a food review before, but I had to post about this. It was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant EVER. And, the fact that she was not going to be honest about the MSG, really irked me too. Please don't even bother going to this restaurant. We moved in down the street last year and have always been curious about it since we shop at the Frys next door. We obviously won't be back!Horrrrrrible gym.  Gross, small, rough towels, they treat their guests like crap, different hours for them, totally inconvenient, people have attitudes, the energy of the place is just yuck, people stare at you, naked, kids screaming in the locker rooms, screaming kids everywhere, the pool or spa was closed 2 out of the 7 times i went.  i had to go back and forth from the locker room to the front desk several times to get a key.  just unorganized, gross, loud, hate the energy, don't like people staring at my butt or kids screaming "IS THERE SOMEONE IN THERE" while i'm trying to change.  there's hair all on the drains in the women's locker rooms.  when i threw a towel down there to clean it up, i just left it on the side.  i woke up the next morning with a dirty towel on my doorstep.  coincidence?  management stalking me?  i have no idea, but definitely didn't like the weird energy there.My son had a $50 gift certificate to John Henry's Restaurant; (supposedly a fine-dining establishment) and on a moment's notice asked his mother (me) to go out for dinner. (I usually YELP restaurants before I go out  to eat somewhere but due to the last minute plans I did not have a chance to do so.) And I am thinking - $50 couldn't go too wrong.
Enter the TWILIGHT Zone.....................

Ok.   so you have  an English sounding restaurant  but with an Italian Menu, Croatian  Greeter/Manager, a decor that is Southwestern with weird French accents; and such inept waiters who are unbelievable.

  Let's start with OUR WAITER.  The manager promptly seats us.
10 minutes later, our server appears- very friendly- but immediately announces he hasn't worked in months since working here years ago and we (unfortunately ) are his very first patrons sinc returing to work here!) .   He proceeds to tell us of his  past misfortunes and  subsequent travels around the world.  Meanwhile, we are thirsty and would like (at least some water) and perhaps order a drink.  When he is finished, I asked  what the house wine was - Response - "Gee, I don't know -it use to be Woodbridge but it may have changed.  He just stood there.  I asked- "can you please find out?"  He said "Oh yea - sure".  We also have  no tableware - nor menu.
Can you spell I-N-E-P-T? 

He came back to take our drink orders and tell us about the drink specials.  I asked if we could see a menu  (mind you we are already  20 minutes into the evening. )  He laughed and attempted to make light of the fact that we had no tableware nor menu.

So while we are waiting - the waiter for the group of 8 women  seated directly behind  us  (from Chicago, based on their very loud conversation) was telling them a story about  God knows what.  He talked very loudly and kept saying  "those Black guys" in his monologue.  There happened to be a couple (black gentleman with his white companion) nearby who could not help but overhear this guy's  very racist dribble and appeared to become very uncomfortable.  The women sat silently and said nothing.  I was about to interrupt him  and tell him that his conversation was rude and to please stop when he ended his rant and left.

The wine list is from HELL- How can a purported fine dining establishment even entertain the thought of having Sutter Home White Zinfandel ($23/bottle)  and Little Penguin Cabernet - ($34/bottle) on the menu?  What a joke - not to mention rip-off
 
About the food.......
The veal dishes we had were ok.  Although the veal (Satimboca and Marsala) were tender, both dishes were very salty.  However, the vegetables were fresh and tender and the potato slices tender.  The bread is hot  but nothing to rave over.  We stuck to one glass of red wine each from the Glass Only wine menu as the bottle menu was lacking and way overpriced. 
 We ended  the meal  splitting  the Tiramisou which was very good and supposedly homemade on the premises.

By the time we left @  8:30 p.m. the place was busy with only 3 empty tables. My son and I could not figure out how this place stays in business considering the poor service and mediocre food/overpriced and  low end wine selection.    Bill for two came to $113 and with our $50 coupon ended up paying  $82 (including tip) .  Way overpriced.  

Trust me -  we will NEVER return to this TWILIGHT ZONE again and if you are wise you won't even begin to venture into it....Based on all the high reviews on Yelp I decided to give this place a try to have my eye brows waxed. The place was extremely outdated, I waited for 20 minutes before anyone helped me, and I just felt very uncomfortable being there. The lady who waxed my brows was pleasant enough but it doesn't make up for my terrible experience. 

When she was done I told her that my right eye brow looked a bit longer then the other and she insisted that the left brow looked longer, so she shortened it more!! She also asked if I ever break out after getting my brows waxed and I told her that I never do. She then put something on my brows to "help with my breaking out" even though I just told her that I never break out from waxing. Without asking she rubbed something onto the skin on and around my brows that smelled strongly of alcohol and started burning. I told her it was burning and her only reaction was "Oh...that's odd." She didn't attempt to wipe off whatever it was that she put on my skin. Once I got home and looked in the mirror I had to correct and shorten the right brow to match the left one that she messed up. Also within a couple hours for the first time EVER, after 15 years of getting my brows waxed, I started breaking out!!! So I had to apply coconut oil, lavender and tea tree essential oils to the areas for a week to heal the skin. 

I will never ever go back to this place and recommend you look else where for waxing. In addition, it isn't very professional to advertise on your website that the Brazilian waxing you offer includes "up the butt". Really? They couldn't have found a more professional and tactful way to say that?This is the most real review on GC here, so read on:

Guitar Center is a festering disease that needs to be stamped out.  It's the wallmart of music stores.

It is employed by world class douche nuggets that think, just cause they work at guitar center, that they have some type of credentials in regards to gear purchasing.  Being a professional musician myself, I try to stay away from GC at all times in order to maintain sanity.  

Reason 1
As a professional musician, I find that GC doesn't carry anything I would purchase other than drum sticks, gig bags, and miscellaneous items.  Never will I buy a drum set, for they do not carry sizes outside of the butt-rock/heavy metal spectrum.   Never will I buy a cymbal from there, for they have none that sound good, and if there is the chance that they may have an ok K zildj, it's monstrously overpriced.  They don't even carry the drum heads I use.

Reason 2
The douchebags.  The last thing I need when I'm coming in to pick up some sticks, or a hardware accessory, is dude telling me what he thinks I should buy.  Usually I try to be nice, but once in a while I have to go off.  Like:
"You should check out the Dennis Chambers Stick", says Guitar Center Douche.
"No thanks, I like those peter erskine ride sticks quite fine", me.
"I'm telling you, if you're doing Jazz, those Dennis Chambers sticks are the way to go.  I always use them when I play Jazz." Guitar Center Douche.
"Oh really, when's that, at your house at night, cause I've never seen you out at any of the clubs playing." Me.
"yeah, well I mostly play metal." Guitar Center Douche.
"Yeah, will I mostly play jazz, as my job, so don't try to upsell me on sticks." Me.

This reasons is echoed throughout every musician I hang with.  The most recent horror story was about my friend try to buy a PRS guitar from them that they accidentally sold while it was on hold for him.  The floor clerk had this to say: "Sorry about that dude, how about I go grab a strat of the wall for you."  If you play guitar, then you know someone shopping for a PRS probably doesn't need another strat, and you'd think a professional guitar salesman would know too. 

Reason 3
They treat their product like shit.  I don't know how many times I've heard of people getting drum sets, and the dude wheeling out a damaged box, saying the drums are fine, only to find the shells being damaged when they got them home.  Also, I've seen one of my buddies go through 4 different premier kits, because the shells were out of round.  The GC dude says it must be the boat ride, we called Premier, and they said they ship all their kits via airplane.  If you buy a guitar there, take it into a luthier immediately, because GC doesn't tech any of their gear, they just put strings on and hang it on the wall.

Reason 4
Guitar wanking in the store...  There's nothing that makes me want to beat my head into a wall more than 3 to 6 dudes demoing guitars playing Metallica licks really badly.  This also goes for really loud crappy drum solo guy and couldn't play a melody on keyboard piano dude.

Reason 5
Their Pro Audio section is the least pro I've seen.  It's like mid grade.  Poor mic selection too.

Reason 6
Their online service has much better selection, way better prices, and a better atmosphere.

I understand that all the good ratings are coming from people that don't have such a critical sense of musical gear, but this is understandable for weekend warriors and hobbyists.  As a professional musician, I stand behind local shops like Milanos, where one can get some personal service from a dude that really knows his shit about drums, and pay into the community rather than this megalithic Douche Center.The one stop for everything is convenient but a potential source of "over ordering of  exams/labs/tests/etc."  As a former patient of 8+ years, the multiple tests, every 3 month potential "wellness visits" became a financial drain when insurance wouldn't pay because the service was deemed " not necessary".  It seems that the multiplicity of tests/labs/etc. on a frequent basis only benefits the owner - Doctor Turner?  Be careful when you sign an ABN - Advance Benefit Notification - your insurance probably won't pay and you will!!!!!   We got thrown out of the practice because we challenged and wouldn't pay for two procedures determined by Medicare and Tricare to be unneccesary - slightly over $400 worth - real professional way for Warner Family Practice to treat long term patients in their 70's!I think an unborn fetus is smarter than the people who work here.

Stay far away if you don't want to get the crappiest Taco Bell you have ever had.

Blah.What a horrible customer service organization, after waiting for 5 hours they call and tell me they aren't coming and ask me to take another day off work and wait for another 5 hour window.

I'd rather wash dishes by hand, I'd avoid them at all cost.TOTAL RIP OFF... I've had my Kenmore washer now repaired twice due to the same problem -- which tells me not to buy Kenmore anymore but that's another story.  The part in question is a "lid switch", and based on feedback in the web, other people have had the same problem with this part breaking.  So it first broke in 2003 -- and my total repair bill (with parts) was $103 and some change.  Then it broke again in 2012, and the repair bill jumped to $200 and some change.  Okay, I know there is such a thing as inflation, but for prices to nearly double in nine years is a joke.  The part in question was about $16 in 2003 (supplied by Sears) but in 2012, they charge me about $58 for the same part -- it tripled?.  So I Google for the part (or a compatible part), and low and behold I find it for under $10 in year 2012!!!  It is even sold for about that price on Sear.com's web site.  Unbelievable.  So I called Sear to complain, and they said they'd have someone call me back.  They never returned the call.  I'm done with Sears because they violated my trust with them.The food is okay, nothing special. I think it's overrated. Nothing special. I think there are more better burgers and fish and chips out there. I think it's only good for survival food. One star is because they have good service and that's about it and nothing more.Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a "wellness plan". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a hospital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.Normally I have to give BWW a good review, but today was another story.  I met a group of friends to watch the Cardinals play and to have lunch and libations.  I meet here regularly with a group of 6-10 friends and we usually experience good service.  Today, as usual, we had good service, but ther was a twist.  I THOUGT we were leaving and my ride wanted to run an errand, so I stayed behind with a couple of friends while the errand was completed.  Over the period of 1 1/2 hours, I ordered 3 beers.  When I requested my (2nd) check, I was charged for 5.  I informed the server of the discrepancy and was told that "the video would be reviewed and my ordeer would be revised, if necessary".  I was later advised that management didn't have time to review the video and that 2 beers had been "comped" and that from now on, I would have to "pay as I go".  Well, that's all fine and good...except that I only ordered 3 beers and I wasn't "comped" anything.  I asked to speak to the manager.  He showed up, was polite and cordial, but insisted that because I was the only one ordering Michelob Ultra (in the entire establishment), that I had ordered 5 and was being comped...further, he stated that "we can't be comping beers for everyone, so you'll have to pay as you go from now on".  

I've been a BWW customer since 2009...this is the FIRST time this sort of thing has come up, so I'm hardly a scammer.  I would think they would take my record into account when making such judgements into account, but evidently not.

Our group participates in happy hours and sporting events on a regular basis and we enjoy an atmosphere where good service and value are are a must.  Moving forward, I will not be patronizing BWW for these activities.PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO VISIT.

We first started going to warner vista after we adopted our dog a year ago. The service was ok, never great, but never bad. So we kept returning. On a saturday morning I called in to get my dog seen as he was showing some alarming signs he was very sick. Warner Vista was not able to accommodate the request and suggested i go to an emergency animal hospital or wait til Monday. I then called Caring Hearts Animal Clinic, from a friends recommendation, and they made space for him that day. He tested positive for Parvo even though he had been vaccinated at Warner Vista. Caring Hearts treated him that day outpatient as inpatient was very expensive. Caring Hearts also suggested that i get in contact with Warner Vista so they could call the vaccine manufacturer as the Manufacturers have guarantees and will cover the costs if our dog meets the criteria. Warner Vista was closed til Monday. Sunday Caring Hearts opened 730 am for our dog's outpatient treatment even though they were closed. They opened before opening hrs on Monday for the same thing. At 8am monday i called Warner Vista explaining my dog has parvo, he was vaccinated there and i need them to call the manufacturer to see if they would cover the expenses. The lady said Denise is out of the office and she does that. I inquired if there is anyone else at the office that could call and inquire and she said no. Tuesday morning Caring Hearts opened before hours again! for outpatient treatment. 8am tuesday i call in again to Warner Vista to make sure Denise contacts the manufacturer. The lady said Denise doesn't come in til 2pm and she will call me right away. I did not hear from Warner Vista again til a week later. I called Caring Hearts right after this on the tuesday and they were in shock. They went ahead and got in contact with the manufacturer, even though they have no relationship with them and use a different brand vaccine, and within 2 hrs they and agreed to cover the expenses. Tuesday at lunch i took my dogs in for inpatient treatment at caring hearts. By the next Monday at 4 pm (7 days later)! i got a call from Denise at Warner Vista asking for information to contact Merial the vaccine manufacturer. I hung up in shock. We had said goodbye to our dog the night before because it did not look like he would make it. Fortunately, he did, he didn't eat or drink for 12 whole days and by wednesday, after 13 days of being sick, 12 days of treatment (9 inpatient) he came home. I know that without that inpatient treatment he would be dead, and we would not have been able to provide that, not knowing the costs would be covered. 

My dog would have been dead if i had waited for Warner Vista, Caring Hearts Animal Clinic not only saved my dog, they took the initiative when Warner Vista failed miserably, and also told us that when and if we reach the $5000 limit the vaccine manufacturer will cover, they (Caring Hearts) will cover any costs after the $5000. 

I really hope you read this and do not take your dog to Warner Vista. And to top this review off, our friends dog that was vaccinated at Warner Vista also got parvo. Just something to think about.When something goes wrong, they don't stand behind the food they sell.I got to admit this location is pretty fucking gross. My boyfriend and I got milk shakes and they tasted like complete shit. It tastes like spoiled milk or just that the lazy fucks that work there don't clean the machine. Burger King your going down hill!!!OK, this will be a long one as I am furious over Big O!  I just left there 15 minutes ago so this is still fresh in my mind.  Last week I made an appointment in person to schedule a front end alignment and to have some straightening cams (bolts) put in to correct some issues.  Today (Sunday August 11, 2013) I went in at 10:05am per my appointment time.  The assistant manager German stated that it would be about an hour to get it done and quoted me the price.  My first problem (minor) was the supply fee of $16 for rags and cleaning stuff... what?  I am paying separately for their stores supplies, are you kidding me!  As a business owner purchasing supplies is part of your business costs and I would never pass that on to my clients let alone say "Hey, I am charging you for my supplies!"
After a 100 minute wait (just over an hour and a half) I got up and noticed that my car was parked outside and questioned why I was not called up to pay as I had other things to do in my day.  German stated that my ticket was hanging and was next.  In other words my car has not been touched the whole time I was there.  I asked what was the point of an appointment if I am treated like a walk-in!  He did not have an answer for me and I am perplexed why I was not informed of the delay after being told it would be about an hour.  I just sat there thinking my car was being worked on.  What puzzles me is that I saw my car on the hydraulic lift a few minutes after getting there and then was told by German that there was a truck in front of me.  Again, what was the point of making an appointment?
Needless to say I was furious that MY time was not valuable to them as I had other places to go that day.  Offering me a ride home was not the solution.  This is the typical Corporate mentality that I can not stand!  There was no consideration for my time and the nickel and dime on supplies was an insult to my wallet!  I can see now why most of the Big O tire reviews are two stars or below.  Should have went to Yelp before I went to Big O tires.
In addition when I asked the manager for his card he said that he did not have any (very strange).  When I asked him to write his name on the Big O tire envelope he said he would not because he was with a customer nor would he tell me his name.  As a manager he should be re-trained on how to handle disgruntled customers as NOT giving your name is not a best practice!  I will never go to or recommended Big O tires.  Discount Tire has the better reviews and that will be my next stop when I need tires.  As far as front end alignments I will support local community shops with good Yelp reviews.
I will also send a copy of this to the BBB who will send a copy of that complaint to Big O tire corporate office.  I don't waste my time with corporate phone transfers to other departments.  I doubt very much that dealing with corporate directly would make any difference hence this Yelp review and the BBB.  If you are a potential customer reading this review I would steer clear of Big O and find a better shop to service you.
As a business owner myself I would never treat my client like this.  It is because of this that I have a 4.75 star rating on Yelp with 32 reviews!Terrible experience! Went in for a simple fill, 
and came out looking like I had press on nails
from the drug store; tech could not speak 
English and his overgrown nails were dirty.
Not a sanitary place; will never go back.
Don't waste your money!Horrible wait. Horrible service. First and last time will ever patronize.Terrible service.  I brought in a suit jacket and pair of pants.  The pants came back more wrinkled than when I brought them in and they ruined my suit jacket.  It looks like they put the suit jacket in the washer and dryer and now it has permanent little wrinkles all over.  Employees didn't try to fix it and said it would have to wait for the owner and they didn't know when he would show up.  After a day of waiting I took everything to a new cleaner to salvage.

I would rather pay a little more to make sure my clothes come back in one piece.  Not worth it.Finally shampooed the dog myself. FYI Casper's, she does not have any naturally yellow fur- it's as white a new fallen snow and very shiny now. I have told everyone how you lied to me about shampooing my dog,and I will continue to let people know about your dishonest practice.Glendale Community College is not worth it how they run their office is a joke. They do not know how to communicate and every time I call in or go in with a question they have no ideal what the answer is and promise to call back with the answer but they never do. On top of that after months of preparation to pay for school out of our pocket, moving and adjusting work they dropped my spouse out of her class the day before it stared without any notification! all because they messed up on their paperwork and they said there was nothing they could do about it...really? Did I mention also it took over a month to get registered because the person in the office marked her down as an illegal alien.. 
GCC has dropped the ball and because of there communication and unprofessional-ism and lack of training the students suffer.  So don't waste your time or money.??? Closed  :(Laughably, appallingly bad for the price point. You can do much better for $8 than bland noodles, boring fried rice, and awful egg rolls that left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm shocked it took 30 minutes to prepare the sweet and sour pork I carried out of the restaurant.Now that I have a little more experience in jewelry making and bead shopping, I can say that A 2 Z isn't all that. Every time I go, they don't have what I'm looking for. 

Not only that, they watch me, as if I'm trying to steal something.Very incompetent. Would not recommend to any friend or family member.This place was not clean, unorganized and unprofessional. The surgeon didn't even wash his hands before looking in my mouth and he still had ink in his hands which means he didn't wash them before coming I to the room! He even was looking at the wrong X-ray for my mouth because I didn't even get X-rays in that office. The staff was unprofessional and did not have good communication with each other. I went there because my previous surgeon was not covered by my insurance for the procedure I needed otherwise I would have stayed with him!!! I WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone unless they are absolutely desperate.I've been here about a dozen times and it used to be decent, but this ultra mega bitch bartender has ruined it for me.Last 3 times I've been there she always leaves the bar to go out and smoke and talks with all the regulars. I get it..it's a local dive bar and you chat with the regulars, but you disrespect anyone new. We asked for another beer and she sighed bc apparently she wanted to go home. Other night someone threw up in the bathroom so she flipped and kicked everyone out of the bar. My friend and her got in a fight bc she was telling him he needed to finish his beer. Cash only? Yup. Place sucks, don't go.Probably one of the worst bars I've ever been to.this place is dirty and the food sucksOk I can only say this: WTF?  No wonder this chain is having financial problems.  I went in to find items that were in the Sunday sales circular and this location had NONE of them. Again WTF?  Nor did they have any staff that cared about helping anyone find anything.  I was in that store looking for things for about 30 minutes and the only person who spoke to me was the panhandler outside the store.  The paid staff was too busy somewhere else 'cause they sure weren't visible in the store.Waited until noon today to take my sick child only to find out that they do not accept Aetna and the charge would be 270.00 for visit and then extra for any tests. They no longer accept Aetna (and a couple other big names) This is one of the only places in Phoenix that you can take you kid to that is pediatric urgent care (other then going to the hospital)  Disappointed that they care more about money instead of healing sick babies.Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.The manager here (possibly owner) is a complete asshole. The bread wasn't cooked and was gooey all wet and he refused to re-make the sandwiches. He's a real cheap bastard. The workers seemed to be in good spirits; I have no idea why seeing who they work for. I wouldn't return to this location if you paid me!It has finally been put out of its misery.  
Ralph's is closed.
There's an urgent care there now.Way to Fast!     Burger was under a warmer(heat lamps)yuck!   No way to cook burger in 2mins.      I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger and at first order taker repeated back saying that it was a plain burger with bacon and cheese and I politely corrected.   Bacon Cheese Burger with everything.   I got home and to my surprise hardly anything on burger 2 skinny tomatoes and less than an ounce of brown lettuce...had to open fridge and put lettuce and mayo on and I had ordered that.   I also chose to add ketchup and mustard due to dry burger...again YUCK!     This makes me wonder how my wifes breakfast sandwich was...probably nuked it!   Frys horrible!  Cherry Limeaid only good thing!     Learn how to build a burger...very slopply!  How does this place have 5 Stars?I went in for an oil change thinking this would be quick and easy.  Uhm... not so much.  It took her a much longer to check me in than I expected ~ 5-10 minutes ~ and then my van sat there for more than 20 minutes with what seemed to be a small team of technicians floating around.  Worst of all, I wandered away for a few minutes (ya, easy access to the evil store within) and when I come back I see the van pulling away.  HUH!?!?!?!!!!   I asked where the van was going and she said "not far".  Um... I DON'T THINK SO!    I went out side to see where it went and it was parked outside.  WTF?   I go back in, she hollers at tech person sitting in the office and he comes out and says "we had to decline it".  He said there's a dent in the oil pan and its right by the plug.  They cannot service it.  Well OK.  I cannot give you guys a good review.  You WASTED 45 minutes that I didn't have.  The oil pan is not their fault, just the lame, lazy attitude and overall waste of time is.  First and last time I go here.

Note that their basic oil change is $30.  I the same service plus a carwash AT THE DEALERSHIP for less than $30.  It's not as convenient, but its where I'm going from now on.i haven't been here in ages, but i'm sure much hasn't changed.  whoever said that they are over-priced must be from somewhere else because there prices are definitely low to average.  which is why there hasn't been a single incident when i haven't witnessed a bunch of over-served d-bags.  it takes a LOT for a bar to make me feel uncomfortable, but this one succeeded.  there are some great people that hang out there, but there are enough shady ones that it's just not worth it.  there are too many other dive bars in the area to ever go back here.Don't buy anything from here! Their cigars are dry. The " walk-in humidor" is sub par! I purchased a $35 dollar blazer torch lighter. After filling it with butane I discovered it had no spark, broken! I tried to return it six days latter with a receipt. The owners son became argumentative, loud, and rude. He said  they wouldn't return or replace it. No, and I mean NO customer service ! I wish I had read other reviews before buying anything from there. Seams like others had the same complaint. I'll be contacting the BBB and filling a complaint. Save your time and money, go to a real tobacco shop. 

Update: it's now closed.I use to be a member for years, though canceled my membership about 2 years ago. About a month ago I went in to get a new membership using my employers discount. The man that I was working with was difficult. He wanted to charge me more then what was discounted through my work. I even had the print out from work that I was to have brought in to prove I would get a membership at that rate. I was so frustrated. The man picked up on my frustration and started to down talk me saying I didn't print the right print out. I ended up walking out when he was talking because at that point he wouldn't shut up and listen. When I was about to the door he started making fun of the situation with the guy sitting next to him. 

Never again will I be a member. I now go to 24 hr fitness on 43rd ave and bell.Can't stand this place. The workout area smells terrible. I was told that my gym bag is too large and I am not allowed to bring it with me when I workout. My gym bag has equipment contained in it (belt, knee sleeves, lifting shoes, etc) and is always kept out of the way of others. At the same time, people are allowed huge racquetball bags lined up outside the racquetball courts. There are also weights left on the bar or not put away and I routinely find dumbbells where they don't belong and someone could easily trip over.I opened an account with Arizona Federal just to keep my savings in there. I went in on the day after they had updated their computers. So naturally everything was glitchy and taking longer which I totally get and understand. Anyways I put a substantial amount of money in my savings. I had the account for about 4 months and need to take out $100 dollars. It was 6pm on a Friday so I went threw the ATM. It says account 0.00 savings 0.00! I was so freaked out I mean this is my largest savings account! I called the number on the back of my card and NO one would help. Everyone's response was its after hours we can access your account on Monday. Are you kidding me?! I won't be able to sleep till Monday! So since it is after "business hours" you can't let me know if my money was stolen or what the heck is going on? I literally got transferred to 10 different people. Finally I didn't let this lady get off the phone till she helped me. It turned out the lady who set up my account put me under a "special savings" so it's not something you can access threw an ATM. Why couldn't anyone help me with this information? And they were so rude! Anyways I'm going to take all my money out because that is just ridiculous what if it was stolen!These guys are crooks and deceiving liars. Do not go here! I went in today to get a quote of brakes, they broke my window and claimed it just fell after shutting my door, then they added about ten other things to the quote, one of the things being my rear shocks leaking, and have the quote telling me it would be for the original same shocks that on our the truck, these guys do not even know their vehicles. He quoted me for the bottom of the line shock, knowing my truck comes standard with bilstein shocks. They would not listen to me when I said "no" put my vehicle back together and I am leaving. Continued on and on with ridiculous prices. Do not go here!  They are scum of the scum.  You can know that I will never come back.They over charged me and refused to give me a refund saying I can have their advertised special next time.They are very nice and good at selling pools. They were recommended by a friend who is now sorry too.They built my pool about 6 yrs ago. Wow! did it look nice. However quickly fell apart. Started with the decorative stone (sand stone?) it just crumbles into the pool. Obviously not meant to get wet. 1/4 inch Gap appeared between the tile and deck all the way around. The bottom has two cracks in it. Yet I continued to brag about this great company that built my pool. I was in denial. I did not want to admit I purchased crap. There is a leak in the plumbing somewhere under the pool rendering it now useless. It might not be so bad if their warranty outlasted the half-assed workmanship. Sure Lisa and Cohl are nice, but they are not the ones building your pool. It is built by losers that have no skill or pride in their work. To be fare they did offer to try and see if we "could maybe work something out" after I complained. At this point I am too disappointed and disgusted to even allow them to build me a dog house. Customer service is everything they say. When spending 30 thousand dollars I would rather have quality.If I could, I would give this place a zero because that's what I got from this place; nothing. Here's why.

I don't plan what I'm going to eat so when Japanese come into my mind, I think about the few places in town I can go to.

Recently, my party came inside some time after lunch on a workday and we were told the place is closing and schedule to be re-open later. I was like What? , on a work  hour?

On another prior visit last year, I step in and ordered 2 dishes to-go on a worknight but later another waiter girl came back to me saying "because we are so full of (other) customers, we won't take to-go order". That was the whole point of my to-go order because there lines waiting outside. Totally illogical, they could have said it would be a 30 minute wait and I would be fine with that. They didn't even try at recourse or more politically correct; they were not properly trained.  I think they've added outdoor seats to mitigate this.

I felt priveledge to have patron them a few times, and my review of  the food is typical Japanese; clean and fresh. But, You can get that down the street  on Bell Rd too.


Never have I felt similar to being discriminated and these waiters are northern Asian!  At least if  I got something from them even bad food, it was a purchase the merchant supposively should be happy to pocket and there's a chance I come back.I will never darken their doorstep again. I've had sub-par sushi before, but I have never, EVER left an establishment feeling ill after eating there. Couple that with their lazy service, lackluster flavor combinations (what is that gross sauce that they put on EVERYTHING??), and borderline microscopic portion sizes, it was absolutely NOT worth how much I paid. Never again. Ew.Terrible grooming experience both times, I'm never coming back. My little yorkie's dew claws weren't trimmed, her head is buzzed while the rest of her body remained long. But most importantly (to me at least) was that the staff wasn't compassionate towards her at all which made me nervous to leave her with the grumpy groomer. My little girl is my world and I know she's apprehensive so a little cooing and not cringing at her kisses would make a huge difference when I hand her over. I'm so angry I wasted money here.Ripoff alert! Went through the drive-through, and ordered the Thursday taco special for $2.09. Paid with a five, received 56¢ back, and no receipt. Hmmmm. Not only a ripoff, but the food sucks too!I agree with Margaret's view below. There is a lot of attitude at this place. Until recently, they used to charge you for refills on drinks.  There is a lot of attitude here from the waitstaff.  They hire a bunch of kids who don't know there menu and really don't care about their food....or you for that matter.  

The pizza has no taste. The cheese clumps instead of melts. The toppings like the pepperoni tastes as if came of a DiGiorno frozen pizza and their other Italian dishes taste as if someone bought some Hunts Ketchup and poured it over pasta. 

Oh yeah and did I mention the attitude?  The only reason this place is still in business is because its become a happy hour hangout among the students in the area and the blue collar workers who to get their fill of their dollar Budweisers.  I feel bad for anyone who actually takes this place seriously and drives here to have dinner. 

Their wings are good and their happy hour is amazing otherwise, I'm giving this place one starThe cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,
horrible cheese.I had a bad experience here, so I don't think I will be returning to a Caramba restaurant again.

When I went my food was alright. It wasn't very good, but I didn't think it was too bad either. What really turned me off was that one of my friends that went along with me found a bee in her meal. When she took it to the worker he told her it wasn't a bee, but an olive. He finally gave her a new one after trying to unsuccessfully convince her that it was an olive. It was definitely an insect. It bugged me that he didn't even take responsibility for it. After that I didn't really finish my meal, because all I could think about was the bee in my friend's dinner.-Conveniently located next to Trader Joe's.

-Purchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.

-Clean store.

-Service...not so great. :( 

-Each time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and 4-5+ customers in line (like Hobby Lobby).

-Most prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.

-Observed two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer check-out.

-After deciding NOT to wait in the long one-cashier line, I left my "potential purchases" near the register. Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.

-I'm surprised that this business is still open. You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible.I really dislike this location! This was the second time I came here and the second time I hated it. The one on 16st is so much better! 

Anyway, we came here early in the day when it wasnt too busy so the service was good. The bread wasnt very good or fresh. I got my usual which is the fresh tomato mozzerella which is amazing at the other location. And my bf got the creamy asparagus or something like that and they came out immediately. Now, I like fast service but too fast service means the food is old. Anyway, everything was all well and then the aftermath was awful. I ended with a headache and stomachache, overall really sick. 

Do yourself a favor and go to a different location, this location has the worst rating out of the rest, so that should tell you something.I heard about Mistique when I bought a living social deal a few months ago. I paid $29 for a hot stone pedicure and hand massage valued at $60. I was very excited to try a new place, and assumed it was something special considering I never pay $60 for a pedicure!
My first impression of the boutique was that it was small, modern and I really enjoyed the overall vibe- but where are the pedicure spa chairs?? There was one small chair, and the woman came out from the back carrying a large ceramic bowl filled with hot water. I don't know about anyone else, but I really like the massage chairs and the jets that are standard at most nail salons. It was a disappointment not having that.
The woman who did my pedicure was funny and very friendly, but I don't think she does a lot of pedicures. The paint looked sloppy and since I hadn't worn my own sandals, I left barefoot.

Cute decor and friendly tech doesn't mean I want to go back for a VERY overpriced, crappy looking pedicure.Worst Trader Joe's ever! Never coming back here! Granted, I live in the East Valley, and only stopped by because I was in the neighborhood.

First, the place is filled with the olds, probably due to it's close proximity to Sun City. Thus, imagine the typically cramped isles of TJ combined with self-absorbed old couples standing in the middle of each isle, arguing with each other about what food to buy! Normally, I have no truck with the elderly, however, these must be the folks who voted for their fellow olds, Jan Brewer, complaining how immigants are ruining AZ. How about we talk about how the snowbirds are making our shopping so much more difficult?

Secondly, I ended up with the most surely cashier I've ever had at a TJ. Before ringing up my one 6pack, she eyed my suspiciously. "Just how old are you?"

I understand that clerks are supposed to ID people, and I always have my ID ready to show. However, her suspicion floored me, as I surprisingly  stammered "I'm 40!!!" while showing her my papers. (BTW, I'm not white!) She studied it for a good 15 seconds and then continued to ring up my stuff, without the requisite pseudocompliment.  "Oh, you just look soooo young for your age" joke. C'mon, what underaged teen is going to try to pass off as a 40 year old?

Upon further reflection, maybe the clerk was none other than crazy loon Jan Brewer? After all, all racist old white women look the same to me!

(One star, because the friendly clerk who gave me the sausage/mustard sample was nice, and agreed that the mustard was "surprisingly good!"What a let down! After reading the great reviews I was excited to try this place out - I found the food, service, and atmosphere to be below average. Stood at the hostess stand for 5 minutes with no greeting, almost walked out, bad first impression. My spicy tuna roll was decent but the crab roll was 1/2 mayo and 1/2 crab. The waitress was sweet but never checked up on us after she delivered our food. When we were done she came over and looked down at my uneaten roll, I made a comment about it tasting like pure mayo and she just said 'sorry', no offer to replace it or take it off my bill. The fish did not taste fresh, uncaring service, and it took almost 2 hours from start to finish for a few rolls and apps, won't be returning.This is my second review of Arriba Mexican Grill in Glendale and I'm sorry to say, this will be my last because I am not going to return to this place again.  

Again, the stacked beef enchilada's were void of any flavor at all!  Although the food presented well, I mean, it looked good but my goodness, it was just terrible.  The bland meat was simply browned in a skillet without any flavoring at all and then shoved on to a corn tortilla and then covered with what was supposed to be red chili sauce.   There was supposed to be some of those world famous Hatch green chilies mixed in with the meat as well but again - zip, nothing.

When our waiter finally came by I asked for some chili on the side and a beer thinking I could salvage this mess but after a long long wait, still no chili and no beer.  Finally, my wife caught his eye and a few minutes later I had my request on the table but it was no use, this meal was dead. 

What a disappointment.  I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food, I just haven't seen it in a long time.  

What a disappointment.  I was anxious to leave this bad experience behind but it wasn't that easy.  No check.  Again, poor service - then at last, after about 15 minutes our AWOL waiter finally shows up with our check and we are at last able to leave our 1/2 eaten meals behind.WARNING! PLEASE READ!

I was so astonished by how bad the service was here, not to mention the RISK that I made a yelp account just to warn others. Coming from a native New Mexican, I will echo what so many people here giving the one star reviews have said (and if you read on you'll see why), the service... 

I came here for mine and my girlfriend's one year anniversary. It was suppose to be a special day. We are both originally from New Mexico so the idea of being able to order the food we grew up on sounded great. We were very excited to go here, but that was very short lived... As I walked up there were two girls and one very young boy at the front counter. I saw they had a very nice patio and asked if we could sit out there. They said that it might be a problem, that a party would be coming and when they got there we would be asked to "leave." I found her choice of words very odd and the other girl tried to explain we would have to relocate. I looked at my girlfriend, already with a bad feeling about the place and asked if she wanted to stay, which she did. 

Now this is when things get important, remember this: I said "I guess we'll eat inside." and the girl replied "Okay, I'll seat you in the bar then." I looked at her crooked and said "Um, no...? Is there a table in the dining room? We don't drink or smoke..." I looked around and the dining room had plenty of tables, not even half full. The girl sighed and grabbed some menus with haste, then took us to the very back, in a gloomy little corner and tossed them down on the table. I was amazed and almost walked out but my girlfriend was still excited some how.

I will say, our waiter was very friendly but he was a terrible waiter. It took him well over 10 minutes after my drink ran and me having to actually get up (flagging him down didn't work) and ask him for a refill. About 5 minutes after that, I finally got one, the thing is... There was something INCREDIBLY strange tasting about my drink. It was non alcoholic, a simple glass of water that tasted like swamp water. I gagged and spit it out. The smell of it was FOUL. 

To add on, the food was VERY mediocre for being in the $10-$15 a plate range. It was very bland and the spices weren't done quite right in my opinion. Again, coming from some one who grew up in New Mexico. 

The entire time, the manager kept giving us these odd looks, staring us down and making us feel uncomfortable. I thought it was all over, but it wasn't...

I had a family member pass through Phoenix and decide to eat here, they told me their story a bit too late however, I should have checked with them first knowing they've been through here. He told me that when he went here on a trip, they insisted on sitting him at the bar because he was alone and were very rude about it. They would not sit him at a table, even though he didn't want alcohol, only food.

The place is very poorly managed and that makes me very sad. I wish my great home state was better represented here in the Valley of the Sun. 

PLEASE BE WARNED, before eating here. You will be treated terribly and who knows what they might do to your food (or drink) if they don't like you.NEVER GOING BACK. the management is horrible. i ordered a VEGETARIAN black bean burrito.. cut open and start to take a bite, it was a steak burrito. that's fine.. simple mistake. they bring me my burrito. half way through my vegetarian black bean burrito, i pull a chuck of steak out of my mouth. i wasn't trying to make a scene but the manager should know because that type of mistake should not be happening in the kitchen. either the workplace was messy enough that a piece of steak got into my bean burrito.. or they were sharing spoons to scoop it. something. and the manader walked over and in a rude voice asked "what.. do you want another?" uhm.. no thank you my appetite is lost. and he just humphs his breath and says "fine i'll take it off" and walks away with nothing else said. I am not asking for free money but that is no way to handle customer service. if this same scenario happened with tomatoes and i was allergic i could sue. Or at least act apologetic and say you will go investigate the kitchen.This review is in regards to the home department ONLY! I purchased a comforter set and it was not on sale. I specifically asked the sales associate ( after I asked her for assistance), if I could have a price adjustment if it went on sale within the week. She assured me that they had a 30 day price guarantee. Of course, it did go on sale within a week & I brought in the sales receipt. The gentleman sales associate recruited the help of the manager & she informed me that the holiday help often makes errors & that they do not have any price adjustment policy! ( I always wondered why there were so many little yellow POP tickets on a lot of their merchandise!) It is ironic that with the $ that I was going to get back,I was going to purchase MORE merchandise! Instead, I returned all of it & I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from that department @ that location. I feel that the PV Dillard's is a better location anyway. The manager @ Arrowhead was arrogant, condescending and not in the least interested in me as a customer! She needs to go back and take a refresher class in customer service.Okay so I went in here today and I need to do couple of things I cannot find help anyway the employees were rude they said don't be right back and they never come back meanwhile I stand there for 15 minutes I continue looking from my things and not once did I get offered any help to start his big gigantic chaos mess stores dirty and no employees around to help you find things, also the parking lot is fairly small so you do have to park farther away into someone else's parking lot but they're all touching itches so many mom I would recommend going earlier in the morning but not in the afternoon. But it is Christmas and it is a mess.service awful, menu changed.  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes, there cream of corn is awful, there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know.  Also, there is no bread basket you have to ask for it, the food portions like pork chops has no bone, it is small, and the augratin potatoes is white, not baked and awful.Have been to this Boston Market with Friend's on 5 Different Occasion's and everytime we go there. All of our Side Order's are alway's COLD.

Cold Mashed Potatoe's, Cold Stuffing, etc, etc. And they serve you very, very Small Piece's of Chicken for the Price that they charge you. 
-$7.50 with Tax.

It's not worth it.

I have to admit the Food look's very seasoned and moist. 
But it's ALWAY'S COLD.

And they give you.....Small Piece's of Chicken. 

Sorry Gang, Save Your Money and Go Somewhere Else. 
Too Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD.I stopped into Helzberg this past week while killing time before work. The first time I walked in I was there for about 5 minutes and was not greeted by a single staff member. Not even a nod or wave to acknowledge my presence. There were a couple of customers in the store so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to return after I grabbed some lunch. Only because I spotted a nice watch. When I returned someone did help me right away but she was rude in the beginning.  She was conversing with her coworker on tasks they needed to complete. She didn't really take me seriously until she noticed I was  already wearing a Movado like herself. I narrowed my choices down to two watches but to my surprise a customer walked in to and interrupted our conversation to express her urgency to clean her ring.  The sales associate took the customer's ring and went to clean it and left me standing there. I walked out the store and will never return. I will find my watch elsewhere.Had a very poor experience last Friday. The wait to place your order was long and when a second person opened a register, she was RUDE! I ordered a turkey burger with no bun and a side salad (restricted diet) and she looked at me like I was crazy. When I said I wanted a 1/4 lb patty, she grunted, one size only. She omitted the cheese, even though I didn't ask for no cheese, and when I asked for salsa, pointed at the bar where I could get it myself. I had never eaten here before, so I was unaware it was available me there, no need to be rude. I was with two other people who ordered separate and by the time my dry, bland turkey party was called, my friends were done eating. I was then appalled to see that the woman who was so rude to me at the counter was apologizing to a table near me for an error with their food, so I am assuming she was some sort of leader at the facility. I am shocked that this woman was in any capacity to apologize for poor service. The only good interaction I had was with a female busses with long brown hair who asked to remove dishes and appeared to be working very hard. Needless to say, I will not be returning.Steer clear of this run down dump!!!! IDK where to start with this place. The people on United flight 93 were treated better than I was. Very SLOW service, VERY poor attitude. I can't stand bad service. If you don't want to wait tables or have to provide a service to customers go work somewhere else. I had to shave twice in betwixed refills. Also don't offer free refills and then get pissed when I drink more than one coke. Listen I'm not looking for Morton's here but the officer's club at the Four Oh Double Natural was in better shape than this place!You can tell there is no pride in ownership and that the person or persons who own this business try to get by a cheap as they can. Now hey I own a small business, I know you need to save money where you can, you just don't need to do it at the expanse of the customer. A business should thrive because of it's customers not in spite of it's customers. To see what I am talking about you only need to visit one of the other restaurants in this very strip mall. This place gives off the feeling that it is held together by popsicle sticks and chewing gum. I'm afraid that if I sneeze to hard the whole place will fall apart at the seams. It must have taken a lot of effort to make a place in a building this new look so run down. There were nicer places in Berlin at the end of ol WWII. Now on to the food. The worst part about coming to this place is having to eat at this place. I'm afraid to think of what I was really eating... I really have to wonder how Subway a few doors down can turn a profit and still use fresh bell peppers, onions and spinach and this place feels the need to use produce that was swept up off the floor after a busy lunch rush at said Subway. Again pride in ownership. The owners clearly feel that using cheap second rate ingredients is the only way to make money. It really sucks too because when you blow the dust and hair off of the menu they have some things that sound really really tasty. The price also makes you feel like you are in for a treat. The Pièce de résistance of this meal would be the hour I spent getting to know my toilet. I spent the first 20 minutes forcing out what resembled a can of Campbell's condensed cream of mushroom soup followed by what I can only describe as 40 minutes of dirty sock water.My husband and I decided to try this restaurant last week with our two children. It appeared to be" family friendly" as it sits in a strip mall next to a Fry's, but it was absolutely NOT. They served my (thankfully very well mannered) three and four year olds huge open water glasses. There is no child menu, but our waiter was kind enough to give my son half a portion. 

I ordered the cheese ravioli and my husband, the lasagna. We are not picky people at all, and those would seem like safe dishes, but they were awful. My husband swears this is the Costco lasagna we purchased a while back.. and based on a previous review, it is from Costco. The bruschetta was not worth ordering, either. We tried hard to find something to like, but it just didn't happen.

The service was decent, but we will not return.Total rip off!!
$16.95 for a banana creme pie.  Recently, they changed the presentation of the pie to feature a dome of whipped cream.  Once you cut in to enjoy the pie you soon find out it is 75% cream and maybe one or two bananas and some not so tasty yellow custard.  After being a customer for ten years I will never go back.
Yuck!  Gross!!Only giving one star because zero is not avail!!  Told it was excellent. Service absolutely sucked and we were ready to walk out after waiting so long when someone finally helped.  While eating, a roach crawled across the table and I almost threw up.  Stopped eating, paid the bill and NEVER returned!This place cost just under $100. It was the first place we saw for a while and we were exhausted. The room was adequate but lacked in pillows, towels, soap, and no conditioner. The "continental" breakfast consisted of weak coffee and day old bagels. No fruit or any other options which doesn't work if you can't eat gluten products. The staff doesn't seem interested to interact with anyone and even made my teenage daughter feel uncomfortable. I was devastated when I traveled no more than 15 minutes down the road in the morning and found several affordable places in Avondale. Keep on driving past this place.Just went in and had the absolute worst customer service ever at subway. Just because you probably got stuck working a Sunday night doesn't mean you have to emit that bitterness to the customer. I walked in and waited forever for someone to come out from back. Then someone finally came and this skinny white dude didn't even acknowledge my prescence. No hi, nothing! Long story short the kid made my sandwich with attitude. Never makes for a yummy sandwich! Now it's a shit sandwich which I'm still going to eat because I'm hungry! Ha. Then he checks me out and doesn't even hand me my sandwich and bag, I had to practically reach  over the counter to get it. Maybe if you're so unhappy with your life you should do something about it!Wow, dirty bathrooms, dirty concession stand. Just eww."MEthinks not?"  NO!! I KNOW NOT!!  This Chili's will not get another dollar from my pocket.  

I have given them 3 and 4 chances and it NEVER gets better.  Every meal has come to me cold.  The drinks.....BAD. Even desert sucked.  I am a very fair person and I have given them the last chance.  

The service is even lacking......the servers spend more time playing with each other rather than doing their jobs.  It is more than frustrating to hear that your food is up and they are giggling about the GREAT time they had the night before in the club's bathroom with some random guy.  

While I enjoy a great "club bathroom sex story" like the next girl....I would prefer that I had hot GOOD food while I am hearing about it and trying to explain to my 10 year old that it IS NOT OK to do that!!  LMFAO!!

Again.....don't waste your money, time, or taste buds on this particular Chili's.BUT!!!  If you are looking for a good time story and cold ass shrimp this is the place for you!Service was adequate.  Ambience was fair.  Food was poor.  Funghi al Forno appetizer tasted like sawdust stuffed mushrooms.  My wife's salad was OK but too much dressing.  My lentil soup was just fair, with little flavor.  My wife had scampi in marsala sauce and the flavor was too sweet.  I had Frutti de Mare - linguini with variety of seafood.  My main course was incredibly blasé.  Not what I expected for Italian food.  The cheapest bottle of wine was $30.00.  The entire meal with tip was pushing $100.  Definitely not worth it.  Wished I had gone to Quiznos.My wife and I have been looking at this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a try tonight.  She ordered the fillet w lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  I choose the 16oz porter house with baked potato and dinner salad.  Both steaks were very tough.  For the "prime" cuts of beef that they were said to be, these didn't come close to what you'd expect for a top quality steak house.  The dinner salad was close to frozen, the bread was very dry, the lobster tail was good, but nothing special.  The service was average.  All in all, we were sorely disappointed and I'm sure we won't return.Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!If I could give this place NO STARS I would. My brothers and I took my Mom their once for their birthday and waited about 30 minutes for someone else with the same amount of people in their party to get seated before us when they had arrived after. The girl that was in charge of putting us down on the list totally forgot to do so. We only figured this out when my brother when to ask her how much longer we would be waiting she looked at him super confused like what are you talking about your not on the list but with out having to say anything. I got so mad that we just left and went ac cross the street to Friday's unfortunately is not longer open. I will not be going their ever again tried to report them to corporate and I couldn't find a way to do it.Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. 

I do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get.We use to love this place....but we will never be back again after two consecutive trips of lousy service and food.  

One visit, I ordered pesto sauce with pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, that was the only part done right.  The pesto had no flavor.  I was a watery green thin and oily sauce.  Didn't taste basil or nuts of any kind.  By far the worst pesto sauce I have ever had!   The portion was a joke too!  All the pasta on my dish could fit inside my baby's 8 oz bottle!  I'm not a big eater by any means, this was a perfect portion for me, but for the price there should had been at least double the amount of food!

They use to have a mango ice tea that was really good, but they did not have it the last couple of visits.  The bread is ok, but the entree doesn't come with soup or salad, something just doesn't seem right with that.  For the price they charge, dessert should be included!  

My children each ordered a kids meal, grilled chicken breast was very thinly sliced, about as thick as two quarters, so it was over cooked, burnt and bland.  Don't even bother with it!  Spaghetti and meat sauce was also bland!!  The kids size meal was the the same size as my meal, but half the price!

My boss treated us last week, again, poor poor experience.  Very consistent with the previous visit, but we were at the Bell Road location.  Portion was very small, I guess they want everyone to eat less pasta because its a fatten food.  They want you to really feel like you are in Europe!   Children's entree, chicken tenders,  was again over cooked and dry.   My shrimp pasta dish had 5 pieces of shrimp for $16.99!  Do I feel rip off!  

Good Bye to Mac Grill, you are a Closed Chapter.I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.The only times that I have gone here was because we had a family gathering and some nut always picks this place.

I do not like it ...at all. I have gotten sick after eating here twice and the service has always been terrible.First of all, I would like to acknowledge that this review has nothing to do with the staff. Our waitress was very pleasant, friendly, and attentive, as was every other staff member with whom we interacted. The positives ended there, though. The salsa is probably the most bland salsa I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for spicier salsa, and it wasn't any better-- and definitely was NOT spicy. Onto our meals. Very overpriced, to begin with. $11 to choose 2 items off of an a la carte menu? Seriously? My husband thought his meal was just okay (chicken enchilada and chile relleno), but the enchilada sauce was horribly bland. I ordered the vegetable fajitas. They brought out the standard fajita plate (guac, sour cream, tomatos, lettuce, beans, tortillas), but the vegetable fajita dish was steamed broccoli, squash, and zuccinni with absolutely no seasonings. I've NEVER had a Mexican restaurant serve me plain steamed broccoli for fajitas! I asked about the traditional fajita vegetables (the grilled, seasoned peppers and onions) and was told that I would have to pay extra for a side of them. Wait... I ordered veggie fajitas but actual fajita veggies cost extra?? By the end of the meal, we had paid almost $30 when we could have had a better "Mexican" meal at Taco Bell for $7. I won't be going back to Macayo's... even if someone else is picking up the tab.I am so torn on this review...we chose to use Cynthia and Desert Oasis for our wedding because it was in close proximity to everything. We had arranged all flowers for the big day except for the cake. About a month before the big day, we arranged to have four dozen rose buds for the layers on our cake, in addition to our previously arranged order. The flowers for the wedding party, as well as our parents, and my bouquet, were simply gorgeous. However, when we got to our reception site, we had ten rose buds. We received only a quarter of the amount for which we had placed the order. I never did receive any kind of receipt for the additional flowers, which is my fault. However, four dozen roses is not cheap, and I was stuck with over $100 worth of additional costs - and a paltry looking wedding cake. It was embarrassing, and very costly.Closed!!!These guys are as uncooperative and inconvienent as you can get. If you rent with a debit card they will hassle you to no end. Two utility bills proving you are at said address and bank statement of proof of connection to debit card. Thats a lot of personal information they dont need and unethical employees could swipe this information easily. The women there are just idiots and have no friendliness or able to accomodate anything. DONT EVER GO HERE!!! The car selection is bad too.Took my dog here. It was the only place that doesn't require proof of shots. Pretty decent for my poor side. I can't cut my dogs nails cause they are black and I clip them too close and make him bleed every time I try. They gave him back to me and all seemed okay. Got him in the truck and he starts bleeding everywhere. Really I could have done that myself and save the gas and the cost of it. I won't be going back here. They get 1 star just because you don't need proof of shots to bring your animal thereWORST.PHARMACY.EVER.  Do yourself a favor and go to Wallgreens or CVS up the street. Nasty attitudes and incompetence are not winning qualities, folks!Horrible office.  They upcharge you and lie to your face.So I looked throughly on here to find a well priced nail salon with good reviews and I ended up at this place. The positive part of this review is that the man that did my nails was nice....
First it started off negative, I'm not a fan of salons that wedge off your nails for removal, I very much preferred when they spend time & soak them off. But if you don't care then this place is your style.
Second, I got a pink & white new full set. I'm not from AZ originally but I thought it was excessive to have a pink & white cost around $40. On top of that my right thumb nail was rounded on the edges, my left middle finger was thick with a lump like it had a tumor, and the man put gel automatically on my nails without even asking & then of course didn't mention this and tacked it on my total. 
I'm all for spending $ for quality, but $50 for a removal, new pink & white, unwanted gel, and globby nails should NOT cost this much!Horrible food.Bad Service.Great location.Good for a beer or drink nothing more.The food is scary bad and disgusting to even look at.No flavor ,bland or dried out.YUCK!!
Dont plan on anything other than spending the night on the tiolet iafter you eat that food.Steer clear from their fish tacos! They were absolutely horrible!  The side of rice and beans were tasteless! Chips and salsa were good and that was it!Service & food sucked. Walked in with a group of 13 people and was told by the bus boy to seat ourselves. After literally 10 minutes, we were finally able to sit down after my family members rearranged different tables around to accommodate. Not once during this whole time did the servers offer to help; instead, they walked around us pretending to be busy (the restaurant was almost completely empty). I made the mistake of ordering fish tacos in Arizona... The tilapia was disgustingly FISHY and no amount of squeezed lemon was able to save it. I also had to ask for more corn tortillas from the kitchen because the original ones that came wrapped around it were completely soaked through from the rice and beans (to the point where I couldn't even pick them up--they all fell apart). Margaritas were ok, as were the salsa, chips & quesadilla that we had as apps. Came here last year (when we again stayed at the Wig Wam Resort across the street) and forgot about how less than mediocre this place was.  If it wasn't for my FIL not wanting to drive, we definitely wouldn't come back here. Now we know. Blegh.Bartender are super Rude !!!! And they take for ever to bring you a drink that is if u lucky enough to get service . And they get mad if you don't tip  Them but why would u tip for a horrible  service We never going back again !  Taps next door to them is way nicer and they always give you a great service super cool people and the food is great .don't waist you money here not worth it.Worst zoo I've ever been too. Way over priced for a filthy facility. Will never waste my money here again. The only nice thing I can say is that all of the staff are very friendlySaw this place was advertising on Groupon with a $23 Adult Admission into the park, so I thought I'd give this zoo a visit! The normal admission for an adult would usually be $32, which would have definitely been way overpriced.

It's not the worst zoo that I've ever been to, but it's nowhere near even average.

The overall vibe I got from the place was that of loneliness and depression. There was barely anybody in the park on a Saturday around 4PM and none of the restaurants in the park were open for business save for Dillon's BBQ, which sits at the entrance of the park. Only half of the rides placed throughout the park were actually running, while the carousel loomed silently in front of the small mammal building and the boat ride that ran around the kangaroo habitat looked to have been abandoned for quite some time.

The exhibits are spread out pretty far, so you might find yourself walking pretty far between displays without seeing much of anything...except for BIRDS. As mentioned in other reviews, the answer to empty space in this park is filling it with habitats full of birds. I've never seen so many birds at a zoo in my life!

A lot of the animals looked miserable, which I thought to be understandable since some of the enclosures looked so filthy and ill-maintained. The alligator enclosure near the kids area was particularly bad, as the glass was so dirty as well as the inside of the display that I couldn't necessarily tell it was an alligator inside at first.

Speaking of the exhibits, i would say that a lot of the displays are far too small for the animals being held. Perhaps the most grueling example of this was a small turtle enclosure by the west entrance of the park. I peered into the pond and saw a turtle eating the carcass of another turtle in the pool. I had to keep myself from throwing up! It was horrific! 

There's also a lot of "Construction" being done on this place, with what looked to be new habitats coming in for the jaguars and otters...as well as a whole new portion of the park to be called "Adventure Land". They should perhaps focus on re-upping  the facilities they already have before adding more.

The saving grace of this attraction is the aquarium. Even though it's also not the greatest aquarium in the world, it's pretty neat to walk around and take in. It's maintained far better than the zoo and most of the displays are pretty neat to look at! The sea lions habitat is a bit small for three of them to be living in, but otherwise it's much more enjoyable then the depressing side of the zoo. 

Overall, I can't recommend this zoo. The aquarium is worth a visit, but not for $32.If zero stars we're possible, oh would I ever. Not only did they screw up what I ordered, they couldn't even take responsibility.I went here recently for dinner with my family and about 5 minutes after our appetizer arrived so did our dinner so we didn't even get a chance to enjoy our first round. The steak I ordered was way undercooked when I asked for medium well, It was so red it was dripping.  Our server was very nice about the situation but it was the manager that had an attitude.  The manager explained to me that medium well takes a long time to cook and that's why my new steak was taking so long.. Of course I know that it takes a long time. That's why I was surprised it came out so quick. Terrible service from the manager and I won't be returning.I stopped there the Friday before Easter to get a pedicure.  Imagine my surprise when they would not allow my service dog (diabetes alert dog) in their establishment.  Three women came charging at us as we came in the door, screaming and pointing at my service dog "GET DOG OUT!"  The dog was wearing a service coat. I tried to explain, but they kept pointing and screaming at me.  Other customers tried to help me, but they would not relent.  I finally left, went a block away and my dog was received warmly.  I had left word for the owner to call me.  He called me at 10:00 PM (I was in bed) to tell me that his employees were scared of dogs and that he would not allow ANY dogs in his shops (this is a chain).  He didn't care if she was a service dog.  I've NEVER been treated this way by ANY establishment that I take my dog in. Bottom line: if you have a service dog, you will not be allowed access with your dog in Bien Nails.  I will NEVER go there again, and will do all I can to let people know what happened.Well, it's outback so you know what you are going to get.  It's place was okay the first time, then 2 days later horrible.  Everything was sooooooo salty (especially the blooming onion, we couldn't even eat it).  Then, when the waitress came around and asked how everything was, we told her it was too salty and what did she say? "Oh, but its so good" and walked away.  Really? That's what you say?  They forgot my cousin's horseradish crust on the rib eye steak, then brought it out 15 min later on a plate and slid it onto the steak (and it got all crumbled and fell apart).  I can't believe it.  Lucky for them, there are so few decent places in Surprise people choose to eat at this dump.  Never going back.Wow...the Pizza Hut in Surprise at 13706 W. Bell Rd. in Surprise, AZ, (store #27003) is probably the most unprofessional Pizza Hut I've ever encountered. Here's what happened. Tonight, my family and friends placed a sizable order via the internet. I called when our order was 15 minutes late and was told the driver was enroute with our order, that they had been "waiting for drivers to return". I called when it was still another 10 minutes late, and "Nathan" the "manager" told me that the order was just going out. I told Nathan that I'd already been told that 10 minutes previously, and he said, "This time he is getting your order out." I asked his name, and he refused to give me his last name. I told him I was going to contact corporate, and he said, "This isn't a corporate store, so YOU HAVE FUN WITH THAT!" and he hung up on me.

When I called back to ask to speak to the owner, I was put on hold for over 20 minutes. While being on hold, the pizza delivery driver named Shareef arrived and said, "I brought you a free 2-liter of soda to make up for the problems." We REFUSED THE ENTIRE ORDER. I then called the store using my back line and the phone was answered immediately. So that tells me they put me on hold as some sort of joke, refusing to either transfer me to the owner or take a message. I assumed the owner would not be in at this hour, but that I could have left a message for them.

At this time the charge is still pending on my credit card, even though we refused the order (which was over an hour past it's delivery time). My credit card company will be doing a charge back on it should this Pizza Hut location try to rip me off. Given their unprofessional behavior, I wouldn't put it past them.

The "manager" is named Nathan, the owner is named Rachel, although they refused to give me a last name or employee number. I called the store back to get the store number, and they hung up on me again.

Two other people that had put me on indefinite hold were Paulina (when I called back to try again to leave a message for the owner) and Shawn (when I called to discuss having my credit card charges removed.) SO unprofessional. I've had to let the Fraud Prevention Department at my credit card company know that any fraudulent activity that happens from this point forward could easily be a result of these unprofessional workers. It's concerning when what seems to be a reputable corporation turns out to be a bunch of morons.

Update:  Now that midnight has passed, I see they refused to refund the credit card charges, although no merchandise was received.  Buyers beware.  Save yourself the hassle and order from a reputable company.Went here and they were rude and charged different prices then on the menu and they told us it was because we ordered something off menu but we asked for what was on there. be aware dining here.This is NOT NY PIZZA!

I came here only once for lunch, and tried the pizza here for the first time. 2 slices of sausage, and a dinner salad. Both slices were thicker than your basic delivery chain pizza. The pizza was very thick crust, puffy and chewy, and the sausage was little balls of meat that tasted like it was from a frozen pizza. 

Overall the pizza was NOT very good!

This place should never call itself a NY Pizza joint. Thick crust IS NOT NY PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! 

Wow it's truly is a crime to call this NY Pizza!Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour.
Long story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was "Sorry."  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again.The hairdressers are all very young and inexperienced, with no older folk to guide them or show them how to cut hair.  I tried to explain how my ends need to be cut, but neither of the two employees had ever heard of such a thing.  I have had this certain type of cut from a few different hairdressers, and it's perfect for my type of hair.  I have had some other hairdressers insist on something else, and it always looks horrid.  I am open to certain changes, permutations, and differences here and there, but there is a specific way that the ends of my hair really need to be cut.

So anyway, the two kids get together and decide that I'm crazy, and they convince me to let them do it "the right way".  I have to admit that it's my fault because it was Sunday afternoon, and I didn't feel like waiting for an appointment with a better establishment.  I just asked them to leave like an extra inch, just in case I needed to cut more to make it right.  They ended up giving me a very stupid-looking cut.  I actually had to cut it some more when I got home.  My home-cut involved standing backwards in front of a large mirror, holding a smaller mirror in my left hand, and using the scissors with my right hand.

Luckily, the skill level of the hairdresser was so low that there was not much for me to mess up.  It's just a straight line across the back.  Nothing was done to the sides, and she did not create a shape of any type along the back.  I paid thirty bucks with tip for a straight line that goes right across my back.  I could have gotten my boyfriend to do it.Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, "You can have whatever you want."

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)Here Is the synopsis.

1. Walked in at 4 pm. THREE employees walked by us and COMPLETELY ignored us. A server came out after 10 minutes and asked us how many. He grabbed menus and literally left us 20 feet behind him. We assumed he wanted us to follow him.
2. On RECOMMENDATION we ordered two appetizers. Calamari and artichoke dip. The artichoke dip was ok. The calamari I GUARANTEE is a very low end pre breaded frozen product. It was WAY overcooked therefore chewy and tough.
3. Daughter ordered a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Dressing was a very odd texture. Overly thick and odd taste.
4. Entrees were Pizza...it was decent. Spicy sausage pasta.....it was laughable very poor quality. Tortellini Alfredo...it was decent. Pesto Chicken pasta...it had ZERO flavor. I do not know how that can happen but it did.
5. Three out of the four sets of silverware we were given had food remnants stuck to them. We asked for new silverware. Server response was "Oh Boy" New silverware arrived...getting better tis time two out of the three were dirty.  We wiped off the silverware with our napkins and went on.

All in all very disappointed. We had medium hopes and were totally let down.Look, let's face it, Maggie Moo. You never even stood a chance.

Your flavors are pedantic and unimaginative, your service is lackluster and disheartening, and your prices defy logic.

It's fucking ice cream, and not even good ice cream. I wouldn't know. Maybe if you took better care maintaining your merchandise, it wouldn't taste so terrible.

Whether the flavor's "too soft" or "too hard" it requires you take the reserve tray out of the freezer and serve some of that to me instead. 

So apparently your display case is just that. Display.

Your mix-ins are lame and stale. M&M's and sprinkles? Gee, don't give yourself a fucking aneurysm with all this creativity. 

So you really didn't have much going for you already by the time your cashier called me "sir". TWICE. 

The second time was my fault though. I tried to intervene and correct her.

"is that all for you, sir?"
"Um...it's ma'am, actually. I'm a girl."
"Oh. I'm sorry, sir!"

If I hadn't said anything I would've only been offended the one time. Mea culpa.

It's not entirely that girl's fault I'm giving you one star, but it certainly helped convince.

You'd be well informed to know I'm writing a letter. Not to your manager or anything. 

But to Coldstone Creamery. Begging them back.

I figure why be with a knock-off of a piece of garbage when I can just be with the real deal, you know.

Ha ha! Who am I kidding. 

This one event will probably deter me from ice cream all together. 

I'll need to set "Gelato & Frozen Custard" on the "Ice Cream Orientation" box on all my social profiles.I loved the classes - however - when you quit, prepare yourself for an epic battle to stop paying.  After fulfilling my 2 year contract, I cancelled my membership in person.  I signed all forms, dotted all i's, crossed all t's.  My credit card continued being billed.  I called, I came in, I disputed with my CC company - still kept being billed.  I am still fighting to stop being sucked dry of $24 each month for a gym that I can no longer use since I am not a member!  

Biggest.  scam.  ever.Our server was awesome but the food was horrible, and what I mean by that is it wasn't very sanitary. I ordered a baked potato and when I was spreading my butter I noticed something hard and black in it. My husband took it out and cracked it open and it seemed to be a hard piece of mold. Management insisted that it was a burnt piece of steak and it obviously wasn't, i'm not too sure how a burnt piece of steak would end up in a container of butter, and besides, why would they allow anything to do with meat around dairy products during preparation, wouldn't that be a type of cross-contamination?? Never will I eat at this restaurant again, and I feel maybe they should be visited by a health inspector.I've never had a meal here that didn't result in diarrhea afterward. Nothing more needs to be said.Dirtiest  jack in the box ever!!  I grew eating jack in the box an this is a Peru excuse for one.I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!

When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like "trendy-young-and-cool" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. 

The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....

I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.I have to say I have been there a few times before and had a blast. 
This time it was was such a let down. I took my kids thinking they would do what they are known for the show. We got our soup/ salad and in 5 min the guy came to make out food. No tricks no nothing. He made the rice. No flavor at all. The steak and chicken was to dry. We were there all for about 30 min. The manager gave me. 10% off my bill. Not much at all. I don't like spending 114.00 and not getting great service. I will never be back. Over all the worst place I have been to in a long time.I agree with the posts here that the Starbucks inside this Barnes & Noble is not a welcoming place. Most of the staff people I've seen are brusk, rude, and unhelpful. Right now I'm sitting here watching the dark-haired worker behind the counter. I stood for a while trying to order, but she ignored me, working on some coffee. Never even a "I'll be with you in a minute" acknowlegement. I finally walked away and sat down with a book. As soon as I left she started serving people. I'm expecting one of the staff to come over and ask me to buy something, as has happened before. I'd like to tell them that the snot behind the counter ignored me. Maybe she didn't like my looks. Who knows? I've had this kind of experience before at this Starbucks and fed up with the staff here. They need a little customer service training.I called for delivery and to my surprise I ordered the combo to be delivered of 18.95 plus tax the man on the other end tells me I owe 30.54 after tax I only added 2 toppings? Please help me figure out what crack this place is smoking! I hung up!I went to the drive through, picked up my food went down the road. I took a bite into the hamburger and the top bun was rock solid and could not even eat it. So I took the bun off and took another 2-3 bites and the Tomatoes were not tasting to good!. So I stopped eating the food as it was Not a Good Sign!This place is terrible.  

Awful beer selection.  Nice enough (if not braindead) servers.  Nauseating clientele.  

Won't be going back.Went for dinner on a Saturday night.  First time at a Hooters.  I had heard the food was great, especially the Steamers.  
No steamers on the menu.  I ordered Mahi tacos.  Two tacos, 8 dollars.  No sides, just tacos.  The worst food I have ever had.  Smelled fishy, tasted fishy......which means OLD fish.  I ate one because I was hungry, but felt sick all evening.  I had to take a bite of my husbands Burger to get the fish taste out of my mouth.  I ate a few of his fries, would have eaten more, but they were dry and cold like they had been sitting under a heat lamp way too long.  WE WILL  NEVER GO TO A HOOTERS AGAIN. !!!

MHI don't get all the wonderful reviews. I was really disappointed with the food and the 20 minute wait for one small salad and one sandwich. The house dressing on the salad was probably the worst I've had at a Greek restaurant and the steak sandwich was just ok. Can't imagine we'll be back.The whole expierience was not what I expected it to be. Clear case of not judging a book by it's cover. Sometimes when you start things off on a bad note, things only go downhill from there. The place looks great when you walk in, very nice decor happy people galore. We had a party of two and were told it was going to be 15 minutes which was fine seeing it was new years eve and everywhere was packed. It was more like 20, which is fine unless parties of 4 or more that came in 10 minutes after you are being sat first. When we said something 30 seconds later we were brought to our table. I would have rather sat at the bar seeing it was a small table in a awkward place. Still looked pretty decent, minus what looked like a leaky roof with missing tiles and stains. The chips were good, the salsa was trying to hard with the whole roasted  chipotle thing and was not that good. But we were hungry and finished pretty much the whole small bowl before we were even offered drinks (10-15 min). Strike 2! So My wife ordered a Draft american beer. It tasted horible, something was wrong with the tap. We told the waiter and instantly he said, "it tastes like copper right?" How are you guys going to know something is wrong and do nothing about it. He suggested that we stuck with mexican beer because there is no problem with that tap, My wife ordered a bottled beer. We ordered our food right away, I had the sonoran which was a shredded beef burro, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale, and my wife had stuffed chicken. My burro was covered in 50 cent nacho cheese, and filled with meat that was unseasoned and bland. My wifes dish was decent, could have been better, was a little to stong tasting on the seasoning. We asked for the check immediatly, and could tell by the three tables around us, that we were not alone in this bad expierience. They push this place off like it's authentic, it's really just crappy tex mex food. Go to Macayos, or even Garcias for better food, prices, and expierience.Restaurant is nice. We got the #2 enchilada plate which is the shredded beef enchiladas and the Monterrey plate. Everything was pretty disgusting. It tasted like what my cats food smells like. We had a bunch left overs that we had no desire to take to go. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach later in the night. The only decent thing they had was the chips and salsa.I ordered take out, so this review won't include customer service, etc. My coworker and I ordered orange chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup and crab puffs. Every single thing was completely disappointing. The orange chicken had a thick marmalade texture and did not taste very good. The fried rice was just what the name is--fried rice. There weren't onions, scrambled eggs, peas or carrots. I would have been better off ordering white rice; pretty much the same thing. The egg drop soup was not very good either. And the crab puffs hardly had any filling. I was really craving Chinese food at the time and I was so disappointed when I took those first bites. I won't be trying this place again.What a disgrace this Restaurant is. The minute we walked in, their was a "bunch" of Teenager Employee's hanging around laughing and doing Nothing. When the floor and the table's were dirty. It looked like a "bunch of kid's hanging out". They ALL walked in the back room, when they seen us, walk in with "our family". 

We bought a "Foot Long Roast Beef Sandwich" and a Bag of Chip's. The Kid said, "He did not have any White Bread". I could only choose Wheat or Rye Bread. Well, we don't like Wheat or Rye Bread. But we took Wheat Bread. Then "Our Sandwich had such "Paper, Paper-Thin" Meat and Cheese inside of it. It was disgusting. I felt like we PAID for a BUNCH of LETTUCE, TOMATOE'S AND PICKLE'S WITH BREAD". It was Terrible.

The Cheese and the Meat were PAPER, PAPER-THIN. It was a JOKE !

And the Potatoe Chip's are Like $1.00 Each and ALL YOU GET, is a 1/4 of a Bag. Come On, Mr. Good Cent's. Quit Ripping Off the People. Never, again.I was very disappointed.  My wife I tried Fuzzy's based on the reviews and both of us found this pizza to be below par.  Nothing like good Chicago pizza.  We ordered a sausage and mushroom 16" and I think we got 12 mushrooms and 8 pieces of sausage.  The pizza had lots of cheese but very little flavor.  We won't be back.Wow.. where do I even begin. Last night we ordered a pizza (with pepperoni mushrooms and olives), 2 salads, the baked ziti, and an Italian beef sandwich. 

First off, the pizza was an absolute atrocity. Undercooked flat crust, bland marinara, and canned mushrooms. The pie was cut in to random squares. THIS IS NOT CHICAGO style anything. This is something I'd order at a budget hotel in Las Vegas at 3am after a night of gambling and binge drinking and put in the microwave!! This pizza couldn't even pass for bar food in the seediest of bars. I ate one piece (square) and I literally threw the pizza in the trash, which is where it belongs. Complete garbage.

Secondly, the baked ziti came in a styrofoam container lined with aluminum foil. WTF? Who takes pasta and piles it on to aluminum foil with mozzarella and bakes it? Even Domino's pizza doesn't do this and they're 4 times cheaper than this sad excuse for a restaurant. Most restaurants would give you an aluminum container with a proper lid. You know the kind of container where when you dig in to it with a fork you're not getting pieces of aluminum in your mouth!! The pasta was edible once you removed the aluminum flakes from the melted and burnt on cheese. 

The worst part about the baked ziti is I found a black inch long nylon bristle from a brush or cleaning utensil in the marinara. Unfortunately it made it in to my mouth. I threw the ziti in the trash next to the pizza. There's no excuse for poor food handling. Train your cooks.

The Italian beef sandwich was well seasoned, and sliced thin. Problem? It showed up with no cheese, no garnishments, nothing. It was literally dry meat on a dry bun. Thankfully we had some stuff in the fridge to spruce it up. Tossed it in the oven for 10 mins and ate that. 

They deserve ZERO stars. I won't order from this place again.their 'thin crust' is not... it is hard cracker crust. NO Flavor. 

The toppings and sauce were fine but the crust was bad... and I love good thin crust (chewy, very thin, italian style)Horrible costumer service. Didn't even want to be bothered. Was rude and ignored me. Also very small store and not enough employees working. I was left holding my baby in her car seat for ever until i got help.If I could give a half star, I would and that would be ONLY because our waitress, Phoenicia, was really sweet and tried to make things better. 

It started out pretty good, we walked in at 8 pm and so it was Happy hour and you get $2 of per shake, so my husband ordered a Strawberry Shake. That came out fairly quickly and it was very good. Then we ordered, my husband ordered a cup of chili, the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy, I ordered the pineapple teriyaki burger, I asked that it be made the same way as the menu stated, no extra items such as lettuce, tomato or onion.  I went with the seasoned fries.

The chili came out and though good, my husband said it was quite spicy, which he wasn't expecting from a diner style restaurant.  And then we waited, it seemed to take a really long time for our meals to come out.

When they did it all went downhill from there. The meatloaf was funny tasting and drenched in a really odd tasting gravy, and the potatoes tasted like maybe they were really old...several days old maybe?  We sent the meal back as inedible.  My burger had to be cleaned off of lettuce and onion and in the process the mayo kind of disappeared. It was ok, but every few bites I kept thinking did they use rancid butter to toast the bun?  It was not real tasty but we were starving, so we shared that. The french fries were cold and had NO SEASONING. 

I've been to many 5 & Diners in the valley, I will NOT be returning to this one.  We also nearly froze to death and the music that was playing was very boring and unrecognizable, we were born in the 50's I would have thought there would have been something we knew.

I wouldn't waste my money on this one, ever again.After we checked in we discovered the toilet was clogged and the shower wouldn't drain. Also the wi-fi was very spotty. When I called the front desk, they brought me a plunger. When my bf went to use the restroom in the office the next morning, the manager Melanie or Melody could care less. She never apologized or seemed to care. Her main concern was that the credit card was declined for a second night, we never authorized her to charge another night. When I asked for her boss she said the owner couldn't be bothered. The manager had possibly the most deplorable customer service skills I'd ever seen.This place was right off the main street and looked like it might have been promising. The restaurant was decorated in a country style which is ok but it was kind of dingy.  The booths were very worn and it just didn't look well kept. I had the guacamole cheeseburger with fries and it looked like I could have made it from home. The burger was under cooked, the so called cheddar was nothing more than a kraft single and the guacamole tasted like it came out of a bag. The fries looked like they came out of the frozen section from the super market. The food was sad and unimpressive. The service was ok and the people seemed friendly enough. All in all this place was a disappointment and I will be skipping it next time.Used to be good.The last few years this place has really gone downhill. The food is very bland, no taste what so ever. Taco bell is preferred over this place, and many of the locals will tell you that it is not good like it used to be.Taco Bell is more authentic and tastes better than this place and is right down the road(and by the way, we hate Taco Bell) Save your money and time. Service was sloooooow, the meat in the taco salad tasted like it was microwaved, the shell bowl that it was in was stale, the quesadilla was not a quesadilla at all. It had no cheese inside of it, was covered in enchilada sauce and never touched a grill. The only positive thing we can say is that the draft beer was cold. The decor is very outdated, the triple seat cushions gave me the heebee Jeebees, and did I mention how awful the food is?A tour guide who has been living in Sedona for over 20 years highly recommended this restaurant to us. So we tried it. My husband was very excited when he heard they had the best steak and seafood.  The prices of the entrees were very high. Almost everything was in the $30 dollar range.  My husband ordered Seabass, my son ordered Gumbo, I ordered salmon and my daughter ordered a cheeseburger.  Honestly, nothing was that great. Just ok. Well, for the price charged, 'just ok" isn't good enough. Even the bloody mary wasn't good. Our bill was $122. plus not including tip. I would never return to this restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it to others.  Also, there isn't even a view. For these prices, I would expect at least a view. LOLWow, I don't know where everyone else ate, but this had to be the worst experience ever. Food and service was so horrible I didn't even notice the view. First off we requested a seat outside, which was taken care of quickly. Our drink orders were taken and then the server came to inform us the bartender was backed up, mind you we only ordered two beers and two glasses of wine and they weren't that busy. Then we noticed several other people getting seated around us and getting their drinks. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen. Weather got a little cooler and we weren't feeling the love outside, so we requested to be moved indoors, not a big problem, but nobody informed our waitress. We finally got our drinks, asked for bread, actually asked three times and on the fourth request received but at this time we were almost done eating.
The food served was definitely not worth the prices they were charging, maybe they were including the scenary in the price, but it was horrible, I ordered fish, it was dry, no flavor at all, tasted a little freezer burnt. My husband ordered a rib eye, which when it arrived, was something else and not cooked per his request. They give you an ice cream scoop size of mashed potatoes and three stalks of asparagaus with your entree that they are charging 34.00 a plate. We had to ask several different people for water, bill, etc. Terrible experience, old decor, smelly inside, chairs uncomfortable, bathrooom was gross. What can I say it was all BAD!!!!!!  Highly recommend anywhere but Shugrue's. If you want the view, get some take out and eat in the parking lot!!!!Bad service, cold foodOver priced less than average food, wait staff was nice and the corn bread they serve before the meal is the best part of it. And the pie was good but really no better than what you get at the store and bake yourself. My boyfriend got country fried steak and I got a french dip both were mediocre. We both had cokes and split a slice of pie. Our total was $43 and so totally not worth it. We only went in the first place because we had a gift card. Do yourself a favor and just go to the cheesecake factory.It used to be pretty good when the previous owners ran it, (you can see who they were, their picture is still on the wall on the left).
The portions are smaller, service is slower and it isn't the same by any means. I used to LOVE the Shrimp Pad Thai, but it's not even close to what it was.
There are only a few booths for patrons to sit down and dine in, but now there is a hand written sign on the walls, "Clean up your plates before you leave"
Shouldn't you be happy people are dining in your place of business? that sign seems very unfriendly and unwelcoming. It only takes a few seconds to bus a persons plates, but there aren't even plates used, they are those cheap cheap cheap dollar store styrofoam plates, low budget, low quality....
It used to be good here, not anymore. I've enjoyed the food quality here while it lasted.Dog Track.

One of the worse courses I've played and after reading the reviews it must be a just us eh?  

We played as non-residents, when we called for reservations we didn't think to ask about the conditions but the ProShop should have given a heads up or offered a discount on the green fees.  We found out they were 2 weeks away from overseeding but already the course has gone to shhhit - maybe they're rationing the water here with the drought but at times it was like hitting out of an alley way or stuck in mud (in the fairway!).  It DID NOT look like the pictures on the website.

Staff were lethargic and unresponsive - why have 5 guys standing around at the tent if they're not going to wipe clubs, get a cart or provide even a towel to cool off.  On the front 9 we didn't see a cart girl - we saw her once on the back. 

We took our time teeing off since there wasn't anyone behind or after us, but we soon caught up with a group of 3 - even after skipping a hole to get a head, there were several other groups playing at a snails pace with no push from the marshal.  It's called Ready Golf - I don't want to spend 5 and half hours in 95 degree heat when there's only 25 people playing on the course.  Insane. 

I will say there's some nicely laid out holes and if the course wasn't brown and chopped up - there could have been a better time.  Regardless I won't be back and it won't be on my recommendations list next time I'm in town.1st time staying at Sunset Station despite visiting it many times over the years - family in the area. OK room but noisy adjacent room plumbing kept us awake all night -bit like staying in a cheap motel.
Beware the Resort Amenity Fee aka hidden tax
Doesnt matter if you use any "amenities" or not - the "fee "( $17 per day! ) is always added making a marginal value very much less so.
Station Casinos must be feeling the pinch as their other more upscale properties (Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock ) have also instituted tricky "fees" , reduced service and lower payouts.
We "Love Locals" too - we dont love being ripped off so this was definitely a first time last time stay.took the offer stayed there tues. HORRIBLE ! first the pool waitress decided to help her self with extra tip out of my change , whatever. next , apparently they are  in the public pool bizz now. allowing non guest to pay ten dollars and bring their section 8 brood of kids to pollute the scene. bad move ! next the buffet was UNEATABLE  worst buffet i've been to in ten yrz .  i mean it was terrible . low quality frozen microwaved crap , prison food .the final straw and capper was got up to take advantage of the breakfast specials 5.30 am and the coffee shop was closed . went to my room packed and took my bizz out of there . this is a nice looking joint but as true to stations reputation the place sucks. they don't love locals,  just their bottom line.  NEVER AGAIN !    they can keep their chezzy crappy offers and bait and switch operation . DO YOURSELF A FAVOR STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE !Let's see. My appt was at 8am,I was called back at 8:56am, and didn't see a doctor till 9:10a A 60$ copay for the visit and a prescription the same price.. I'm kinda a big deal and my time is valuable. Thanks for wasting it.Most services around town exhibit extremely good service.  However, I guess there's always one here and there that stands out negatively.  Here's my experience with one of those providers.  

On May 17th, 2014, I was extremely ill and went to a UMC Quick Care on Marks Street in Henderson.  I thought I had food poisoning because two days before during work hours I began vomiting and became weak almost immediately.  I went home and for the next 12 hours stayed nauseated and continued to vomit intermittently.  I wasn't sure what was wrong with me; I'm usually never sick. I couldn't keep food down and lost all body strength.  Because I just began a new job, I had no medical insurance so I went to UMC, paid a $50 initial fee to see a doctor.  The doctor ordered an x-ray to make sure I didn't have pneumonia, and thank God, that result was negative.  The doctor's diagnosis was acute bronchitis.  I thought for sure the doctor would give me a prescription for Azithromycin (Z-Pak) or some antibiotic, but she didn't.  Instead, she recommended Tylenol.  Returning to the clinic the following day to request an antibiotic, I was told to just allow the bronchitis to dissipate on its own over the next few weeks.  The doctor's rationale was that I could become immune to antibiotics.  I left the clinic as weak and nauseated as the day before.  And, because I had just started a new job, I HAD to return to work the following day feeling weak and physically off balance; worrying if I'll become even weaker and contract pneumonia.  Even today, a month later, I'm still not feeling completely well.  I don't feel like myself; I don't think it's out of my system yet.  

So what's UMC Quick Care's point?  Obviously, it's okay to bill me other charges (in addition to the $50 fee) to see a doctor only to be told to take a Tylenol?  When you go to UMC Quick Care, it's because you're feeling really sick; you anticipate seeing a doctor and obtaining medication to help you get well. 

Had I known this will probably cost me in excess of $200 only to be told to take a Tylenol, I could have saved the money, gone over to Walgreen's and have the pharmacist recommend Tylenol.  That certainly would have helped me to heal sooner, I'm sure.Not a fan. This was my first visit to this L&L, but my second overall in the valley. I'm just not a fan. We went on a Saturday morning for breakfast and as we were ordering, I'm not sure if the cashier was new, or just had no clue.  I asked for the sausage, eggs, and rice which is listed on the menu as a side dish, and she looked at me like I was speaking Swahili. Umm, right there, side dish, sausage. eggs. rice. pretty please?  Still had no clue...put something into the register. My bf then ordered spam musabi, and the spam, egg, and rice "side dish".  Again, confused look and we had to point at what we were talking about. She put that into the register. The total was $8.95 with two drinks.  When I looked at the receipt, I noticed only his dish was on there.  HELLLOOO SUNSHINE????   It's a simple task paying attention when people are ordering their food.  They fixed the issue, apologized profusely, and we had our food in about 5 minutes. The table we sat down at, I noticed was, as other posters described, grimy. Almost like the grease was never properly cleaned on the table and left a dried greasy residue. It was vile.  My forearm kept sticking...like it was rested on candle wax.  It was gross. Ok, this is kind of a quick serve outlet, and there are no white linens, I get that, but basic cleanliness is a must if I go back. I drive past this place daily, and sometimes I want something quick...i'll continue driving.I normally give everyone the benefit of the doubt, since we all have bad days.  I was politely asked if I needed help upon walking into the store, which I responded no.  As I was browsing around looking at wedding dresses and thin red headed woman who worked there stepped in front of my and grabbed the dress out of my hand that I was looking at to show two other girls. RUDE!  Ill never go back there again!My wife ordered an outfit and it needed alterations.  Dress arrived earlier than the alteration schedule and she picked up the dress and went back about 2 weeks later for alterations.  She went last night to pick up said dress and had numerious bad experiences.  the good news is after complaining to their customer service at their headquaters everything was resolved within 1 day.  If I did not take the additional stpes to complain this review would end up as horrible but alas their regional rep was understanding and showed concern.Wow, one of the worst experiences with customer service I have ever had that has officially turned me off this location and possibly the entire franchise. 

We were seated really quickly to a booth and then our waitress came over. I know it wasn't just me that felt this because my friend also felt the same way, but she totally came off like she didn't want to be there at all. I know most people don't want to be at their jobs but it isn't our fault as customers, and you need to earn your tips. She was just very off-putting. She tried to "sell" a lot of items to us literally right as we sat down but had no feeling behind them, just like she was being forced to talk up specials, etc. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a servers job to talk up their products, but have some tact. She was just listing things to buy and it became annoying quickly. She left for our drink orders and came back to give us our drinks and set up the olive oil and pepper for the bread that she hadn't brought out yet. She literally put 1/6 of a teaspoon on the plate with the pepper. Yes because I'm sure between two people we will only want a teeny tiny piece of bread and be done. 

Looking at the menu, it looks as if they have changed a lot - and not for the better. The prices have gone up and the options have gotten less and less. I got the sheet to do the make your own pasta and it looks as if they took away a lot of the options for mix-ins. After ordering our waitress tried to crack a joke/sell my friend salad by referring my meal as "rabbit food". Aaaaand Adina is pissed. 

Eventually she brings out the bread and a minute later brings out my "rabbit food", aka a caesar salad. Salad was fine, and actually a decent portion size. During this time their computers went down and our waitress asked my friend what she ordered again. It happens, but there was still something off-putting about how she asked. The entire meal just seemed to be... tense. 

We get our food, and wow. My portion size couldn't be smaller. I remember when I used to order MYO pasta where there was so much that I had to take 3/4 of it home. I ended up finishing all of it. It was good, but the toppings and add-ins were lacking and it was just a sad little bowl of pasta. Definitely not what I was expecting especially for $10. 

My friend and her daughter seemed to like their food, but it got to the point where I was at the end of my water. I sat it on the end of the table for almost 10 minutes before someone who WASN'T our waitress came by to refill it and also got us an extra order of bread. It is a very bad sign when you get all the way down to your water to the point of sipping annoyingly, and then still having to wait almost 10 minutes for a refill. It was still about 5 minutes after that when our waitress finally came over to ask how we were doing. She tried pushing dessert on us by just leaving a dessert card with us, but it wasn't even a push so much as, "Yeah he's the desserts, whatever." Her attitude really came across like she did not care whatsoever which is why my tip reflected that I also did not care whatsoever. 

When the girl who fills water who you see for 2 minutes is the best part of the customer service for your entire night, something is wrong. Worst service I have ever had, I couldn't even really enjoy my meal because all I wanted to do was to get out of there and away from our waitress. It's sad that this Macaroni Grill has gone so downhill. The prices have skyrocketed, and the portions have gotten smaller. I don't think I will be coming back to this location again.Ok...I know that it's a chain restaurant, however, there are great ones..this is not one of them.  This place is terrible.  My husband, father and I went there for dinner last night because we had shopping to do in the area.  It was so bland and overpriced. Our server must have been new, at least I hope she has some kind of  an excuse.  My father got his dinner first, then I got mine, then about 5-10 minutes later my husband got his.  Since we are not rude people, we wait until everyone has there food before we start to eat.  No apologies, no excuses, none what so ever for the timing. 
So, I usually like to make my comments short....don't go....terrible food, worse service,Before I begin this review, I will say that I've had a couple of other trips to this same Macaroni Grill location, and both of them have been satisfactory. However, this last trip I had was the absolute worst. The waitress was rude, and unhelpful as far as her knowledge about the wines were concerned. Our food took 45 minutes to and hour to arrive, and it when it did, it was so unappetizing. Not to mention the fact that I had ordered two glasses of wine and the waitress "forgot". All the pasta dishes at the table (there were five of us), were cold and had that hardened look to it that pasta has when it's left out too long.The only item that we ordered that came out decently, was the calamari. We did bring this to the attention of the manager, who was very nice and gave us 50% off of our whole meal. I was just extremely disappointed with the service, and don't plan to return to this location again.Horrible service! Waitress was Lorraine. She couldn't answer any questions bout the food. Didn't explain how the trio combo works. Never checked on me. They didn't pick up any of my dirty dishes til the end of my meal. Found a Nat in my salad and the mgr Jed had his nerve to argue that it wasn't a bug! I didn't ask him I was telling him. Never again will I spend another dollar there. It's not the only Italian place around. Mgr offered to comp my whole meal. I refused offer because I felt he was trying to win me over.. Didn't work, that's why I'm letting other people know... And it was 11am so it wasn't even busy so there was no excuse for the service!!!!!  McDonald gives you better service....Stay home, go to Chili's or go somewhere the service is good. I will NEVER go here again after waiting an HOUR for boneless wings and a salad. Are you kidding me??? lol  Just say no people!I bought a Living Social voucher for 3  $12 car washes for $18. I have had my car washed here before and they did a wonderful job of cleaning out the interior and exterior, taking a good 30-40 minutes on the car. I was expecting something similar as the car washes had cost about $12 before ($6 with the voucher). However, I was shocked this time that they just had me drive through the car wash myself. No vacuuming or cleaning the inside. They took off the antenna and threw it in the car and told me to drive forward. They forgot to tell me to put the car in neutral and the car bounced off the pushing lever. I had to put the antenna back on myself. The wash was done in 5 minutes. I talked to the manager that I wanted my money refunded for the remaining 2 car washes as I did not plan to come back. He said he had nothing to do with it. "Talk to Living Social". I told him I will write a review of my experience. he said "I don't care what you do".Avoid this place. They are just trying to hustle you for more services that you don't really need. 
You don't really need an engine flush unless you spilled contaminants in the engine. Every customer walking in, they are just trying to scam them. 
I really wish to save any more people from falling into their trap.I came here once to buy one of my eyeglasses and the service (like about 7 years ago) were very helpful.

However, I came back a couple of weeks ago to see if they can get one of my eyeglasses fixed and just wanted to ask a question. And they were completely rude and I didn't even get to finish my question and the person that helped me just said "No, we do not fix that!
I was surprised by this encounter and was kind of offended.  (maybe because i wasn't buying an eyeglass frame from them).  

The only Pro i would say is that they do have a great selection of high-end frames!
but Im pretty hesitant on going back there again even though they have a frame that I really liked.LOL.Service is very slow for only 6 people in the entire restaurant! It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.If I could give negative stars, I would. The first man I encountered was very helpful and got me to put a down payment on a mattress to save the sale price. I go in four days later to buy my mattress in full and the second salesman I encountered was rude, pushy, and overbearing. He didn't want to give me my initial receipt back (literally stopped me from grabbing it off of the table and acted very shady.). He talked down to me the entire time (probably because I am young and a woman) and was very aggressive. I still paid for my mattress but left VERY upset. I immediately went to another mattress store and got a much better deal down the road at mattress firm. I will never again go to best mattress. I am STILL waiting for my refund to be processed!! Waste of time and money at this place!Got violently sick 6 hrs after eating a beef taco with salsa fresca from this location last night. Im a nurse so I know how food poisoning works. I'll  never go here again. I'd give no stars if I could. I'm also not the first person to get food poisoning here... Read down the reviews. There have been others recently. 
TO THE MANAGER: food poisoning has nothing to do with how natural your food is... It have everything to do with temperature control, handling and employee hand washing . Please fix you problem before other ppl have to spend the day vomiting.Short story: Terrible service, metal filing in food.

I'm a big fan of Chipotle and eat there semi-regularly. I usually go to the one on Eastern in Henderson. This one on Sunset is closer to me so I went here for the first time.

The place is clean and sterile, like all Chipotles. The first server, who prepped a chicken burrito, acted like a robot, zero personality, and after scooping the meat immediately turned and walked away.

The second server ... nothing noteworthy, seemed nice.

The cashier, wow. No eye contact, rude demeanor, yanked credit card out of my hand, swiped it, handed it back with receipt and promptly turned away without saying a word throughout the entire transaction.

I will not be re-visiting this Chipotle location again.

And then when I get home, halfway through the burrito my mouth begins chewing on a half-inch black metal filing.It really hurts me to update and down grade my review, but today, was so unacceptable.

I walked into BRUS today, because my husband and I have decided that it is time for our 8 month old to sleep in her own room, (her crib). I got the "breathable" mesh bumpers at my baby shower, almost a year ago, and they haven't really worked out for two reasons.

1- My crib has a solid wood panel in the back, and 2- my daughter rams her head into her crib... like she's a little bull.. she likes to sleep in corners.

So, because she is older, and the SIDS risk isn't really a factor anymore, i wanted to look around to find some normal (padded) bumpers.

i believe the associate's name was Beth, and man, she was as mean as a snake.

She pretty much told me that  I would be putting my baby in danger if I put bumpers on her crib............. She "predicts" that some states won't even sell bumpers in the future. I should contact my doctor before I buy bumpers.... Because babies can get tangled up in the bumpers.....

Not really seeing how this is possible, when bumpers get tied to the crib?

Then, the funny part of it is, that she has a bumper that she can sell me for $20.


Seriously? What happened to the dangers?TO POTENTIAL STUDENTS:

DO NOT EVEN BOTHER LOOKING HERE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING BEAUTY SCHOOL!


Stuff the school does not mention to you at the time of enrollment:

- they PREFER you have at least SOME experience in what you are there to learn, in other words, newbies not apply

- Staff does not care who you are after you are enrolled, so do not expect any special treatment and/or caring staff members for any concerns you may have

- that kit that you pay for out of pocket, items will be used for practice and on customers if the school just simply cannot supply what is needed

- nail techs always run out of paper towels and acrylic, always

- its irritating and inconvenient to them if you have no one at home to practice on

- if its busy, you will run out of the proper equipment needed and be given a stool and a box to place your ass and supplies on while doing a pedicure

-while being taught how to do something, you will not be given any pointers on what you should work on to improve and the only response given to you by so called PROFESSIONAL and LICENSED cosmetologists / manicurists is pretty much, 'good enough.'

-unless you are enrolling with a friend, don't expect fellow students to try and help you out or BECOME your friend. SNOBBY SNOBBY SNOBBY!

-If you mess something up, or do not do it properly, both your fellow students AND staff, will make fun of you behind your back not bothering to give you pointers or any sort of helpful advice

- if you want someone to take any complaint you may have seriously, you have to threaten to drop out and get your money back. But even then, they go back to ignoring you as soon as they know you've given them a second chance

- Even if class picture day is 2 days after you enroll, You are expected to participate no matter how uncomfortable you are

- If the next competition is scheduled within the first week of you starting, you are expected to participate and be judged on your work. No matter how advanced or inexperienced you are. 

- Nail techs, cosmos and estheticians do not intermingle. They all talk poorly about each other.

- NO student actually LIKES attending here

- The only time you are noticed is when you don't show up for class, since that can be held against you

- Miss Tana is not a very well liked person, she has the mentality of a popular girl in high school and needs to knock it off with the 6 inch heels and low cut tops

- if you pay tuition in full you get less attention from the school. Only because they do not have to come after you at any point to get the rest of their money

-they do student appreciation day, and some foods served will be prepared in the sinks dirty foot water, acetone and other chemicals are poured into

- Miss idontknowhowtospellhername, the staff member you should be dealing with most, the staff member in charge of keeping you updated about your status, the staff member keeping track of your attendance and hours, is very unprofessional. Shes rude, often pisses students off, doesn't go out of her way to try and help you and VERY much should not be working with people

- you are expected to start working with the public after 100 hours (at least as a nail technician) no matter if you've practiced 1 mani / pedi or 5

- if you refuse to participate in required competions for any reason, you will be threatened suspension. Even if the reason is that you don't feel comfortable because you just started


I cannot stress to you how terrible this place was.
It was like being in high school again,
but everyone was over 18, some even over 50.

Staff often recommends to prospective students that the best way to get an idea of whether or not they should attend is to get a service done and talk to a current student about it. Don't bother. I can tell you right now that not one student was happy or excited to be there. If any of the students said otherwise, Its because an instructor or staff member was nearby.

The quality of work done by students was pathetic. For practicing state board so often, I was expecting some impressive work by at least SOME students. The only student I would have let do any practice on me was self taught for years and was only attending school to be licensed. Marinello was not responsible for teaching her any skills she had.

I think as a cosmetology school, they should ALWAYS be supplied with needed materials, especially since they are used on a daily basis. Constantly being out of Mortimer, Acrylic, Paper towels, pedicure chairs, and acetone is ridiculous. Its even MORE ridiculous that they expect you to use supplies in your kit which YOU pay for out of pocket.

On top of that, the Orkin man that sprays both at the school and at my work asked me why I wasn't attending, I told him I didn't like the program and the school itself was nasty and he replied 'well I could of told you that.'

Even the guy who sprays for bugs thinks this schools gross?
eww.This company treats their employees horrible and for that fact I will never give them my business again. 
If people wonder why the employees look or act so miserable its because they are grossly underpaid and are shown very little respect.

They are the Wal-Mart of liquor stores, enough said!Don't buy any type of ring from this place.  My wife and I were going to renew our vows on Hawaii.  I picked out a really nice 4 carat ring for the wedding.  Or so I thought.  The ring was blessed by the pastor and 3 days later on the plane back one of the smaller diamonds on the ring fell out.  They gave us the exact same ring 2 weeks later.  Today I get a call from my wife telling me a stone fell out of the new ring we got.  We had just gotten this new ring blessed by taking a side trip to Kauai to have it done.  Now I'm out an additional $400.00+ and my wife has a crappy ring to wear.

Go to a jeweler and don't get what you think is a good quality ring from a department store.Today September/24th  around 12:30 pm, my friend and I visited JCP at the Galleria mall, we decided to go to The Sephora kiosk to see what's new, what new products are out, and maybe buy a nail polish that I was interested in, and just look around.

We were well dressed ladies in our late 30's, we went to the eyeshadow counter and were testing out the new shadows, suddenly a sales woman probably in her 60's with short blond hair appeared, and starts to rudely tell us to use a sponge instead of our fingers, we said fine, we've never been "repremended" by a sales person before, then I made a mistake to ask her that I never picked up my birthday present that Sephora members get, she didn't even ask me when my birthday was, she rudely told me she had nothing to offer me in her store, I said oh ok, just very rude woman.

Then we went over to the nail polish counter, which was what we wanted to buy, we started testing some polish, she kept following us, and "cleaning up" after us, we were very careful to only use the samples, and putting them back in their proper slots, but she wasn't having it, she kept following us the entire time, at the same time making comments to the other sales woman, telling her that there were some sample polishes missing and if she saw who took them, she just made us very uncomfortable!!!

We finally were so turned off by the whole experience, we just left.

I love Sephora, I have shopped both at the Desert Passage, and the Venetian Sephoras, and online. The Sephora philosophy is to come in, be comfortable, test out products, without being followed and being felt like criminals. This woman acted like we were going to pull a fast one on her.

The whole time we were there, she was not welcoming, was rude, curt, never once smiled, and never asked us if we needed help, she should either be retrained on how you treat customers, or just work somewhere where she did not have to deal with people.I have gotten a manicure here twice and each time the nails weren't fully painted and the women doing them always gets fingerprints in the paint.Awful. Frozen over cooked chicken with a grey-colored covering (think it was supposed ti be cheese). Seriously you can find better Chicken Parm at Sara Lee.

The red sauce was straight out of a can. 

The pasta is not fresh made and I doubt any consideration is given to quality of food.

Really really disgusting!  Not sure how they stay in business. This is not the kind of food that I go out to eat.First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. 

We came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered 
1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers
me i ordered:
2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers

well first she came back .. do you want cheese? 
yes.. i circled cheddar.. ok
then she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?
well.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?
her: we have xyz and soudough
me: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)

we finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. 
Neither had tomato or green peppers... 
my bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?
the BF: he said well can you fix it? 
she started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... 
finally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? 
HER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.


I walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? 
The fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)I want to share the real deal about this salon, I am not discouraging any one,  you should try it and see how you like the work and treatment. I have been going to NAIL SPA for many, many, many years before KC became the new owner and her Brother owned it at the time. I was actually very happy with KC who always took care of me for a very long time, years and years. Her work was always good and always loved the treatment. I would usually spend a good amnt of $$$$ there and always sent her business. What changed, well to this day I am not so sure, but she started moving me to other techs which was fine they did good work, but my appointments were always booked with her... if by accident I messed up a nail and would ask her to fix it she would get mad, very bothered and would get short with me. I understand she has a business to run and has other clients to focus on, but honestly her attitude started bothering me. One time I got 3d nail work done when she started working with it, well pretty much all of them fell off and when I came back to show her she again got upset, scoffed and said "just sit down, I am busy right now." Another time I brought a polish from home granted it was a new polish, when they applied the top coat to it the polish kept bubbuling up, the tech would show her and they kept trying to fix it and fix it... to the point that I lost count as to how many coats of polish and top coats I had on all nails. I told her that it really was not working out if I could change the polish or if they were to busy (which it was'nt) that I could come in the next day. She scoffed and said, well you brought this polish and you go home and you will like it in a few hours. Sure enough  my hubby said you don't look happy with it... it honestly does not look good. I went to her the next day and asked if they could please change the polish, she scoffed and said well some one else will help you I have an appointment comin in. I waited and waited and her appointment never showed, after 30 min she came up to me and said just sit down and fine I will take care of it. I told her I would pay since it seemed to bother her so much, she no dont worry about it just sit down. It was really uncomfortable. I finally put thought into it and called her one day to schedule another appointment, she said I dont have time for you, you have to go to another tech I said that was fine then she started getting a bit rude (I know you may think may be its me, she was on speaker in the car and my hubby looked at me and mouthed go some where else) I asked KC at that time that I had been feeling uncomfortable, was there an issue or does she may be not want my business? She said no thats not it, do you want an appointment or not? I told her no, and thank you for her time and that I would no longer be returning as her client. 

Severing this business relationship with her was the best thing that I could decide on after I would always spend $130 to $150 dollars each visit, and always felt guilty of spending that amount on a shop that honestly did not care for me or my business. I could only take it personal, because I would see her treat other clients with a bubbly and happy persona, and she woulde be the complete oposite with me. Honestly the work is between ok, not great and she has some new remodeling in the salon which helps, but her attitude and treatment stinks and I would honestly say don't bother.As I was just looking for a new nail salon I noticed this whack ass place deleted my review along with the others that gave low ratings...so keep deleting my shit...I'm gonna keep posting it :) jackass'!We had ordered a delivery to our hotel the first night with no problems. The next night, however, was a different story. The girl on the phone had an unbelievably condescending, rude, nasty attitude. So rude, in fact, that I said "nevermind" and hung up. Never been tretaed this way. I don't ever write reviews, but there's a first time for everything :(This is the second time I have ordered delivery from this place. The first time the pizza was horrible, but I gave them a pass because we ordered Chicago style, and that doesn't always work for delivery.  We ordered a sausage, green pepper and mushroom pizza tonight, and when it was delivered it was not cooked through. After reheating in our oven for 20 minutes, it still wasn't cooked.  I called napolis to let them know, only to be told they would put a note in my account for next time, that I would prefer it to be cooked through.  No thank you, I will not be ordering from you again.My husband and I went here for lunch during the week and it was terrible. The portions are small, the service is well below average and the food was not good. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich , and it was extremely dry. The burger was ok, but the fries were burned and salty.  Never Again!Roach on the windowsill. 'Nuff said.2 pm on a Thursday, no customers other than myself , and 3 employees standing at the cash register. No hello, no offer to help, just lots of personal socializing and all 3 looked me up and down while mumbling to themselves. Wow really..Hi haters! I'll never be back to this store again.I have to agree with Carly G.   As if the food isn't bad enough, the service is even worse.  I had to meet a few friends here so I decided to stay but regretted it.  We all did.  Pizza is awful, spaghetti is right out of a can, or it tasted like it.   Skip this one.  There are great Italian restaurants with far better food and service.Service is so slow it's ridiculous....they need more servers on football weekends especially.  Most of the time the servers are servicing the casino portion also.
The food is so, so.....won't be back for awhile if at all.Its Wal-MartWhat a horrible experience with the Wal-Mart auto center. After 2.5 hours of waiting and taking half a day off from studying, I went back to the store only to learn that absolutely nothing was done for my car as they did not have an oil filter to change my oil. I was then met with rudeness when I complained to the staff about the situation. Needless to say, I will never be coming back here for anything, including something as simple as an oil change.Overall - Poor service, poor attitude, poor follow up, but... good selection,knowledgeable sales staff and good prices.

1.  Experience -Been to this place for a long time and have spent each year at least 1000-1500.

2.  Selection - I am hard on clothes and travel alot. The quality of their products I am very happy with. You have to spend a bit to get quality stuff.

3.  Quality - Their own brand, Pronto Uomo, is very good overall and will wear well and look great. You cannot go wrong here.

4.  Tailoring - They will tailor and alter everything to fit you perfectly, and once you tailor something, you can have it altered in future for free.

5.  Service - Their current staff is not up to task unfortunately. I have gone there three times to order the same shoes I purchased there before. They did not have it in stock, so they called to another store and had it sent to their store. They would put me on a list to call and then never call me. I would call in and they do not call back. I waited 4 weeks and finally ordered it on-line from Amazon and got it in 3 days. They lost my sale. I wanted to buy from Men's Wearhouse, but they didn't care.

6.  Tux Rental - I am afraid that you will have no choice but to use them as they are the largest and most recognized in town. However they suffer from not being organized, not having a good process for customer service and not helping the long lines properly. They have a numbering and sign in sheet, and only half of the staff will work it, while the others just help whomever shows up. Iris the manager will bypass it and then when you complain, she ignores you. You will see 10 people waiting to get fitted for tuxedos, and 7 staff, with only 3 of them working the tux people. Yet all 7 at one time you will see help others with tux fittings, so it is odd to see more than 50% of the staff standing around at the front desk jabbering while the client line is not worked....

7.  I got frustrated there and mentioned my concerned which led to the staff person helping me there simply going on break immediately without advising me, the manager ignoring me, and one kind staff helping me.

I do not enjoy spending thousands at a store yearly and then they treat me like this, so I will not be back, but for all of you, the quality of selection, and the knowledge of the staff has been good up till 2010, so maybe they just do not like me. I would suggest you still try this place and buy stuff, but I will not any longer as it is too painful.Terrible customer service....Also try renting a 59.00 Tux!  There is no such thing.  Its dishonest advertising practices.  Also my husband brought my son in for the 2 for 1 suit sale...the salesman matched up his suits with shirts that were 90.00 each!  did not think twice about mentioning that to my husband.  Also the belts were exactly the same but one was 20.00 more! (different color)  If you shop there always look at the prices and look at your receipt!!!!!!  They must work on commision.  Up selling must be their thing...WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK,The worst service experience I have had in years tonight.  No refills and finally had to go and ask for my check.0 stars if I could, sheenas did my boy dirty and nicked his head out of control, look at the photos to confirm. This place should shut its doors after how low they did my boy.I made a 10 am appointment 2 weeks in advance for my 20,000 mile service. They said it would take 2 - 2.5 hours (for an oil change, tire rotation, replace filter). I had a friend pick me up so we could waste time. She drops me off 3 hours later and they tell me they haven't even started on my car! I think is absolutely completely disrespectful that they couldn't even call me and tell me that they got behind. I then had to get a ride to my house where I had to wait for a shuttle to come and get me later to come back to get my car, throwing off my afternoon plans. What is the point of making an appointment if they don't even try to adhere to it? I will not be returning to this location to service my vehicle.Horrible, dishonest salespeople -- including John Barr himself. He and other guys there lied to me, tried a bait and switch with the contract, stalled things trying to wear me out. After four hours, and about to close the deal, I noticed a new $250 fee that was not there before and we had already agreed what the fees would be. When I brought it up, they basically said pay it or else, so I walked out. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH JOHN BARR OR ANY FINDLAY DEALERSHIP. I also suspect most of the high ratings on here are shills.Went again for a routine oil change - made an appointment.  When I went in for service I had to wait 10 minutes before anyone even looked at me.  Finally sat down to fill out the service order. I cannot understand why they do this by hand each time.  I bought the truck here, why don't you have my information in the computer?  After filling it all out the service rep says 

"it will be ready in about 2 and 1/2 hours"

"I had an appointment" I replied.  

He shrugged his shoulders so I left.  Every time I have been to this place for service there has been a gaff.One slow morning at Honeybaked Ham Henderson, I went in for a ham sandwich to go. They reached into their refrigerator and grabbed a premade sandwich on a roll that was wrapped in cellophane and bagged it. I got home and it had a rotten tomato.

At the time I could not find a place to post a review, so I called Honeybaked' home office to find where to review. They apologized and said they would like to send me a coupon for a free sandwich. It did not come in 2 months. I called them back and they said it takes more time. It's been a year.

This branch and corporate office get 2 thumbs down. Will never visit this franchisee again!

Franchisee is supposed to custom make every sandwich fresh!This was my second visit to this store in the last 10 years. The furniture is actually not bad, but the sales people drive me insane. I will never buy anything in this store. Well, actually I'll never go there again. My first visit involved me walking around looking while a sales person slowly lagged behind me. I'd run to one side of the store and think that I was rid of her, and turn my head and there she was. The exact same thing happened today. My partner and I started playing cat and mouse and she fell for it. It was really quite comical. We ended up running out of the store to see if she would beat us to the front. We won, but barely. After announcing when I first walked in that I was just there looking and did not need assistance, that should have been enough of a message for them to LEAVE US ALONE! Well it wasn't, but it was enough for me to get the message to LEAVE THEM ALONE!I'd give a 0 if I could. The staff is very friendly, but the food is HORRIBLE! My husband and I got food poisoning from some lengua tacos and Carne asada fries. I guess I should've seen it coming when the cashier/cook said he was having trouble finding the lengua. (cow tongue. Hey, don't knock it till you try it... Somewhere else, of course.)I was a faithful client of Charmaine and Stacey for 7 years.
Never had an issue. UNTIL both were away on vacation.
I allowed the Manager "Valerie" to color my hair.
When my hair was every color of the rainbow, popsicle orange at the top, and green at the bottom, she offered to fix it in 11 days, since she was going on vacation. 
I pleaded with her that I couldnt possibly leave the salon looking like a trainwreck, she made an appt for 11 days later. I wore a hat for 2 days, after peoples disbelief, I complained on the REGIS website. Corporate then had Stacey try to correct it, IT WAS BAD, we couldnt colro correct it on the 1st try so we had an appt for a week and a half later, as she loaded me up with product to condition me.
Valerie came back and saw that Stacey had an appt to fix my hair again, and Valerie forbid all the stylists in the salon to never do my hair again.
I was shocked. I tipped her, Stacey and wasnt given any reason why.
I complained to Corporate once again, and tld them that I was banned from the salon, and the Gen Mgr was shocked as well. Corporate was great, they refunded my money, and said Im allowed back in and that she had no power to say that to anyone...but I wont be returning. She over charged me, was irresponsible, and then when her ego was bruised in front of her stylists she blamed the customer.
Valerie is not a good hair stylist. It took 4 stylists in awe, disbelief and disgust to stand over me and try to figure out a way to correct me.
I recommend going to anyone BUT Valerie. Shes a very bitter,and angry old lady with no respect for a client who had been utilizing the salon for yearsWorst experience ever! I went to this nail salon because my normal nail salon was closed and I wanted to get a cute full set done before my family came to town. I went in and waited because they were behind which wasn't a big deal. But when i finally sat down to do my nails it was a disaster! I have two request make them sort of thin and short because of my work the nails can not be really long. The whole time she did my nails she kept com planing how i wanted them short then when she was finished she only put one application top coat which resulted in my nails being not shiny and looked half finished then she went on and left me in chair to clean. I even had to go back the other day because i paid for my nails to be done and they were not luckily another technician put three more tops coats and my nails were nice and shiny. Good i thought! Until 2 days later my nails started cracking and lifting. I couldn't believe it! This was a total waste of money and i decided to rip my nails off after only having them for a week total! I will never waste my money here again nor will I return i rather drive the 45 mins  or wait next time till my normal salon is open.This is not the same great place it use to be. Very little attention is given to keeping the pasta / potato bar tidy, clean & warm. Wild kids were fingering up the choc sprinkles at the sundae bar. Hand sanitizer is broken & place was dirty. If seating are is dirty what does the back look like. So sad, this was once a great place to dine.I went here because of a massive craving for shellfish and it is not far from my house. I was sadly disappointed in almost every component of this experience.

Service: Honestly some of the worst service I've ever had. After ordering a cocktail, I was very disappointed when after 20 minutes my server returned to my table, noticed I didn't have my drink yet and said "No one brought your drink?" It is a huge pet peeve when servers do not take responsibility for their tables and it seemed this is what he was doing. My drink ended up coming, but a few minutes after my food. Two other factors played into this horrible service experience. My table was about three tables away from the computer the servers used to ring up orders, and I heard one of the servers very loudly talk about how he was "screwed out of a tip" by a table. Very unprofessional. Finally, the manager of the restaurant did not really seem to care about his restaurant. He stood near the bar socializing with a young woman the entire time I was there, not once did he leave to check on tables or do any work. The only reason I even knew he was the manager was because the servers kept coming up to him with questions.

Food: My food was served cold. Despite being in a steam pot...and it was all incredibly over-cooked. It was like they had steamed my shellfish and then let it sit in the steamer for hours before it was given to me. Very disappointed.I usually go to TGIF but after this experience and the previous ones NEVER again!

Im susbscribed to the rewards system and i usually get free appetizers or deserts for my points plus i get the 20% off or buy one get the other free in the mail. When i began coming here the waiters were really cool and they would accept both my coupons because they are not the same but lately, they've been jerks! They say the cannot accept both but they can its been done before in other TGIF restaurants as well. 

Like one of the waiters said "I dont see why not its not like you are giving me 2 of the same coupons"

Service has been horrible!!!Plain and simple don't stay here... Spent one night and it was one night to many... Only stayed because of groupon and will never trust either again! Horrible rooms... Lots of broken parts(shower, lights, end table)... Even the sheets where dirty... Pay the money and stay any where but here!This hotel gets 1 star because it's not possible to give no stars or negative stars.  Dirty everything.  Booked 2 nights but checked out after 1.  Would have checked out immediately upon seeing the room but it was after 9 pm.The chicken tenders had a weird rubbery texture and this was the second time so no more for me.Just say no. Save yourself some time. I've used them before, but just because they were more affordable. I honestly can't stand walking in the front door of an empty office, to be ignored by the staff. If it were the first time, I might let it go. But it happened the last time as well, and by another unfriendly employee. And it wasn't like they didn't hear me, I had a crying puppy and two loud children. Also would like to note, that the person behind the counter was NOT on the phone, or even helping another customer. She was just working on her computer. The lack of customer service is HUGE when it comes to caring for your pets. I mean, if they can't even be nice to the patrons, how can they be nice to your animal? Their low fees cannot make up for horrible, slow, inept service. It's unacceptable on so many levels. I will not be going back. And you should think twice before you go there.LOVE YOUR PET? THEN GO ELSE WHERE!
If your going here for their low rates then I suggest only getting vaccines (dirt cheap) on weekends, how ever if in any case you need someone to care for your animal, then you got the wrong place. my poor dog was sick with diarrhea, I took him in for his shots and explained that he was sick, they said that ad long as he is eating and drinking he'll be fine, well guess what he wasn't. I had to bring him in again for blood work I was never explained what was wrong with him instead they said Dr. Stefano says "bring him back in for more blood work" (I guess one test isn't enough or they needed to charge me again,  AWESOME). I declined, and sought a second opinion I went to Pebble and Maryland animal hospital, and when I requested the records to be faxed over they gave me attitude (how audacious), they faxed over only shot records and when I called them again they said  "we will no longer fax anything" and hung up on me! WOW,  how Unprofessional this is how they treat patrons, just imagine your animal in their care? You're better off leaving them with dr. Kavorkhian at least he would sympathize.  Take my word, experience and frustration and heed my warning.Horrible service they will come to your house start job and never come back to . They do Kohler repairs and Kohler should lose their number!Not even going to explain how I ended up here, so let's just skip forward a bit and wrap this up quickly...

I've been to nicer joints in TJ, and if my brother wasn't 6'5" and 280lbs, I don't know that I wouldn't have gotten mugged in the back alley.

I think they should reconsider naming this place Chicas Gorditas.  It was not pretty.  Thank goodness for mas Tecates!  Even though the bartender forgot to change my $20 when we ordered 2 beers.  I didn't feel it would have been beneficial to our well being to pursue the matter though.  I'm a good tipper!  

Chalking this one up to life experience...Order 2 large Chilis
2 spicy Chicken Nuggets
2 large Drinks (Fruit Punch and Diet Coke)

Simple order you would think...........NOT

2 large chilis were filled only half full
No spoons to eat it with
Does Diet Coke sound like Regular Root Beer?

I will keep writing reviews on this place until they change their ways. Give someone else a job if you don't want to work there.The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together.This review is for Craps only.  I arrived here last Friday night around 6 P.M. and the craps table was empty.  Here I was thinking WTF is going on?  How can one of the more profitable table games be empty on such a busy night?  I jump on the table and make a few bets and start me roll.  I dabble in controlled shooting, but most casinos don't really care if players set the dice.  NOT HERE!  After my first set of rolls (pit boss is watching the whole time) I hit my point and they switch stick-men.  The new stick-man stares at the pitboss, and as I'm starting my roll puts his stick out over the rail and in front of my shot... My dice hit his stick and I seven out.  I then politely ask if he can move his arm back just a little bit, as I'm not able to shoot around him.  He yells at me, saying that he needs to put his stick out to protect himself from the players and I can either step back, or leave the table....  I took my chips off the table and cashed out.  No wonder no one plays craps here.  If your looking for a good time, go somewhere else.Watch out for the crack windshield guys, after you make a claim to your insurance your rates will go up for filing a claim.They do an ok job on the wash. Interior not all that great. BEWARE of the BS FREE WINDSHIELD CRACK REPAIR scam. They'll say something like it's free repair, all we have to do is call your insurance company to verify your coverage. What you find out later on is that it is an actual insurance claim and your rates WILL GO UP! It almost happened to me, fortunately if was able to take care of it before the damage was doneDon't order the Artichoke Chicken Flatbread, Total Flop. First of all its not flatbread. It's made with a tortialla. It's basically an open Quesadilla. When I asked the waiter about it  he has no idea about what he was serving.This review applies only to this location as it is the only location I have been. Okay so I've been here three times, every time I have been disappointed. The first and second time the food was mediocre and overall very greasy! And not good greasy lol the kind if greasy you want to soak up with a napkin lol.  The third time was a joke! My friends, my fiancé and I went, I ordered a steak well done, emphasizing the "well" because rare makes me gag a little lol anyway we got our food about an hour later, my steak was beyond rare, but I tried to work with it since it was a busy night, I cut the edges off but in the end it was practically still alive so I sent it back.(while waiting for the waiter to take it I had cut the rare steak into about 4 pieces.) about 40 mins later- my friends had all finished their meal, I still had nothing to eat except the measly 4 shrimp they put on my plate and the waiter came back with the 4 cut up pieces I sent back except they were on a dessert plate and charcoal black! My friends and I all stared at the plate for a minute before we figured out that it was the steak I had sent back, I told him to take it off the check which he seemed upset about but did. I haven't been back since and I won't go back again lol.10-25-2013 Monday 6 PM party of four. We were seated and immediately were approached by a very rude server female. I was clear she didn't want to be there let alone serve us. This was really a shame as the other couple (visitors from Australia) had never been in an Outback but come to the states every year. We ordered drinks, which came one at a time. I asked the server what was the problem, she said bartender had to restock entire bar. Wife ordered salad, no croutons server was snippy. Order steak and lobster steak cook wrong lobster was size of shrimp over cooked. Server was no help what so ever. 
Bad experience .01 TIP rendered.

This outback has been steadily going down hill for Two years.Starts as good still serving breakfast I'm happy ok. Then the McCafe machine is broke ok screw it I'll just by Starbucks. Next order taken employees shift change and forget to make my food. All I can say is are you kidding meIm so Damn Mad right now I cant see straight I ordered lunch for my boss and I to be delivered and I got the fuckin short end of the stick! I had the BLT sandwich and it came with extra burnt bacon and rancid mayo. I called back and asked them to replace my meal with fresh Items the owner who happens to be the cook in her russian voice said no im not replacing anything...Really you dont know who you fucking. If you like eating here you wont for long. because im going to see to it that this place get every demerit thats coming to them.Crappy service.YOUR PRICES ARE RIDICULOUS! I have to say that I have compared the prices at Office Max to Walmart and a few others and the difference is phenomenal. I even went when they were having their close out sale I believe it was the store on Craig and one thing I can say is I bought a few of the store fixtures for a really good price but even with the close out prices the box of paper was almost half the price at costco. I rarely shop at Office Max for this reason. If the prices were more competitive they would get more business.I too have had to wait over n hour almost each time I went there and after my last experience of being extremely misdiagnose we will now be going elsewhere. Would never recommend.Expensive, understaffed, messy..... horrible customer service. Terrible return policy...What a Dump compared to Walmart and Target. Their aisles and merchandise are unorganized and sloppy. I don't know how they stay in business.I am rarely ever in this area so I don't frequent this movie theater very much. The last two times I was here, I was not a fan at all. The seats are very uncomfortable. Both times.... (that's right, both times) I was the unlucky one and had a broken chair. It was so hard to recline back. It was nearly impossible to cuddle with my date because my chair was not willing to recline back. Super annoying.I had a 10am appointment and arrived at 9:45. Apparently according to this office, it takes 30 minutes to fill out the new patient information. So I sign in, wait 5 minutes and a Filipino woman with glasses at the front desk scolds me like a child because I didn't show up 30 minutes early. 
 I would've been fine with getting bumped because I didn't show up when they wanted me to, even though it's unreasonably early. I would've been fine with waiting, but I'm not fine with some front desk person speaking down to me. I'm a customer, plain and simple. You offer a service, and I'm coming to you and paying to receive that service. Doctors offices are no different. I handed back my paperwork and left. If the doctor isn't forward thinking enough to hire a competent front desk staff, then that gives reason to doubt competency with regards to anything, including medical advice.Don't go! Left with a bloody ear and cut on the other side of my head. Ive gone 2 times and both times was told they were too busy to add me to their system and it would be 45 mins.  Both times only one other peron there, too lazy and not the brightest group working there.NEVER EVER in my life coming here again. They charged me way too much money for a shitty job that my 5 year old niece could've done. The lady rushed doing my nails, my French manicure came out crooked and uneven, I'm extremely disappointed with the service. Never have I wasted my time and money in such a horrible way. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!If I can give this place negative stars I would. I selected this location as my primary care provider because it was close to home. I have visited this Dr office 3 times and 2 of my 3 visits resulted in extremely long waits and no consideration for other patients time what so ever. Let me just say that my visit today was just to get some blood results in which I already knew what the results were so I only anticipated my visit to take 5 mins. I also want to say the Dr I was assigned to was Dr. DeBellis. On my first visit I felt that the lady who checked me in treated me as if I was impeding on her time. But after completing the necessary paperwork and a couple returns to her desk she warmed up to me. The 2nd visit I waited 45 minutes to be seen by the Dr and by this time the front counter clerk noticed I had been waiting extremely long. My 3rd and last visit (today 08/27) my appt was scheduled for 11:15. I arrived 10 minutes early for my appt and upon checking in the front counter lady advised me that the Dr was running 20 min behind and said that I shouldnt be waiting as long as last time. I figured ok I can handle that. Well I had kept myself occupied on my phone for an hour and noticing there was me and 2 other people in the lobby before realizing I had waited that long. So I asked another office asst what the delay was and that I had been waiting for nearly an hour. All she could tell me was I was next. 15 mins later (now waiting an hour 15 mins) I approached the counter again demanding an explanation why the Dr was taking so long. All she could tell me was that the Dr had 3 other patients waiting and that I was next. At this point I was losing my patience and asked if there was a nurse, nurse practitioner, or office manager I could speak to or if another Dr could give me my results. Needless to say no one was available. It was then suggested to me that I reschedule my appt and then I was told my appt was scheduled at a bad time. (Wtf?!? And mind you I waited 5 weeks for my appt). I finally am told that the dr would see me in his office. So waiting yet again by this point it is now going on an hour and a half the dr finally comes in all upset with me and said that he has emergencies! I told him if these people have emergencies than they should have gone to an emergency room and that I had been waiting for an hour and a half for an appt I had sheduled at 11:15 in which  I arrived early for. Then he asked me if I had lab results and I told him thats what I was there for. Then he yelled back at me that he didnt deserve this abuse! He read my results off a printed report and I told him I wanted to talk to the office manager so that they can better manage his time. I asked the dr why another dr couldnt have just read my results. So long story short I apologized if I seemed to be abusive toward him but it was unacceptable that I have to wait an hour and a half for a five minute visit.  His answer was something along the lines that he didnt make the rules. (wth? Someone couldnt read a piece of paper to me?) lastly I waited another 5 mins and talked to the lady who checked me in and the last thing she told me was that Dr. DeBellis always runs late and that I could change drs who runs pretty on time. Sorry this a long rating but seriously? As soon as I walked out I called my insurance and changed my primary car provider to a different office altogether. 

First of all I dont care what kind of insurance I have drs get their payment either way and I could have saved my silly $5 copay for them to either call me with the results or pay the f'n 49cents postage to mail me my results! Second of all Dr. DeBellis ALWAYS runs late?!? I dont care how much of an amazing dr you are, learn some time management!!! Doctors should appreciate that there are people like me who have taken the time and effort to educate myself and lead an active healthy lifestyle to keep myself healthy so they can attend to the more serious conditions that others suffer! Plus the insurance companies should be paying me since I am the minority who keeps the premiums low and allow them to cover those with more catastrophic illnesses!!As is the norm with the Buffalo Wild Wings chain, the food was great. That said, the customer service at this particular location was absolutely ATROCIOUS,  and the reasoning behind this poor review. We arrived two hours early for a fight night event, and were informed that if we sat in the main dining hall there was a possibility of having strangers seated at the table with us because they were seating to capacity. We were given the option of sitting at the bar, and told that at the bar it would be first come first serve, and we wouldn't have to worry about sitting with anyone who was not in our party. We opted to do that instead. We were there early, very few people in the bar, so we asked our server if it would be possible to push two tables together to accommodate the amount of food we plan to buy and the two extra people that would be meeting us there. We were told that that would be fine, and the server actually helped to push the tables together for us. We changed out our hard wooden chairs for more comfortable chairs, again with the permission of the person operating the bar, ordered the first of our food, & Sat comfortably for the first hour and a half that we were there. After that change of shift occurred, and all of a sudden we couldn't have the chairs that we were using because they were saved for those who were gambling at the bar, and the two tables that currently held all of our food where suddenly not supposed to be together and we were forced to separate them. We asked to speak with a manager, who apologized for the inconvenience, acknowledged that her team should have been on the same page, and offered a meeting at another table that was larger and would accommodate our party, but  gave us a poor view of the monitor that we sat there for in the first place. I have never been to a place where the management's had so little control of their employees, and we're still unwilling to accommodate us in light of their poor communication with the team. On top of everything else, we got our food and were never brought silverware. Thank god for finger foods. We will NEVER be dining at this restaurant again. Very poor service.So I have ordered from China A Go Go for about 5 years now and have never had an issue. Today I called and as usual when calling from work I had 2 orders as we are paying seperatly, the girl on the phone told me that it would be 2 delivery fees, when I asked why she put someone else on the phone and they told me they now charge for each seperate order. When I told them to cancel the order she seemed like she did not care about loosing a customer  who was canceling a $25 order before taxes all because they wanted to charge an extra $2 . I will do a review on China Tango once im done eating lol, and China Tango only charges $2 for a delivery fee and the rate did not go up for seperate orders.Do not ask Tim for a Faux Hawk .... worst haircut ever! I went to another barber shop to get it fixed. Tim needs to learn how to do certain cuts not just want to get customers in and out! After my comment Tim is sending messages in the form of compliments saying im a Korean like his co-workers and that im together with someone named Kevin P.  You have a lot of class Tim.I'm a big fan of fatburger and have been to 3 locations in Vegas and Henderson. Today was our first time at Green Valley Ranch location thanks to Groupon. What a let down this place is! The meat was completely dry, although still slightly pink inside, and very bland. If you've been to Fatburger before you know how juicy there burgers are! Not here.... and just to top it off the soda machine only dispensed flat soda.... Don't bother coming here, even with a Groupon.We purchased the $8 for $16 coupon & leaving the top half with code intact my wife cut off the very bottom thinking it unnecessary. Without any show concern they refused taking the voucher. The clerk asked manager & he confirmed this decision. The code would tell them everything needed knowing but even after ordering this technicality resulted in her denial & embarrassment. It's sometimes degrading enough using coupons without people using flimsy reasons for denial of their validity. Wouldn't Fatburger love seeing people walk away with nothing after investing this money in their product. I would never again patronize Fatburger at Green Valley Ranch. Reading other reviews I see many reviewers concur with my experience. There are much better hamburgers in the Las Vegas valley.This place is tremendously bad.  It's the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  No question.  My wife ordered a carnitas burrito.  The pork was awful.  It was overcooked, spongy and slightly green.  Yuck!!  I ordered the beef burrito and cheese enchilada.  The beef was undercooked and tasteless.  The rice was terrible.  The cheese enchilada was bland, and the red sauce tasted like wallpaper paste.  Bland as heck and too thick.  The beans were decent, but not enough to get two stars even.  Many better places in Vegas to eat Mexican food.  Avoid this place at all costs.  I don't get the positive reviews.  It's just terrible.  Never again.I completely hate this place. Being that the Anthem community is so removed from Eastern, it appears that this Vons is very aware of the slight monopoly they have based on their close location.  Every time I go in here I pay way more than I would have paid at Smiths (even with my Vons loyalty card) and on top of that I can NEVER find at least half the things I need. Naturally, I save all my Vons trips for "emergency" cooking situations where I don't have the time to make it down to Smiths and back. Even then I would rather go to CVS than Vons because 1. Vons is expensive, 2. I can never find the stuff I need, and 3. If I do find it, it's located clear over on the opposite end of the store. 

For those interested, this Vons does have a Kosher foods section. However, I couldn't care less because I'm not Jewish and I don't see why the Kosher section is located front and center when you walk in. Seriously, it would be way more convenient as a bread, cheese, milk, eggs, pasta or canned foods aisle. You know, the kinds of foods that most everyone uses most often and might need to walk in and grab in a hurry.My normal stylist was out for this week.  Wanted to get a haircut for dinner with the wife tonight.  Decided to try out this Fantastic Sam.

Oh sh*T, big big  big big mistake.

I got assigned a stylist named Autumn.  She was the size of a hippo.  Waltzed up the chair, ask me what I wanted to be done, but never truly listened.  She gave me a brainless stare.  Yes, you could see it go into one ear and out the other.   Moron!!

Several things that I hated and is a no no:
1.  While cutting your hair, she was slapping my head left and right.  I felt like a cube ball.  It wasn't like a soft nudge, but a harsh push.
2.  Using the comb, she slides it down your ear.  It felt like the comb was slicing between my head and ear lob.  It hurt!  Where did she get her training!!!
3.  As she was cutting my hair, she was coughing and sneezing.  Ever so often, she wiped her nose with her right arm.  My god, this is incredibly gross and unsanitary.
4.  Finally, she failed to properly cut my hair.

I asked her how long she has been cutting hair?? She stated to me that she has only been cutting for a year!!!!  Bingo.  At that moment, I ended the cut (should have ended earlier).  I requested a more seasoned barber to fix the work. 

After this experience, I can only say STAY away from this barber shop.  It was definitely a NON-Fantastic experience.  

So upset that I felt compelled to log an issue and provide feedback to their corporate office.Beware Ear, Nose & Throat Consultants of Nevada. Arrived early for 2pm appointment.. Brought back after hour and 15 minutes in the waiting room and I'm still waiting. There must be a better way to treat your paying patients (customers)!Closed several years ago.This store needs a MAJOR makeover. I feel like I'm walking back into the mid 80's when I go in there...which isn't very often because its just dirty and old in there. They also don't carry a lot of things that I find in other stores. Come on Albertsons give this store a makeover it's practically in my backyard and would be a huge convienance  for me!! 
Lets move that bus!!!!All Starbucks are the same, the only thing that differs is the service of the baristas and at this location they're so SLOW! And this is because they're chatting and on their cell phones. I've experienced this multiple times and it's frustrating when a 5 minute coffee takes 15!I was always a fan of Carrabba's, but lately the food is so disappointing.  Much much to salty, and I love salt.  The food has been over cooked and not properly cooked either.  The wait staff has been great, too bad the kitchen cannot keep up.I went with my wife and friend.We all three had different items and all of them were very bland and had very little flavor.  We spent $50 ( with the tip) and felt we had received very little for the money.  I had not been to a Carrabba's in a few years and it maybe a century before I would try it again.  Don't waste your money.  The Blue Beer was great but then again they did not make it.Not very good, They are trying to come off as a high class place but don't meet the mark. We went with a coupon from KSHP for $25 for $6. The sign above the door said pints of Bud Light for $2.75 so I asked about them and the waitress said it was only during happy hour or if football was on the TV. Well there was a bowl game going and she said it did not count. So they were $4 each.
My wife ordered a Caesar Salad with chicken. It was like $14 the dressing was the worse we have ever tasted way too much lemon juice. The chicken was just warmed up but still cold.
I got a burger and it was just so so not worth $11 but the fries were good though. Would I go back no not even with a KSHP coupon. 
The waitress was slow and the noise from the grill area really loud, vents.the service here is horrible. last time we went, no one greeted us, talked to us or took our order. we were completely ignored. we sat there for about 10-15 mins and no one came up to our table. we didn't know if the kitchen was closed or not. you wanna know how long we waited? we were able to call another restaurant and place an order for pick up! we left shortly after that and even then no one acknowledge us.Went here one time & the bartender had zero personality. Made our experience really boring especially for a Friday night, it made sense why there were only 5 people there in the whole restaurant. Food was decent, but we will not be returning. At least when I bartend I say hi to all my customers and have small talk so I receive bigger tips than most. Just put a smile on your face & be cheerful makes a huge difference then being cold to everyone at the bar top..The summerlin location is a joke. We normally see dr ky in centinnel hills, but wee not able to get a same day appt. there today so they sent us here. We waited just under an hour to be seen and the waiting room was packed. I feel like if my daughter wasn't sick coming in she would be sick by the time we left. Next time I will take her to quick care.If I could give 0 stars, I would. Not only did this location lose my car's registration after emptying out my glovebox to take out my cabin filters (not to mention sent me home with SOMEONE ELSE'S), but after I got home and inspected the air filter, I noticed they didn't even reconnect the hoses - they just lashed it down on top of each other!! When I called about the registration they said they wouldn't have emptied the glovebox, but on a Honda you have to to get to the cabin filters - which they take out to show you if you want replacing. Will never go back, have never had a worse experience just trying to get a simple oil change.I know this place has good reviews, and maybe some people have found this place helpful, but if you have a serious problem I really suggest going elsewhere. I never write reviews, which should tell you just how horrible this place is...

About a month ago I got a UTI (first one in my life).  I found this place online, read good reviews, called to see if I could make an appointment, but they only take walk-ins so I went right down.  The front desk is very short with you and rude, which I didn't really care at first.  I filled out the paperwork and only had to wait about 10 minutes before they took me back to take my blood pressure, my weight, and then a urine test.  I waited in the room for a couple minutes before the doctor came in.  We only spoke for a couple minutes and then he prescribed me antibiotics and a pain reliever.  I took the antibiotics for a week and my UTI seemed to have gone away.  A month later I started getting the same pain again so I assumed I had gotten another UTI, but I was out of town so I called Legacy to see if they could call in a prescription to a pharmacy where I was.  They said no and that I had to come back in for another consult since it had been a month since my last visit.  I went back in 2-days later when I was back on town... Same process, weight, blood pressure, urine test.  I waited a couple minutes in the room and then a different doctor came in to speak with me.  She was nice, as was the previous doctor, she talked about her trip to Australia rather than discussing my UTI.  She then asked if I had an STD and I told her no, that my boyfriend and I have been living together for over 6 years, and then she asked me if I was sure he wasn't cheating on me.  Not exactly what you want to think about when you're trying to get treated for a UTI.  She then told me that this was most likely a continuation of the first UTI I was treated for a month ago and that the antibiotics the first doctor had prescribed for me doesn't typically work for UTI's.  I asked her why he would prescribe an antibiotic that is known not to work and she just said "I don't know".

I've been taking the new antibiotics for 7-days and with 3-days left to go the pain is worse than ever.  I called today to try to figure out what I should do and the front desk, who are all very rude and unhelpful, told me I had to come back in for another consult before they could prescribe a different antibiotic for me. After getting transferred around 4 times, and getting hung up on twice, one of the receptionists finally said she would pull up my chart and speak to a doctor and call me back.  Several hours later when I hadn't heard from them I called back, was placed on hold for another 10-15 minutes, hung up on again, and then finally Raven came on the line and said that I needed to come back in for another consult.  I told her I had just paid for 2 office visits, 2 urine tests, 2 different antibiotics, 2 pain relievers and that I was not going to come back in and pay for another consult & urine tests since I had just taken one a week ago.  I then asked her why the second doctor had told me that the first antibiotic doesn't typically work for UTI's and asked why they would still prescribe it to me anyway, she said the doctors I spoke with were just PA's and it's just their personal opinion and that I hadn't actually seen a doctor. She then told me again that I would need to come back for a consult to get a new antibiotic prescription.  I was very upset by this point and on the verge of tears from the pain and told her I was absolutely not going to come back in and pay for another visit and urine test and that I wanted to speak to a doctor right away.  She placed me on hold for another 20 minutes, then came back on the line and said the doctor wanted to prescribe me a new antibiotic and pain reliever.  I told her I was already taking that specific pain reliever and that it wasn't helping and she just said, "Well, this is a higher dosage and it should work".  I said I was already taking the higher dosage and it was not working.  She then said that's all she could do for me.  I just gave in and let her call in the prescription to my pharmacist.  When I got to the pharmacy the pharmacist was on the phone with Legacy Urgent Care about my prescription because they prescribed me an antibiotic that contains penicillin WHICH I AM ALLERGIC TO! Luckily the Pharmacist knew my allergies and called to double check the prescription.  When she got off the phone with Legacy Urgent Care, they had told her to just go ahead and prescribe it to me anyway, even knowing my allergy to penicillin.

I am very sorry I ever went to Legacy Urgent Care and spent the amount of $$ just to be prescribed antibiotics that don't work, and ones that I'm allergic to.  This urgent care is only about getting you in there for consults to charge $80 per visit, plus $8 for urine tests... Please go somewhere else if you can and don't give them your hard earned $$.Don't risk your clothes!!  We used them a few times and twice they lost items.  The first time, my husband happened to see his suits on the rack when they couldn't find them and the second time, they lost my shirt and claimed they had 30 days to find it.  We checked back periodically and finally it was there (two weeks or so later).  Not only did they not call us when they said they would, there was no apology and much attitude.  Not worth the convenience of the location.My family and I had by far the worst tire experience here! We were there for over 5 hours! When we first arrived they told us an hour and a half, then continued to say a few more minutes every time we would ask to see what was taking so long. Long story short, they ended up putting parts on our truck they didn't even talk to us about. The bill came to $1200 and something but we were told $762 when they started the truck. Avoid this place, they scammed a poor little old man before us as well, came in for an oil change and ended up spending 5 hours and over $700 dollars to leave again...poor Charlie. This place is filthy as well, dead bugs, broken lights, dirt EVERYWHERE......Go to Costco or Sams, trust me!This place is very unprofessional and does not know what customer service is. Called to make an appointment and the receptionist answered with hello?.. like her personal phone. She booked the appt. and when I showed up on Saturday, nobody was there. The doors were locked and nobody answered the phone or gave me a call back. Checked my credit card and it was already charged for the service that morning. I didnt receive a call back until the following monday afternoon when the receptionist tried to tell me I booked the wrong day! She had an attitude, called me an idiot and was not sorry. She then tried to tell me there was no manager there and that they did not charge my card. The charge is still on my account! Still have not heard from a manager or owner about any of this.BEWARE! MUST READ::::::Where to start. Well let me say I am a female in my 20's who obviously seemed like an easy target for these crooks. I have my personal mechanic who is also a close friend of mine and he usually does everything with my vehicles. I needed an oil change and was impatient, so I made the decision to go to auto tech in anthem because they had a groupon and it was close to home. BIG MISTAKE. What seemed like a simple oil change turned into one big head ache. I took my car in at 9am & was out by 10am. Fast right? That's nice I thought. The man behind the counter said "alright you're all good and ready to go." I left, everything was fine, or so I thought. About 15 mins into driving my oil light turned on and kept flashing and dinging repeatedly. I called auto tech immediately and told then what was going on. The guy said to bring it in they'd check it out. I had work and no time to bring it in ASAP so I brought it in a couple days later because I had checked my oil levels and it was clean and full. They had done the oil change. Cool. So I called back a couple days later asking to bring it in because the oil light was incredibly annoying and I finally had a day off and time to go up there. The man on the phone said he remembered me and said that my car was leaking and my oil pressure sensor was out...umm why didn't they tell me this initially before letting me drive off& even after I called the first day they never told me this???? SO I knew something was up. I brought my car up there and they looked at it and "confirmed" that I was leaking and my sensor was out. They said it would be $200 to replace. Well me not trusting these people I went to MY mechanic who looked at my car and wow. You know what he found? My oil pressure sensor unplugged. Those bastards unplugged it and tried getting $200 from me! Long shorty short, my cars light no longer goes off, my car doesn't leak. It never has. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE! They are just a bunch of crooks looking to pocket people's money. Typical.Signed in, waited for an hour and a half before they called me to the front desk to speak with someone, only to find out that they no longer accept my insurance. The wait could have been avoided if their sign-in process wasn't so screwed up and they weren't so understaffed. Customer service was generally slow, and somewhat rude. The wait times of other people ranged from 1-2.5 hours. I don't understand how they stay in business. Avoid if at all possible. If you must go, make sure you make an appointment and print out proof of the appointment.This place is so close to home and as much as I usually love ice cream and wanted to love it I really am annoyed by this place. I've been here 3 times. Something is wrong every single time. Hair in my food once. I bought a groupon but the employee was totally lost on how to redeem it so just flat out did not accept it. Forgot an item from my order.No bathroom! I can only imagine how many people get sick from eating with dirty hands. 

If you drink coffee or tea you have to ask the sandwich makers for sweeteners because they don't have them in the drinks are. 

At least they have spinach and not only lettuce. I've been to so many that only have lettuce.Horrific. Ordered a cheef.... bread was stale and chewy, the meat was crispy and tasted like dog food....horrific, the cheese was rubbery... And though I ordered extra giardinara... hardly any came. The breaded mushrooms were soggy and tasted like they were sitting under a heat lamp for hours, the garlic knots were chewy and there was nothing garlic about the chewy bread I received. Not to mention it took an hour and a half when the girl on the phone said 45 minutes to an hour. This place used to be good... I will NEVER order from here againWow came here on sat at 12 pm we did get seated right away .10 min later the waitress got our drink order didn't ask if we were ready to order we were! Another ten min goes by no drinks no order. My son was very thirsty so I asked another waiter if we could get his apple juice .He said yes and then I saw him talking to our waitress. A thew min later we got our drinks and she took our order this took like 20 min. She never gave us silverware so we got it off another table. She never came back except to bring the check I asked for a to go cup. we paid  the bill $42. I am a waitress too so I left a $10 tip. Then we sat a waited 10 mins for my to go cup. Got home and none of the food sat well with us. Never again will I go to IhopWe went to the club that was in the Artisan, and it was definitely and interesting time. Some in a good way and some not. We had gotten there a bit early, around 11pm. When we got there, were was barely anyone there, so the bar wasn't packed at all, and the bartenders basically decided not to serve us for at least 30minutes. It seemed like a last resort for them to serve us. We had 7 girls, and waited at least 30 minutes each time to get a drink. Even when I went by myself, I had to wait at least 15 minutes longer than anyone else, even people that showed up after me got drinks before I did. It was pretty ridiculous, and I'm a fairly patience person. Our guy friends had gotten a table and had ordered 2 bottles, and it took the waitresses at least 45minutes to bring out the bottles, mind you, there was still barely anyone at the club, so there was no reason why it should've taken so long to get drinks. 
The crowd was quite eclectic. There were some people dressed up because it is Vegas, but then since this is off the strip, there were people dressed up as cows, Jesus, and prisoners. So basically, you can show up wearing whatever to this place, I honestly think there isn't a dress code. Later in the night, it started filling up, but we only stayed till about 230a. It was ok, not a fav, especially since the service was pretty horrible.Our favorate noodle place closed down for good (noodle palace). Very glad we found this place. Food is good and comes very quick. Edited on 12/18/13. We stopped coming here because of the roaches that were crawling on the walls and because of a server who didn't wash their hands after using the restroom. Absolutely disgusting.Our family discovered this restaurant last years. We liked the. Simple Chinese food and the prices were inexpensive. We just visited this cafe twice in a week. The first trip we found a used tea bag in the tea pot  the server gave us. I brought it to the Manager attention and he apologized sincerely. he explained that sometimes customers bring their own tea bag into the restaurant. Since we enjoyed the food, we decided to let the matter rest. Two days later, we visited this restaurant again. The food was reasonably tasty. However, when we asked for the bill, that is when our entire experience went down the drain! We normally do not check the items listed on the receipt and like many we merely pay the total amount as shown. This time for no reason we checked the items listed on the bill and found out shockingly that an item of $3/- was automatically added into the bill without even informing the customer! Normally we leave cash on the table but in this instance we were shocked! how can a waitress or establishment secretly and automatically add on "tips" onto the bill and not inform the customer? Also if we did not even notice the "tips" we would have double tip bec we always leave 20% behind anyway! When we confronted the waitress and asked how can she do such a secretive billing, she merely tried to cover it up by giving ridiculous reasons ..she explained that when the convention is in town, they always add automatic tip onto every customer bill. Such practice left us totally disgusted and we pledged we will not visit this establishment ever. We learn now to check every item on the bill because you never know what extra item can be added. 

Alash a cheating waitress drove away future customer business...what a shame!Service is bad and also the food here are awful. Prob is one of the worst Chinese food. Not gonna come back here again.Yo yo, this is 'Genny' (short for General, not Jennifer!) from Ed's review.  

Ok, the pho is good I thought.  They hook up the meat and I gotta get my protein, so I liked the place.  Its been a tradition to hit up phokimlong every time we go to vegas, mostly cuz the name is funny.  'Yo lets go phokimlong!'

But this tradition is gettin the BAN.  We've seen the pretty girl that works there before, but this time when we went, we didnt see her.  We ordered, ate, then I went to go pee.  I get back, and my homie says 'hey genny theres your girl'.  Cool, I was gonna say what up when we left.  Note that nothing disrespectful was said!

But then little asian gumby the BUSBOY had to come and butt in our convo.  Now if you're gonna step up, step up correct.  He comes in with his head down, whispering 'why you talkin about my fiance?'  Then he just leaves.  I barely heard what he said, so I was like is dude serious?  I was gonna let it slide and talk to pretty girl when we left, but big homie Bolo Eddie had to go see what was up with gumby, and thats when the managers got scared and started callin the mexis workin in the back to come in.  I went with him, so it killed my chance with talkin to homegirl :(

So my ratings are:
Food: 4 - lots of meat, meatballs are pretty bomb
Service: NEGATIVE 5 - busboy, stick to refilling water and cleanin up dishes
Cleanness: 1 - not the cleannest place, we're not in viet anymore

Well I'm bout to get off work now, so I'll end this.  To the pretty girl, if you see this, I was the dude with the Coolio hair, how are you doin?  Hit me up sometime :)I would rate this place a zero if Yelp would allow it. They really Pho-ked us long. 

My friend ordered a Mabo tofu dish and it was evident after everyone else had finished their meals, that it was NEVER coming. Our waiter was not to be seen, so we flagged another table's waiter asking if he could check on the status of our order. This waiter's attitude was horribly rude and condescending. And instead of going to check, he decided to state that Mabo tofu takes a long time. Really? It doesnt take long to prep and fry up some tofu, meat and sauce in a wok and pour the deal over rice. I've made this dish plenty of times, there really are no good excuses. Were they still growing the rice out in the paddies in the back? Soybeans still being picked? Were they picking their chopsticks from out of their asses? 

Finally, our waiter came by after a few centuries and by this time everyone else had finished their meals. So we said, "We ordered a Mabo Tofu which we'd like to...", And instead of allowing us to complete a sentence--he waved us off rudely while making a hostile face and impatiently hurried to the back. The missing dish decided to make an appearance after a few minutes(which suspiciously looked like it was freshly cooked after we inquired about it). Finally we were able to tell him we wanted to cancel our order because it was so very late. Then he proceeded to shoot us a NASTY look as if it were our fault for wasting their time and food. Really? The food was already 30 minutes late by that time. When the bill came, they still charged us for steamed rice and the gratuity was already included on the bill--which at this point added insult to injury. Again, we asked them to remove the sneaky rice from our bill. No apologies by their management or the waiters for slothful, inattentive service or hostile waiters.  

Also, their Pho, while just ok, is OVERLY PRICED at $8-10 a pop. Most Pho places are at a reasonable $4-7. I will never go here again. Horrible customer service (Please just look up all the other millions of 1 to 3 star reviews as well!)Don't order vermicelli unless you want to wait 45 mins for it, which is by the time everyone at your table is finished with their pho. 

The service is also horrible. They are not attentive in the slightest bit and the cashier got in an argument with my friend about the receipt. Also, we were told we could use multiple credit cards for our check and we wrote out how much goes on each card trying to make it easier for the cashier but as he started punching in all the numbers he just gave up and rudely gave me back everything and demanded it all be on 1 card. Oh and we also had to wait 15 minutes just to even get the check.

The food was average. I felt like you can get this stuff anywhere. 

Come here if you want your day ruined.Worst experience ever. DO NOT EAT HERE.The only reason I'm giving one star is because the potstickers were amazing. But that is the only good thing about this restaurant. The service we horrible. The waiters throw things on the table and don't  check back and the check was never brought. The cashier was highly disrespectful and rude. Do not eat here. There are other Vietnamese restaurants in town. Find a more friendly location.This place has the worst customer service.  They would give you a hard time if you ask why your food takes so long to come.  They yelled at me when i asked for a tea cup and sort of throw it to my face.  And be aware, tips are included in your bill.  Would you pay 15% tips for that kind of service?  I would never come back to this place.Viet food is below average. Service is great. Price is too high for mostly unfavorable viet food. I am from Los Angeles, I know good Viet food, this place is just average.
I recommend you go down the street at Krung Siam for favorable Thai food with actual spices and the pricing is very fair.Extremely rude patrons, specially KEN, the manager.  I ordered fried rice and Vegan Pho , to my disbelief the rice wasn't fried and my Pho was lukewarm, so I waved the server down and asked him to have the rice re-fried, the fried rice I received afterwards was bathed in oil and mushy.  I asked one of the random servers to take it back after waiting over five minutes for someone to come check and see if I was satisfied.  I asked for a freshly prepared rice dish and again  I got mushy fried rice!   I stood up and walked to the cashier, the cashier is the manager, well this m*t*h*e*r%^&*#$, told me how this is how  traditional fried rice is made, and that this is the way they make the rice, and that he wasn't my servant, a comment he made after I told him how the customer is always right .  I proceeded to tell him how it wasn't traditional fried rice and that I wasn't  going to eat it or pay for something that I haven't eaten, he refused to give me my money back and told me to dispute it with my bank.  I came back to my table and the security guard asked me to step outside, I was embarrassed, cold, and my girl was left hungry.   I was treated like a drunk fool, and I wasn't even drunk.  The security guard tried to mediate the situation having me and my girl wait outside in the cold while he would go inside and talk to Ken the manager.  Well, the guard told me that Ken didn't want to deal with the situation anymore and that he was just going to make the fried rice (to go) one more time and that he was done bartering with me. 

p.s.  food is overpriced and their quality doesn't match, spend your money elsewhere.i never wrote review in my life but today one server is making me to. i always come here and still might come but i am so UPSET. one server who brought us the dishes was extremely rude!!! dishes of my friend n i were switched n i didn't know so i asked. he said "i said thats number 13 " in a very rude annoyed way. then he just went away. also he threw other dishes at our table. 
I dont even want to give one star. My bf n I always give more than 18% tip however not today. 
I always order number 13 which is combination pho. there were no meats today. I wanted to say something but I was so upset already I did not want to say another word. 
I know this place is always crowded so the service isnt so good but i ate around 3pm. Also it never wasn't that bad. Today was the WROST EVER!! i'll go to other placesFood is nothing more than ok. Service is horrible. I wish people would stop going there so they can learn their lesson.This place used to be my goto place for pho and bun. Now, every time I go there it just plain stinks. It smells like wet rag. The service sucks, nobody checks on you, and it's too crowded. Gross. Never coming here again. Jenni pho is my go to place now. Cleaner, well decorated, and pho tastes better.Worst Office Depot ever.  The employee at the copy center doesn't know how to change the copy machine from Legal to letter size. He was extremely rude.This was my regular grocery store for 2 1/2 years. It was the only grocery store in the neighborhood. You could walk in easily find a cart, they have wide aisles and plenty of selection. However the meats are poorly cut-a rookie or inexperienced butcher I presume. Of course the prices were a little cheaper than Vons,Smiths or Wal-mart BUT now they have remodeled and the prices are no longer LESS, there are tons of people every time you go and long lines, broken carts and the produce is lackluster at best. Lots of little Mexican kids running unattended throughout the store and when you finally go to get out of there there's usually 1 or if your lucky 2 cashiers. The belts are always dirty & sticky and you have to bag your own shit while a mentally challenged employee stands by and stares into space. Never any help bagging and definitely nobody to assist you to the car which explains why you never see elderly people here. On one occasion I saw a homeless lady walking through the store and when we were in the parking lot 2 employees came out after her and tackled her to the ground claiming she had shoplifted-very unprofessional. 
If you like rubbing elbows with illegals and bums to wait forever to buy overpriced below average quality stuff-this is probably your store of choice.Facial Waxing - DO NOT COME HERE.  NO WONDER WHY IT'S FOR $5

She asked me to lay down and wait in the waxing room. Okay. The sheet covering the waxing table looked used. 

She finally came in and rushed into the wax without changing the stick or cleaning the area to be waxed. She just slapped a big wad of wax on my face and mostly to skin areas that did not need any waxing! I asked kindly to please slow down, you are putting wax in areas that is not needed. She became annoyed and kept doing what she was doing.  I got up, complained, stormed out of there and didn't pay! 

Dirty stick, hands and god knows what! I was livid!!Came here for a mani and pedi... Waiting in the spa chair for 45 minutes and I walked out! Very low staffed... Run down! Stay away!Overpriced for cheap work! Got my $45 gel fill on Sunday and this is what it was by Wednesday(pic). Went back to have them redo the awful work and surprise surprise the gel peeled off the very next day. Save your money and time go elsewhere.The absolute worst nail experience I have ever had !!! I went for a gel manicure and a pedicure.  Mimi was not pleasant nor friendly, never smiled, no personality.  Then the tools were not sterilized ! And there was no cleaning of my feet with any nice abrasive scrub.  I actually have to go home and work on my feet with my own products and tools.  She finished with a very quick polish and then started my manicure .  I noticed there was polish all around the skin of my toes .  Very sloppy ! Of course I asked her to clean it up which she did .  Then the manicure .  I had a tear in my nail . Usually don't they just repair it . Not Mimi .  She was ready to polish right over it .  So I asked before she polishes if she would repair the nail .  She said if you want perfect nails get acrylics ! Miss personality ! I picked a color based on their selections .  Well another horrible experience ! The color looks nothing like the chart she shows you ! My nails are almost black.  She said the sample was only one coat ! Ha ! Even with one coat it was nothing like the color on my nails. Then she asked if I wanted to start over with a new color .  By this time all I wanted was this experience to be over .  Now I have almost black nails with bubbles .  She didn't even use any moisturizer on my hands when she finished the manicure .  The salon and Mimi are a mess.  I can't imagine why anyone would ever be a return customer .  The salon wasn't busy either .  Lesson learned .  I'll never return and you shouldn't waste your time or money going there either !Apparently Yelp hides reviews written in Spanish or sends them to the bottom.  Being that this restaurant is a Latin restaurant where most clients speak Spanish, I wrote my review in Spanish but here's my review in English.

THREE TIMES, I have received bad food!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for Salvadorean food.

I tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food, I just decided its best to let go.

The chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible.  The meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh.  When these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problem.

The last time, I ordered to go and was so angry after I got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish. Gross. I immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night. So I was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home. 

The next day and the following days after, nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner, even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge.  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund, and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish, the fish ONLY because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par.  seriously?lol i laughed at their lack of professionalism.  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items? a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience. that means the salad, the rice as well.  so that day they only gave me a fish! LOL i felt that i was transported to El Salvador, a third world country.  Certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practice.

They're a joke! The food is horrible. The chicken and fish is not fresh. Even the second fish was in the same condition.  One of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things. She even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that, some times.  

Only because you are a Latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service.  There are many other Latin restaurants that do a great job.  This place needs to take notes from them.The staff is rude.  never get the order correct.I love this restaurant but today it was the worst experience ever!!! Server was not nice at all and the food was horrible not to mention the service.... A place I would never come back.....Again, Please Yelp I don't want to leave a star!!!!

My sister was in town for 3 weeks so we thought we would take her for a nice seafood dinner. We had heard that Landry's was a good place with great atmosphere. We entered and were greeted by a very nice young woman that sat us right away.

We were seated and waited about 10 minutes but that was ok since they were so busy. Our server arrived and we ordered our drinks and since we had waited we were also ready to order our food. This seemed to bother our server as I guess we broke her rhythm. I made the mistake of ordering iced tea because I never got a refill until I was almost done with my meal and I had to ask again to even get that because she forgot. The food was so so not really in keeping with all the hype we had gotten about the restaurant. Long John Silver would have been better....no kidding. The fish wasn't blackened like we asked, the shrimp were cut in half to make them look bigger on the plate and my sisters meal was mostly a bunch of fried greasy onion strings again to make the plate look full. Our server brought the check and didn't even ask if we would like dessert. Poor Service means we won't be going back.Seafood was wonderful and unusual. Stay away from the Bar.......K is a witch with a lousy attitude.  She serves you her way and then BItches at you when you correct her. K when you sneeze and blow your noise...... Wash your hands!!Im from New Orleans so I thought my Mom would love this for Mothers Day...WRONG!! The service was excruciatingly slow..was seated literally 20 mins before water arrived, antother 6 before 3 of the 5 drinks ordered came to the table. food took forever to come from the kitchen (and no, they werent too busy) and it was below average!! If youre looking for hometown food SKIP THIS PLACE AND HEAD TO LOLA'S!!!This WAS my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Until one late night when I brought my family from California here, bragging to them that this was the best place in Las Vegas. Service was horrendous. I ordered the beef stew with egg noodle soup. I cannot believe they let this out of the kitchen. It looked like watered down beef boullion cubes with hard fatty beef.It was gross....I pretended that I enjoyed it just to save face. I don't understand. I've had this dish hundreds of times and it was always spot on. I've been a loyal pho so 1 customer since 1998. I'm astonihhed that they served such horrible food. Maybe ...it was a fluke but not to be harsh. I expect better...way better. Pho so 1 ship shape up and get your act together because Saigon # 8 is right down the street!!!!As a vegetarian, I have to tell you that I was pretty excited to see a place called "Tofu Hut" -- open 24 hours a day, even!

When I finally made my way over there with a fellow vegetarian (the only person who could possibly be as excited as I was about a restaurant called "Tofu Hut"), I have to say we VERY disappointed.

As far as I could tell, there were only two tofu dishes on the entire menu.  And they both had meat in them, too.  This was apparently more of a Korean BBQ place than a vegetarian haven.

Not only was its name misleading, I found the inside to be very unclean... When I ate there the first time, I didn't touch my food.  Needless to say, I wouldn't eat there again.  Ever.I've had several different Korean BBQs. I wasn't feeling this one. The table we had had poor ventilation and I got smoked out and I got so hot I didn't feel like eating. That and none of the food really had any flavor to speak of. There are better options in the area.I will never go to this place again. The quality of food is very poor and the servis is terrible. I wound not recommend this horrible place.If you ever find yourself in one of about 700 Dotty's in Las Vegas, you know you have a problem. Imagine your grandmother's living room. Now fill it with slot machines and degenerate gambling addicts. If I remember correctly, they'll comp your drink if you're playing a nickel slot machine.I really really hate leaving bad reviews but sometimes they are well-deserved.  

The only positive thing I can say is that the ladies who work here are nice.  What was not nice is the completely jacked up gel nails I got when I stopped here on a whim when my regular lady at Luxury Nails was booked.  The bed of each of my nails had crazy white streaks all over when she was finished. When I pointed it out and asked what the heck it was, she acted like there was nothing there.  It was really noticeable so I don't know why she thought this was the best way to handle it.

Then the entire staff came over and examined my nails and the lady who seemed like the owner explained that it was my crappy real nails.  Yes.  I have crappy real nails, which is why I get gel in the first place!  But I have never had this happen and I've had gel nails for months.  The suggestion was for me to have each of my nails buffed down to paper thin status and re-apply the gel.  This was done with only some improvement.  I left with my nails looking like complete garbage.  They are not even filed right, so even if I was going to buy the argument that this little situation is somehow the fault of my genetics, it does not explain not even filing the ends properly.  

Do NOT go here for gel nails!They might be good for women, but the cannot tailor a suit. They ruined my brand new expensive suit. They closed suit panels and rebuilt the entire jacket.  They were so confident that they didn't measure or mark...and it showed. Neither the jacket nor pants fit at all. Worse, the alterations were not changeable afterwards. 

Then they charged me $220 for the honor of ruining my suit. Beyond a hem or a cuff don't go here...run far away.Let's not kid ourselves here - the owner of this place is an Asshole with a capital A.

The guy simply DOES NOT ALLOW BROWSING in the store. He follows you around, requiring you to be looking for something specific. The merchandise isn't priced, so you have to ask him the price on everything. I happen to know from experience he quotes different people different prices on the same records. On top of that, he's just plain rude, and not even that knowledgeable.. The only reason I can imagine this guy is still in business is that he sold his soul to the devil. Go on any other site and look for reviews of this place. NONE of them are good. This guy is THAT bad.

You're running a RECORD STORE, jackass. NOT A MUSEUM!

The actual "store" itself is just a converted house, and it is cluttered as hell. This place would have benefited enormously from being in an actual business space. If you thought those tiny, crowded aisles in Record City were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. 

Oh, and did I mention he sells bootleg recordings in the store? Last time I checked that was illegal.

Avoid this place like the plague! You'll be ripped off, chewed out, and put down by a guy who couldn't give the real record store experience if it crawled up and bit him. It's times like this i wish I could give less than one star.

Selection: B-
Service: FI am from Germany and have been visiting LV once a year since 1999 for the Viva Las Vegas Rock'n'Roll Weekender. I have been collecting records since I was 12 or so and I agree that this is the worst record store ever.
The guy really thinks he is the Einstein of Rock'n'Roll because he has got a Doowop-Show on some local radio station. Unfortunately he doesn't know half as much about music as he thinks. 
His stuff is ridiculously (do you say so?) overpriced. Even in Germany most of the stuff is cheaper than in his shack.
Although I have plenty of time to spend while my wife is relaxing at the pool, I'd rather spend my time watching wallpaint getting dry. I went there twice and haven't set a foot into this xxx store since 2003!Although there IS a great selection the owner is very ignorant when it comes to prices (on the punk stuff). None of the items are priced and he will "size you up" and give you (very HIGH) prices after he checks you out to see what he can get out of you. Good stuff but a RIP OFF! I would avoid unless you just want to look.
BillMy girlfriends and I were having lunch at Pho So 1 before heading home after a bachelorette party this past wkend and I happen to see this nail place in the same plaza. After everyone had to drive home or fly home, only me and another gf were left and I had some time to spare before I flew home so we decided to get our nails done.
I could already tell it was not going to be a good exp. as the place looks old and dinghy. 
I had one of the youngest gal working on me. She did both my pedi and mani. For my pedicure, she did fine up until the polishing...she didn't know how to polish this light color I wanted-she did 3 coats and it just globbed and way too thick. For my mani, while filing my nails, she nicked me with the filer and I had to stop her. I opted for a French manicure since she couldn't paint my toe nails with that color and she couldn't even do it right with the french manicure either. When we left, there were bubbles on my finger nails and it was just horrible.  She took over 1.5 hrs for my mani and pedi. We had nice conversations since we both speak the same language. I felt bad for this girl cuz she took a long time on my nails so I gave her some tip but I'm NEVER coming back to this place when I go to Vegas next time. I know I shouldn't even tip her for the botched up work and that just reinforces her but I can't walk away without tipping anyone...I was very upset with the quailty of the pizza i got from this location, i got 2 large pizzas they were both very undercooked i coulda rolled the pizza up like a burrito it was soggy,after a debate with the tough guy at the register he agreed to put the pizzas back in the oven. they were still not right it ruined my whole day. i would not recommend this location to anyone.boohoo cry cry.  I wanted .. I expected... well dunno but I didn't get it here.

We got the pork adobo because of Ed V.'s review, and the Hula plate because it sounded good.  Both were NOT good.  They ran out of the pork adobo, so they said try the new chicken adobo we have.  It was too salty and basically just tasted like chicken boiled in shoyu, dry, salty.  The rice was no good, the mac salad was warm, the Hula plate was all fried seafood bleh.  bleh.This is not a place you'd want to go to for lunch if you need to be back at work on time.  Took me 25 minutes to get my order because the cook and the cashier forgot my order.  A gal working there actually offered me free lumpia but I was too pissed off to want to eat anything from them.  This isn't the first time they took too long to get my order but it was definitely the last straw.  If it wasn't for the reasonable price, I wouldn't have came back.  But I'm done with this place.  

On another note, the food here is very salty.Oh boy oh boy.... Where do I begin..  I saw their advertisement for about 2 weeks for their xmas day buffet for $15.  The list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items.  I arrived there around 7.  It was fairly quiet/empty and figured most people came there earlier. There were probably only 20 people in there when I arrived.  
1st off the service was great. The employees were very nice and I definitely expected that being in a hawiian restaurant.  The place was also very clean and that too was not an issue.  

The food is the main issue here.  When I walked upto the buffet, the sushi table had 3 basic rolls on there and was ok at best.  The lumpia was probably the most decent thing I ate.  I was in total shock when I saw the spam musubi.  They had it all nice looking, all cut in half in nice big pieces (this would've been perfect but NOOOO they screwed it up.) They had some sort of sauce on ALL of it. The problem is you CAN'T put sauce on a rice item like this that is sitting there.  I had one bite and it completely fell apart in my hand because the sauce had made the whole thing mushy.  

The katsu was overcooked and dried out.  The halfway decent stir fry veggies were sorta ok but they were sitting under a heat lamp and getting mushy and all in all lacked flavor.  The curry was very bland. I tried a little of a few other dishes and again everything was bland and blah.  I was completely disappointed in the macaroni salad. WOW it had nooooo flavor to it. It was just simply mayonaisse.  

The desserts were store bought donuts, some chocolate chip cookies, and some funky brownies.  and btw I saw other people sitting around me making faces too about the food. 

There's a few problems here. #1 let's compare apples to apples... Aloha kitchen vs L&L Hawaiian. This buffet gave me a really good idea of what their food is like if I ordered it off their regular menu (vs buffet style) I have been to L&L many many times and wow they are definitely a LOT better then Aloha.  I have tried several things on their menu and everything has been flavorful, yummy, not over cooked and their macaroni salad is great too.   1 out of 10.. Aloha you're a 1.  L&L a 10.
There was nothing good about the food at Aloha and I was VERY disappointed.  Now comparison #2.  Although now I'm comparing apples to oranges but still.  

Aloha vs buffet @ asia which is just minutes up the street.  Aloha, you can not charge $15 for what you put on that buffet with that kind of quality.  Buffet @ Asia is WAY better then you in quality and selection for the same price.  Just sushi alone puts you to shame (and they don't have any fantastic sushi either but it's way better then yours)  and with Sushi Mon being 10 min up the street as well, they blow both places out of the water.  

It's very tough to run a good restaurant, but if L&L can have almost all the same menu items and they do it right with quality, and taste and the same price, then so can you. Aloha kitchen.... You're a discrace to good hawaiian food.  

I will continue my business at L&LStopped in tonight to kill some time and grab a light bite during happy hours. Jammie, our barmaid couldn't seem to get it right on more than one account. My wife and I had trouble putting cash in the poker machines.. Jammie helped get the two $20 bills in the machines that we played. We ordered our drinks and were charged 10 bucks while playing. I asked if they comp'd drinks and she said yes, but you have to play $10 to qualify. HUH?? We just played $40- We ordered Nachos and were brought Irish Nachos (french fries w/ bacon and other crap on it). Oops, my mistake again, I guess!
No apology, no comp, NO WAY will we return.. Bummer.This shop is such a disappointment. Found on yelp &due to the highly raved reviews, called the shop owner to inquire about electrical work and cost/hour. Brought it in, and w/o much an inquiry as for why I was there he scurried off w/ the keys to bring it into the garage. Asked the reason but didn't let much time for explanation or history. Did not bother with writing up a work order; just had the tech test my battery &came back saying nothing's wrong -.- Theres a problem to begin with that brought me there!! Anyways asked them to perform an electrical draw, waited 3 1/2 hours later.. the onwer, Mr Tanaka(?) very hard to understood and was difficult to communicate with said they do not deal with electrical problems and that I needed to leave and take it to a dealership -_____- He was extremely rude and raised his voice many times during the conversation.  I came in asking for work on an electrical problem. He neglected to listen and ran tests on the battery instead. The tech took my car panel apart and did not put it back together properly. Lack of training or just carelessness; he disconnected the AC wires. AC was on, set to 66 degrees and on high. Control panel completely disconnected from the board and did not respond. Gear shift was loosely thrown together. It was sticky and was difficult to put into Park!! So much problems with this shop. Made the mistake that just because it was called JAPANESE CAR SERVICE that does not mean they are familiar with japanese cars, its just that they are OWNED by japanese people. Silly me, did not even think of that. Main problem was that having known they are not familiar with electrical problems they should not have taken the car apart in trying to find an electrical draw. Yelp reviews are misleading, this is the first time yelp let me down ):I have came to Little Darlings 4 different occasions and every time I was dissatisfied. I love entertainers and the technically of dancing. Yet, this is NOT the place to enjoy it. 
Cover for locals is $17 and $33 for outsiders, includes soda beverages at the bar. I have attended by myself AND with friends. We all agreed that the size of the venue was great but the atmosphere depressing. The entire night seemed unorganized. The dancers walk/stand around with scrunched mean faces and uncomfortable body language. I noticed they only smile when approaching a customer to converse. That being said 3 out of the 4 times i attended, I was never approached. Little do the women know I have $200+ for someone with good conversation and a nice smile. Oh well. 

I think the top 2 buzz killers for me was the DJ and the Dancers. The music ranges from rock n' roll, 80s, to hip hop. I love the variety but the transitions are horrible and the in between songs are almost annoying. The DJ's voice sounds like he is at an auction and you can never hear what he is saying 90% of the time. I am a firm believer that the DJ controls the hype and atmosphere of a club. And unfortunately I was very bored and distant.
The dancers are average when it comes to the skill level. They know maybe 1 or 2 pole tricks then attempt to shake their butt to their chosen tune. The majority of the dancers are beautiful in their own way.Eh, I'd say there's only 1 woman that I enjoyed watching. Jackie was here name. She was smiling and flirting and used the entire stage during her performance! She made me smile and had my eyes locked. I moved closer and threw her a big tip, she came over and thanked me. Her breast were so soft ^_^} After her performance she came over to my chair and thanked me again. I tipped her a $20 bill then released her to make more money. Its very difficult to watch the other dancers on stage without my face being twisted. They are not entertaining nor look like they enjoy their job. Smh. I can't bare to return.

I would recommend going to Lacey's. Full Nude Full Bar Strip club. Thursdays 9pm-4am Fridays-Saturdays 3am-7am This is the Hip Hop strip club of Las Vegas. 21+ $20 cover charge for all. IF YOU WANT AN ENTERTAINING STRIP CLUB WITH DRINKS, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND GREAT MUSIC THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!! Not Little Darlingsreally crappy restaurants, nothing for the kids to do and the rooms are very very small. Its right off the freeway. Plus they rolled on OJ. Never had any luck at the machines and the lines are almost always long on Friday & Saturday to cash your checks. The sports book is cool & so is subway. Bingo isnt half bad either. Burger King & the Guadalajara are all gone, the buffet is the worst and the cafe is closing & being replaced by a Denny's. Theres a decent Starbucks on the way out to the parking garage, the Broiler ain't half bad and you can never get a seat at the oyster bar which is the highlight of this place.  Ocassionally a decent giveaway to players club members.I stayed here years ago and had a good experience so when I saw a Groupon for it, I jumped on it, but I was quite dissapointed with our second stay here.

1) Vouchers (gaming chips, breakfast buffet to be included with the groupon deal) were not provided upon check in. Time was wasted standing in line later that night to obtain them after being told by a friend that they were provided upon check in. 
2) The employee that checked us in told me that internet was included in the fare and to select the $5.99 option when accessing the internet, but it would not be charged. However, when I tried to utilize the express check out, I found I was chrged $5.99 for each day we stayed T the hotel! I was charged $5.99 three times! More time was wasted standing in line so that I could sort it all out. No apology was given. 
3) The tub was awful and did not drain properly. Each time I showered, it filled the tub half way!

An absolute dissapointment. 

The breakfast was ok, but too greasy for me. I would have prefered more healthy options for sure.I was here to attend a dog show that had been planned for over a year.  I understand having dogs on the premisis is odd for most hotels although this hotel knew what was coming and was told what to expect.  Regardless, we were set up in the Courtyard which had no easy access to parking, unloading or even clean rooms.  The beginning staff at the front desk were extremely rude and it wasn't just a bad day.  There were five working and all five just did not want to be there.  I had to cheer up the girl I was working with just so I could endure the process.  My room was not ready at check in time and I had to come back later to actually get inside my room.  I had a dog with me and quite a bit to unload and its not like I came early.  The counter staff was very irritated I wanted my key to actually get inside my room.

They charged me 100 deposit of which I have yet to receive back ... will check that next week.  This was NOT disclosed upon making the reservation and I can understand the need since I did have dogs in my room but courtesy would say let me know this first.

The room service was awful.  I ordered coffee and only after not receiving it after an hour of waiting, I called and had to wait another 20 minutes.  The housekeeping staff moved the crate that had my dog in it when I clearly left a note saying do not touch.  There were no fresh towels in the room, just refolded towels that were already used.  The bathroom was disgusting with mold in the shower and grime and dirt all over the light fixtures.  The bed, I didn't dare look.  I had to sleep.

This hotel was contrcted and prepaid for a banquet for the group I was attending with and well, for $30.00 a person, we got salad, dried up chicken or BBQ meat (NO ROLLS!) and NO drink unless we wanted to pay $2.00 for a small bottle of water or $13.00 for a cup of coffee.  We had to tell the staff we needed tables and chairs as they planned on 50 people at this banquet using their laps and when clean up came, they were not pleased to do so and literally expected the guests to clean up for them.  One positive, I cut up the chicken and took it back to the room for my dog.

All in all, this hotel was a pit and not a chance in hell I will ever go back.God's Holy Trousers!!!

Pros: Oyster Bar
Cons: Everything from A to Z except for O. 

Seriously worse than a Roach Motel on a sunny day. The stay from the rooms, service and the Team Members has had left a bad taste. Vegas has better spots even for the budget minded but stay away from this joint.

(Forced to consider this as almost all the hot spots on or around the Strip were full due to SEMA 2013 Convention)The place is not bad for the price you pay for. I would give this place more stars if there wasn't of the miscommunication that the front desk provided us. If you decide to book this hotel, be prepared to their daily mandatory service fee $15 on top of room cost which is for poor service. Be aware that you might end up paying more than you expected.My frustration with the service and attitude of the servers was an experience I hope no one else receives. I was hoping to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere accompanied with an experience of outstanding culture food. The food was satisfactory !   But the constant need for a server was non existent . There were four other tables occupied  and have to wonder why only two servers- poor planning on your part.I really want to give this place 4 stars, love the food but their treatment of me doesn't allow me to do that. Let me explain.
The first time I come to Ichiza I request a table for 2. They tell me its going to be 20-30 minute wait for a table. Its busy so I understand. But I do start to see people who came after me get seated. I asked them about this and apparently those groups had reservations. I have my dining partner who is asian go in and request a table for two, they offer to seat her immediately, she comes out and gets me and it turns into "oh we were just about to call you for seating" I let it slide b/c its busy and I genuinely dont know if they were about to seat me or simply seated me then because of my friends influence. 
Now, fast forward several months. I go in and ask to be seated for 3. Im the first in my party to get there. Told there would be a 10 minute wait. my wait totals 30 minutes. in that time 2 parties of 2 are seated. I can visually see open seating. Again, I ask about my table for 3 and she states they had "reservations." Again, I send my asian friend in to request a table for 3 and they prepare to seat her. When I come in same story, "oh, we were just about to seat you." 
At this point, I get the picture. I was livid and so was the rest of my party, we refused to stay. I no longer support this business and will advise anyone else I know to do the same.I was a long time and loyal customer after I moved to Vegas 2 1/2 years ago and I went to this restaurant numerous times until when I start seem HUGE cockroaches. First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here's again and the owner's attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me. 

I swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn't the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?

It's a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won't have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there's no SERVICE at all. The owner's attitude is even worth to hell. Don't get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what's called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He's taking for granted especially for a long term customer. 

Not only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going.

I am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life.I went  here to meet a friend for dinner based on yelp reviews.  Yuckie!  As I opened the door to walk in I was hit by the aroma of spoiling fish.  YUCK!  I wasn't sure I could stand it.  Because there were only two of us, the waitress sat us at the sushi bar so now my neck hurts from having to constantly turn my head to talk to my friend.  The tongue was tough; a 1/5, the miso butterfish was 3/5.  Is that the best you have?  The ambiance was 1/5 with sticky counters and food stained menus.  Would not recommend to anyone.  $53.00 for two people for mediocre food and one beer for each of us.  Tons of menu items written on paper posted to the walls, but you can't read them if you are sitting at the Sushi bar.  Bad format, bad smells, bad ambiance, bad food.Received at least 38 demerits after inspection by the Southern Nevada Health District.  see the following article for details --http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.phpMy husband and I just left this store. The two ladies who worked there seemed like they would have rather been doing anything other than helping us. It seemed like we we were annoying them. Incredibly unhelpful and short with us. Why even be in business if your customer service is that horrible. On to the next fabric store!People are rude. My husband is caucasion but knows all the things we like. He has gone twice and twice, the check out guy treated him poorly. Like he wasn't even there. First time, the guy just looked at him and didn't say a word. The other time, he got passed up on line!!!
What is that about??Avoid this business.  There are plenty of other Glass Companies on the West Side of Las Vegas who do great work.  Here's my experience:  I've used them for years.  I've brought windows in for repair, and had them come out and install.  However, in the last few years their quality of work and customer service has deteriorated.  I had a Sliding Glass Door installed.  The frame pulled away from the wall, so I had to repair that.  Shortly after that, I had them come out for an estimate on a retro-fit from single to double pane.  They did not offer my wife any selection of frame color (she was naiive and didn't ask) so they picked what they wanted.  I could live with it, but the installers damaged the frame on install day.  I watched them hit it with a rubber mallet to try and bend my new window frame back in to shape.  They didn't know I was watching and got very quiet when I caught them.  I declined install that day.  They stalled for more than a month to "make good" on their failure.  On their word they were going to make a new frame, but instead replaced the bent section.  I cut them a break and approved the install due to my tenant's need for the window.  However, the installers were flippant when I refused the original install, and were patronizing when they came out with the repaired window.  I put that experience aside and tried again with something simple:  screens.  I brought two screens to have re-produced.  With the screens in hand, the measurements should have been exact. But, both sets of screens were made too large to fit the windows.  I compared the new screens in the shop with the old screens I had brought in, something that the shop should have done before calling me to pick them up.  But they didn't!  In addition,  I was told the screens would be ready by a Monday, but they were not ready until the Friday of that week.  Punctuality problem for the second time!   I declined the purchase of the wrongly made screens, grabbed my old screens (which I believe were never used by the sub for comparative measure) and went out to my truck.  The woman from the office came out to offer to "re-cut" the screens, but I declined and let her know that Dan Bradley Glass had lost my business.  I currently own many rental properties in Las Vegas and have a complete retrofit planned for one of the houses.  Dan Bradley has lost that job, in addition to any of the future repairs that property managers inevitably face as part of the cost of renting houses, condos, and townhouses.  I recommend avoiding this business to avoid the frustration with a company that is clearly failing the basic commitment to providing quality work and customer service.For a while they were known as the go to place for Chinese BBQ. Now I wonder how they stay in business. With crooked practices, you have to watch them carefully.

On a few occasions, my family and I have been cheated by them. They have calculated our bill wrong. Then there are the times that they have taken a duck leg when we ordered a whole bird to take home. A one legged duck is not a common sight, so I do not know how they thought they could get away with it. My dad did not let this slide and raised hell. They of course apologized, but the next time another part was missing. 

The food is nothing special compared to the prices they charge. Go upstairs to Capital Seafood or go down the street to Cafe Noodle. If you like Chinese BBQ go to the take out restaurant connected to the International Marketplace. They are a fraction of the price and do not try to pull the wool over their customers.Worst place ever!! The service is horrible!! The best thing there is roasted duck if you really want some ducks just do togo. One star is too much for them! Never come back. Oh and they charge $7.50 for one oder of plain noodle.I've been to other Sam woos. This probably the worst one out of all. 
The restaurant: filthy
Food: we ordered duck and pork and wonton noodle soup. Duck and pork were old and dried. I thought I was chewing on papers or rubbers. The ducks were hanging by the window looked like there were hung there, starved to their death for days. Wonton was not edible and the soup was cold probably from frozen wonton. Gross. 
Service: below par. 

Bottom line: we will never come back here again. If you don't believe me, try it and find out for yourself.I've been to this Sam Woo several times in the past and it was alright, but when I went last week, it was NASTY.  The quality has definitely gone way down.  The crab soup was bland.  The beef chow fun was too salty from being drenched in soy sauce.  The fried rice and chow mein was okay but not that good.  We also had a mushroom claypot dish that was actually decent and it was the only dish that was hot.  We had a lot of leftover food and I was not full because I didn't like the food.

This place is dirty and the service is slow.  My teacup had a crack in it which made my tea leak.  Their highchairs were filthy.

This place is ridiculously overpriced.

This place doesn't deserve to be called Sam Woo because they make the chain look bad.

Oh, and it is cash only.This place SUCKS totally overpriced and service is terrible. Went to look around china town and so happen to eat here. Since its location is just right there. What a big mistake should have look at yelp first. Salt and pepper chicken wings has no salt which means bland. BBQ pork yuck. Mongolian beef what a joke. Service the worst ever no check up, no refills, and worst of all gave us kiddie cups. You've got to be kidding me. The highlight CASH only haha. I guess the jokes on us!My family and I went here for dinner a couple nights ago. Here are the reasons for the 1 star:

- The food tastes so-so.
- There were 26 of us and they were going to charge us $1 per person for rice even though we had ordered many (overpriced) entrees. I mean, really?!
- The baby-sized cups for water. I can't tell you how many times the cups had to be refilled because they were mini sized. It was laughable.
- Lastly, we were celebrating our uncle's retirement party and brought a couple cakes. We asked to use their knife. As we were leaving, a lady (hostess? owner?) accused us of taking the knife even though we told her that we had left it on the table. She specifically told one of my cousins that if he didn't hand it to her directly that she would charge us ... this is after we had just spent $300 for our so-so, overpriced dinner.

Never going there again nor recommending it to anyone - should have looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here, especially when there are better places nearby.Don't go here if you aren't Chinese ...they will help everyone else first. We got there and they tried to sit the people behind us first until they said no they were here first. We sat for 10 minutes and watched them seat and serve 3 tables after us until we got up and walked out.Like other people who gave low rating to this place, my experience was somewhat similar.

First of all, how the world could this place charged me a to-go BBQ duck rice for $10.25?!  
You can get better deal in other BBQ joint at Jones ave.  I felt like I was eating garbage, I could only finished half of the food because it did not taste good.

The quality of duck was so-so, very little duck meat and too grease.   To make my experience worst, the service person added too much soy sauce to my rice, to test my sodium intake to a daily new high.   I can't convince myself to come back anytime soon.  Strike One.This place is dirty and the service are bad. They put the tip on the check automatically and we only have 4 people. The food is just so so.CASH ONLY.

They didn't give us water until we flagged the waitress down several times. What's so hard about water? Isn't it almost a norm in restaurant to serve water to the guests whether they ask for it or not?

My friend wanted to order a tofu fried rice. Its not on the menu but since he saw they have some tofu dishes, he thought he could order it. We've been eating out together for years, and everytime he ask for it usually theres no problem. Instead, the waitress look at him like he's dumb and said "I'm sorry we don't have that on the menu. But I could ask the cook to make veggie fried rice if you want." Well why can't you ask the cook to make tofu fried rice? Both are not on the menu! Whats so different between those two? He ended up getting fried rice with egg only. He asked for a fried egg on top of the fried rice and again, the server said he CAN'T. The eggs are blended into the fried rice.
Really.. what's the difference??
At this point my friend was pissed off, so he agreed to anything.

Check came out with gratuity included and original tab with chinese writings on it and no english at all. Since none of us read hanzi, we asked a waitress to translate it, which she did, but she saw one of the dish has wrong price (it was written $9.50 instead of $13.50) so she took the tab without saying anything, added $4 to the total price, gave it back to us, and left. Wow. Just... wow.

Terrible service. Food is not even that good either. There are tons eateries throughout this area that offer better service and better food. Find those places.. SKIP this one.This place was dirty the food was way overpriced and the service was horrible. My wife waited outside at 10:50 waiting for them to open at 11 and when the waiter opened the door at 10:58 my wife entered only to be escorted out saying they were not open yet. She later decided to just try to order something Togo over the phone and they said they don't take orders over the phone. WTH???? When she finally went in to order the girl was pretending she didn't understand what my wife was ordering. This place is dirty, food overpriced, and the staff is rude and stupid.  We definitely won't be back. This place gives Sam Woo a bad name.Do Not eat here!!!! Unless you want to get rip off!!! They charge me $9.95 for a side order of bean sprout. Should be around $2. I will never come back here!!!Just finished a meal here,  almost 10 PM.  Long wait for the food after ordering,  both dishes were very bland (ordered stewed ox over rice,  which was actually stewed offal over rice,  and house chow mein. )  my advice,  don't eat here.If it was at all possible to give this place a zero rating, I would do it without a doubt. Food quality is horrible, portion size is incredibly small, and service is horrible. Came in here thinking it was good bc this place was packed, but don't let that fool you. I was especially pissed at the mandatory tip they stick onto your bill! I brought the bill up to pay and they literally asked for the tip on the spot; so I lied and said I left it on the table. The cashier actually told the waitress to check if it was there! When she said it wasnt, this chick tried hustling me for the tip! My brother and I were so angry that we cussed out the cashier and had a yelling match with her, saying that she had no right to charge me for tip and that the food and service were horrible. She gave up pretty quickly knowing i was completely right. My advice to everyone: you don't have to tip for shitty service.Really bad service . The food is not good . Only ok.  We been waiting for like 30 mins for our food to come .Somehow a lot of people kept recommending us this place (might they get paid to do that?). Ordered shrimp fried rice and another one with shrimp and scallops. The first one had miniature, ridiculous looking shrimp (probably imitation ones) while the second one had a few minced scallops and no shrimp at all. We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same. The waiter also said that their food is authentic Cantonese.
PS: We eat shrimp fried rice at Cantonese places all the time so we know how it supposed to look.I know Chinese restaurants aren't exactly known for their excellent service, but this place is downright rude even by Chinese restaurant standards.  

The waiter just plopped the water pitcher down and quickly walked away.  After that, I was expecting the waiter to tell us that we needed to prepare our own food. Not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.  The only time our waiter forced an unconvincing smile on his face was when it was time to pay the bill.

On the plus side though, the food was pretty good. My family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.

It's too bad the horrible service outweighed the tasty food. Highly unlikely we'll ever dine here again on our next visit to Las Vegas.My foot got really swollen and discolored while I was at Comic Con last week so went to UMC Quick Care just to make sure that it wasn't anything to worry about. When the doctor came in he looked at my foot for a minute and said that it was probably a blood clot and I needed an ultrasound. A few minutes later a nurse comes in telling me to sign a form so I can be transfered to the ER at UMC, WTF? So I asked if that was really neccessary and she said yes so off I went. Got to the ER at about 8:30 pm and didn't leave until 3:40 am! The waiting room wasn't even that full but I was out there for 2 hours before they called me back and then was sent back out again, this happened a few times. I was finally called back and taken for my ultrasound around 12:15 but I didn't even realize that was where I was going till they parked me in the hall outside the ultrasound room, then I had to wait because no one had the paperwork for me. When the ultrasound was done they came and wheeled me to a room and then just left me with no explanation about what was coming next, oh and the guy pushing me said he would go get my husband but he never did, I had to get up and ask a nurse if he could come back since he didn't know what was goin on with me at that point. So got to the room and waited and waited and finally after about an hour a doctor comes in (doesn't tell me his name or anything) and starts asking me what is wrong, hello isn't that on my chart at this point, but ok I go through the story again and he says that it probably isn't a blood clot but he will have to look at the ultrasound and then *poof* he is gone and never to be seen again. After another 1.5 hours I'm really tired and getting really pissed off so I look for a nurse to ask what is going on and when I find one she asks me if the doctor is discharging me!?! How the hell would I know, so I tell her I haven't seen the doctor for 1.5 hours and last I heard he was supposed to be reviewing my ultrasound. She says she will go check with him, yeah you do that, so I go and sit and wait and then another nurse comes in and tells me to sign the discharge paperwork. Ummm so what the hell is going on with my foot, "Oh there's no blood clot but you knew that", so I ask how the hell am I supposed to know that if no one tells me. So fine what is wrong with my foot and what do I do to get it small enough to fit into a shoe again? She literally shoves a prescription for 800mg ibuprofean in my face and says take that and keep it elevated. At this point I am either going to start crying or hitting people so I just take the paper work and leave since it is now 20 to 4am and I have to be at work by 9. 

This is the absolute worst health care experience I have ever had and I just pray that neither I nor any of my loved ones have a true emergency and get sent to this hospital. I can't imagine how someone who really does need emergency care makes it out of this place alive.UMC is terrible at keeping family members informed. I sat in the waiting room for 7 hours total while my husband sat in the ER waiting for doctors to stitch him up. Took hours for a doctor to come in and check him out. Took another couple of hours for doctors to discharge him. If you're looking for immediate help go to another hospital unless you want to sit and wait for hours on end.Went back to Korean Garden Saturday night with some family in town from out of the country and was so disappointed.  My favorite salad was gone and replaced with what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce with tasteless dressing.  The meat was bland.  Plus the service was not up to par.  I doubt we will be going back here and we have been long time customers.Had the Beef Bulgogi box and ordered sides of the kimchi.   WORSE BULGOGI I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Dry and no taste.  VERY VERY VERY Disappointed.  Will never eat here againWhat happened? This place used to be my favorite Korean restaurant whenever I came to Vegas. Here's what we ordered:

Kalbi:  very salty now
Kimchi Stew: okay
Daen Jang Stew: bland/no flavor
Nakji Bok Eum: no flavor
Mandoo Guk: no taste/bland

The waitress told me that the chef changed recently. Get him or her back!!! How can it be this bad?? I will give you another chance just because I have experienced good food here throughout the years but I am hoping that you will improve by the time I come back, please. BTW the soju was quite delicious as always.If you wana stare at the grill with no meat then come try this place out. You'll be eating air for awhile so come prepared. 

Servers are helpful at first then they ignore you. We sat there waiting, trying to get the servers' attention. One of the girls literally looked at us and walked away. Didn't even bother to ask if we needed anything else. Also, we order steam eggs and it only took 3 servers to ask us to finally get it. 

This place has bad service and I will not be coming back. Go to Tofu Hut instead. Even their service is better than this one.Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. 

First, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. 

Second, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. 

I highly, highly recommend against going there.  Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably.I just received the worst service experience in my years of eating at high end steak houses. The food was good overall but I don't need to be disrespected and insulted on top of mediocre service when I'm dropping a grand in your establishment.

We had a group of 8 get together for a post Viva Las Vegas dinner. Please note that while this is a rockabilly convention we all dressed up to the nines for a "classy" dinner experience at the Golden Steer. When we arrived we asked to have separate checks because as with many high end steakhouses, the items are served ala carte. Thus, it makes figuring the bill at the end a nightmare with this many people. The excuse was the computer system can't handle it..and apparently writing it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip. Our group was not loud nor over demanding yet had a lot of trouble getting service in general as others have mentioned in reviews recently. 

As expected, the chaos begins when it comes check time. We get handed one copy of the check and are basically told "you need to figure it out". After lots of asking we finally got multiple copies to try and make sense of the confusing bill. This whole process takes us 40 minutes of struggling with the staff to clarify the bill as if it just too much trouble for them despite the place being less than half full. We ended up missing a show in Vegas we wanted to attend dealing with this fiasco.

As we start paying, the real fun begins. We are told by one of the servers in a very condescending and rude tone "well, maybe they do that at Denny's but we dont do it here" in regards to the poor service with the check. It seemed to be a personal shot based on being from the convention. Also, when asked why we are not being taken care of as is a servers job.. He replies "is it my job?" as if he would be doing as little as possible for the 20 percent tip. The older waiter over hearing the conversation was clearly embarrassed by his colleagues remarks.

Sorry but there are too many other great steak houses in Vegas to deal with lazy and insulting staff. Perhaps he should not have been so judgmental. I work for a Fortune 100 company and like to take clients to dinner. I make a good living and I am highly educated, I dont eat at Denny's thanks.  I don't need this garbage. Guess who isn't taking any clients here anymore?

P.S. Denny's probably has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server. He obviously can't handle this gig.My wife and I went for breakfast the other day. We had been to The Omelet House a few years ago and decided to go again. I am not a big breakfast person so I decided to have the Grilled Ham & Cheese sandwich. My wife ordered one of their six egg omelets. My sandwich was very tasty. I did also enjoy the potatoes that came with it. They are sliced like potato chips, but not cooked to a hard crunch. They are soft and crunchy at the same time. My wife said her omelet was quite tasty as well.

I am sorry to say that in the long run I was not very impressed. When we arrived we waited to be seated a good three to five minutes. The restaurant was only about half full at the time. Once seated we also had to wait to have anyone come by and get our drink order. That was almost ten minutes. I don't know what kind of tea they serve, but my tea had a strange taste to it. My wife ordered sourdough toast with her omelet. When it arrived I was drenched in margarine to the point she had to send it back and ask for it dry. My sandwich, even though tasty, was priced way too high. The slices of bread were not very big, the ham was not very thick and the cost was close to eight dollars.

I have to say that our server was friendly and did the best she could. The food was pretty good but overpriced. All in all it is just an ok place to go. I can't say about the other locations. I ate at the Charleston location. Maybe the others are better.Not only was the food too greasy but they wouldn't accept our Entertainment coupon because they said it was a holiday which wasn't true. This was a Sunday, the day before Veteran's Day. I thought the point of such coupons was to build a customer base, not piss people off by making up weird rules and then quibbling about them. Never again Omelet House! Never again!A horrible union who only cares about you if you speak no English and listen to everything they tell you. HorribleWe decided to book Presidential for Valentines' day. The pickup from the airport was on time and the driver was nice and courteous.  However,  on the day we are going back to airport, the driver/company messed up the time and went to the wrong hotel.  When I called them later they said they already sent the driver and that I did not call to confirm the time so there's nothing they can do other than file a dispute or send a new driver which they will charge me for.  

Moreover, the number they have puts you on hold forever then the person who picks it up doesn't work for presidential and had to transfer you.... 

overall, the limo is nice, if you get a chance to be in it...

(btw, in the end we decided to file for dispute and just took a cab back)I recently had a very bad experience with this company.  

First, the driver I ordered for this past Friday did not meet me at baggage claim upon arrival in Vegas.  I called company HQ and they tried to reach him to figure out what he was doing, but they couldn't get through to him.  They were polite and apologetic that I had to wait, but I had to wait nonetheless.  Finally he arrived, but it was 20 minutes late.

Second, I just found out that somebody in Las Vegas (I live in SF) tried to buy $1600 in jewelry on my card.  That was after a $1.50 charge earlier in the day (I'm told this is a common way to "test" a stolen card number).  

What does this fraudulent charge have to do with Presidential Limo?

Here are the facts:
--The card with the fraudulent charge is a backup card that I rarely use.
--I only use it when I can't find my other primary credit cards.
--On the day I ordered the limo last week, I had misplaced my wallet, so I used my backup card.
--I did not use that card for anything else in or around Las Vegas.
--Yet I was just called by my bank and informed of the $1600 purchase today in Vegas, even though I got back to SF yesterday.
--Clearly, someone stole my credit card number.We were booked with Presidential as a shuttle to the Exotics Racing experience at the LV Speedway.  We were never told the rate and they arbitrarily chose a pickup time 3 &1/2 hours later without informing us, leaving us stuck at the track waiting for more than an hour, even though they had limos available and leaving for the Strip with room in them before that.   Epic Fail, guys.First if there is a way to give zero stars, I would give it. 

I took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show. Shame on me for not reading the reviews!

Waiter: The waiter, like others reported on their reviews, was the owner. He was rude, impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service. My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate. The first time I heard of such foolish charge.  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests, and we told him that we can pass things down to him. He got upset and made a snappy remark. 

Food:  The food was about average.  Most of us ordered the same dish, and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way. We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention. 

All and all the experience was horrible, and I do t recommend this to anyone.Disgusting food dirty food nasty people habib the owner is very cheap and charge extra for the food don't come here you get treated like crap wait 2 hours for nothing and get overcharged DO NOT COME HERE FAKE PERSIAN CUSINE THIS PLACE IS AN EMBARESSMENTThere was a lot of food, but it was absolutely rancid. The environment was hideous not to mention the "clean" dishes still had food on them! The servers hardly spoke English and where very rude. I wouldn't suggest this to my worst enemy. You're better off eating at the Burger King right next door.Out here for a business trip, found this place around during lunch. Huge mistake! Never go there! The food was not good and to top it off my fry chicken was hairy! It had hair all over! No manager was available and the girl in charge did not care. She just said (in her Chinese accent) "Oh that's normal, we get those from time to time cuz  we buy our chicken it comes like that." What?! Not to mention she made me pay full price! I paid and left! Never again!My friend and I were walk-ins on a Friday afternoon.  There were 3 girls (won't call them manicurists or technicians) who did not seem to know what they were doing.  We had the mani/pedi special for $32.  The woman who worked on me did not speak or understand English.  She worked so quickly, both mani and pedi were complete in 35 minutes.  She was so fast cutting cuticles that she actually cut me 2 times that drew blood - she worked like her cuticle clippers were on fire.  

My nails started chipping on Saturday afternoon -  unreal!  We will never go back.  There was an air of rudeness in the place, like we were bothering them.  

STAY AWAY!i should have read the reviews before i came here .... there was a lady in the chair when i showed up, when i was done she was still in the pedi chair i felt rushed and pushed thru ... i'll never go backLast time I ate at Roberto's was over a year ago, had the carne asada burrito and threw up half way eating it.Brutal!  Went here on the advice of someone working at a nearby business and was absolutely floored at how bad it was.  Ordered iced tea and it tasted like it was made from water filtered through nougat!  Yuck!  My friends meal looked very lackluster.  He said the meat was fine, but nothing special.  I had some long noodles with bulgogi.  I normally love this dish, but something was really off with this.  My friend finished, we paid the bill and left.  Ended up at Los Tacos next door and was thrilled I had discovered my new favorite taco stand.  Island Style came through with that at least.Bad service. The Guy that runs the store is a ass hole. They gave me one discounted price over the phone and when I got there the boss said no. Save your money and shop some where else.Totally ignorant . And I speak of the person that is currently working there . All I did was ask for a pack of cigarettes and begins to talk smack to me about California and some random shit. The eff??This has to be the worst Mexican food in Las Vegas!!!  I ordered the Chimichanga with Chili Colorado.  It was 95% canned refried beans and 5% meat.  It was topped with 1 black olive and a gigantic glob of sour cream, making it a soggy mess.  The chips were like styrofoam, and the salsa tasted like something from the generic section of Walmart.  The best part of the meal was the ice water.  The slop they serve at Taco Bell and Robertos is far superior to this place.  Other reviews talk about the Margaritas- if I had had enough of these, I might not care about the food here.  The only positive was the waitress, who was very nice and attentive.I went here to have my nails done because they had good reviews on yelp. I received the worst nail fill I ever had. I had bubbles in the gel, instead of redoing the gel they file my nails leaving them ruff and not smooth. I had my nails done at 5:00 the previous day. By 11:00 am the next day my nail broke. It was not even 24 hours. I went back to have them replaced and they had the gull to charge me $5.00 for their mistake. I will never go back there again. This is the worst nail salon I have been. Never, Never, Never again!!!!!!!!This is purely for the popcorn chicken. 

It's HORRIBLE! I've never has such bad popcorn chicken in my life. The order was not even a full order when we got it. The bag was less than half filled. Our order had basil with the full stems...they're definitely not shaisty with the basil but the chicken....how bad could something be made?? There was no batter. It seem like naked fake chicken fried. Whatever you do, never order popcorn chicken there. I can't speak for other things....not a fan. 

They messed up on 3 of our separate orders; not blending it, boba when asked for jelly, and a completely different flavor. Were pretty veteran boba drinkers so we know what we want and we know how to order it so it was a big surprise that ALL THREE of our orders were incorrect.

We let the cashier know and asked if we could have simple adjustments but she looked confused and said no. Not even just to pop the unblended one into the blender (although after i understood due to health and sanitation reasons)

Bad customer service or bad active listening skills, Volcano Tea House did not do us well..What happened?

I always find my way here when I go to Vegas but this last trip there was awful.  I think that was a new owner I saw and the tea tasted bland and light?  Are they watering down the tea or reusing tea leaves?  I don't know what happened but it was light and not like other volcano tea shops that's for sure.  I had to hop over next door to tea station to right this wrong. At last.... Tea station was able to deliver where volcano failed.I stopped in today with a brand new SEIKO SBDC007 Shogun (Japanese Domestic Market) to have the bracelet adjusted. I'd lost 2 pins and they charged me $10 a piece for those, which I thought was outrageous, but I can deal with that.

What really ticked me off is the fact that I get home and notice a nick in the left lower lug on a brand new titanium watch that was shipped from Japan only 2 days ago!!! It would've been nice of them to let me know that at the store, but then they'd be admitting to being culpable for their negligence.

Outrageous prices and incompetent watch repair guys who F'ed up an expensive, rare titanium watch that is no longer produced. Picture attached.Attention folks! 

Do you like hard, flavorless, uncooked boxed brown rice that taste like it was made weeks prior? 

Do you like ordering a chicken dish and it is mostly vegetables? 

Yeah! Awesome, then you will love this place then if you answered yes to the following questions! 

If half of your taste buds are in operation then please AVOID this atrocity at ALL cost! 

The only thing that are ok is their crab Rangoon's, other than that go take a big chunky dump in a bag and dig in, you would love that more than any entree from this place! 

Waste of money! Bad Bad Bad food! I feel ripped off! $13 bucks down the drain on garbage!


Don't do it! Please...don't don't do it!MMMM expecting greatness, however I was very surprised at the overall experience from this place. We came in here and there were alot of people waiting to sit down (20 min wait) which is usually a good sign. We waited almost exactly 20 min for our table. Our server was Jacelyn. She took our drink order and we were on our way into our Blueberry hill experience. My 5 year old was quick to point out how dirty her silverware was. They must have just missed this batch as there was some black and  brown left over crusted on her knife and fork. We gave Jacely our order as I ordered the strawberry pancakes because the picture on the menu looked fabulous. My girl got the meatlovers skillet, my daughters the strawberry french toast and happy face pancakes. The order took about 13 min to come to our table. That is when the fun began. We gave Jacely our entire order the first time around. She forgot about half of it. Missing eggs, toast, no whipped creame, no ketchup, no powdered sugar. I noticed i had only 3 pancakes when the picture clearly showed 4 and was smothered with strawberry sauce and whipped creame. Mine had non of this. Just a little dribble of sauce and a ice creame scoop of butter. I thought, well maybe they are busy, however this is supposed to be a top line breakfast joint. They should know that weekend business would be extreme so why the mess up. Anyway I ate about half my breakfast before our server came back with the whipped creame, forgot the everything else. Had to tell her again what was missed as she walked away paying attention to other people, no biggie. She returned with no hash browns and no sugar. my daughter wont touch her french toast without powered sugar and again had to ask Jacelyn for the rest of our order. I never got my hash browns and just figured she was real busy and forgot. That wasnt the kicker, the people next too me ordered the same strawberry pancake dish as mine and hers was entirely different. 1 more pancake, tons of strawberry dressing, whipped cream on top as i didnt have any at all as Jacelyn forgot our request. I asked the lady what she had ordered, same as mine, i thought WTF....Jacelyn never came back to check our drinks so at this point i am pretty irritated. Since my breakfast was not that good to begin with, I tried my daughters french toast. she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal. I was like WTF again. I took a bite and instantly bit down on something hard as a rock. I spit it out and my daughters french toast had tons of uncooked rice in her meal. At this point I was like f this place. We got our check and i couldnt leave fast enough. The service was terrible. I thought if this supposed to be top notch breakfast place they must have missed the hiring procedure with Jocelyn as she squeaked by and has a job here. At hash house a go go i am sure she would be fired on the spot as they would not accept the type of service Jacelyn puts out. Didnt want to even deal with the drama of talking to a manager at this point, so my advice dont believe the hype. Find a secluded Dennys as you will get an overall better product than Blueberry Hill Restaurant. VERY DISSAPPOINTED.If you decide to eat at a Jack in the Box in the Sahara and Decatur area, quadruple check your order before you step off the premises (for to go orders). 

They CAN NOT manage to get my order right, even though I eat there 2+ times a week. Either forgetting to include all of the tacos that we order, or just decide to give you whatever sandwiches they want to provide for you.

Today, for instance, I was able to get the last of the forgotten items from my last visit, before leaving, I looked through the bag and verified the proper number of items. I get back to work, divvy up the food and notice that instead of giving me one each of the 3 sandwiches that were ordered, they gave me two of one, and one of another.

They decided not to bother answering the phone this time, so I guess it is time to go to corporate to try and get this rectified.Will never see your money.DONT GO DONT GO DONT GO.....my girlfriend and I have been to the sunset rd one 4 times over the last few months.  There is always a problem.  !st time we ordered the 2 for $20.00 and each had a drink.. our bill was over $60.  When we asked the waitress she said "ohhhhhhhh i rang it in as a regular order".  This has happened twice.  Come on I wasnt born yesterday.  They are scamming so if you dont look over your bill your paying full price.  Then just this Saturday night 8/11/2012 we saw a 2 for $10 comercial and figured hey 10 bucks lets give it one more shot..  We were seated and given our menu's but no 2 for 10- menu when i asked for it they said they dont have the 2 for 10 anymore.  I said i just saw the commercial and its on your website.  She said we dont have that she then said they had a 3 for 20.  I looked over the 3 menu's they hand you and no 3 for 20 so i had to call her over and ask for it.  I then asked why isnt the 3 for 20 menu included with all these others. get this response " ohhh if you dont ask for it we dont give it to you" . I then asked for a manager and she dismissively informed me that on any specials if you dont know about it and ask for it they dont tell you about it..  Are you kidding me.  Needless to say we didnt ordered and i just paid for the drinks and left.  Also this place has gone down hill in the clean dept.  Floors dirty tables not cleaned.  What a joke I will never eat at a fridays again.  When we asked the manager for the corporate number we had to wait 10 mins for it and she doesnt even include her name on it we had to ask. SCAM SCAM SCAM SHADY PLACE.  AGAIN DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HEREMy family and I have eaten at various TGIF's and the service I had tonight at this location was the WORST restaurant experience ever! I'm honestly fuming inside. My fiancé has worked in a restaurant for over 15 years and we're usually very understanding and forgiving, but tonight was unbelievable. There were sooo many things that went wrong and the manager actually refused to see us until we insisted to speak to her or our party of 16 was going to walk out on the bill. I will be calling the GM tomorrow.What happened to this place? I guess coming in at 6pm on a Saturday and seeing it completely dead should be a sign. For starters, the food and drink prices seem ridiculously high from what I remember. The staff is alright, our waiter was pretty friendly this time around but with as slow as it was, it took way too long for our food to come out.

I went with a new item they had on the menu...Korean Steak Tacos. For $10, I expected a lot more. The tacos were small and had barely any meat on them, the tortillas were stale and I'm pretty sure the greens topping them were expired. My wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay. They drench the wings in sauce so they are super soggy when they come out. About the only thing we liked were the pretzel sticks which I'm guessing are a frozen thing so not too hard to get right anyway.

The food and service might deserve 2-3 stars but the restaurant doesn't for letting a particular "balloon man" wander around. I posted a picture of the guy so if you see him, make sure to say no thanks on the balloon animals. I don't get mad easily and joke around quite a bit, but this dude was a complete d-bag. He was making inappropriate jokes, being rude and just acting like a complete jackass in front of my family, including my 4 year old who he was making the balloon for. Had I not been with family, there would have been a problem with the way this guy was acting. I won't be coming back to this particular TGI Friday's anytime soon, if ever, just because of him.We came here for breakfast as hubby wanted salty soy ($1.95). Lil guy wanted cong you bing ($2.95). We also ordered a dish called husband and wife beef slices ($5.95) which is deceiving since it's beef and tendon slices in a spicy sauce and not just beef on its own. Well the flavor of this dish was ok but not spicy enough and not nearly enough of the Sichuan peppercorns. Salty soy wasn't bad but not not as flavorful as it could've been. But the worse part of all was the cong you bing. OMG it was SO greasy and just disgusting. The service was also awful. The servers' lack of enthusiasm just made me want to get out of there ASAP.First strike: We order the chinese donut, and 2 main dishes (vegetable and beef)
The beef comes out first so we dive right in because we were starving.  About halfway through we ask our server when our other dish will be coming out.  After about 5 minutes she comes back and says "we ran out of green beans, do you want to order another dish"  Um....shouldn't you have checked this when you first put our order in the kitchen?  We decided not to get the vegetable dish and just finish our meal.

Second strike:  They put extra charges on our bill.  They charged us for 3 chinese donut when we only ordered one, and they kept the vegetable dish on the bill.

Third strike:  On the final check that was handed to me, the total had gratuity included.  Really?  Mandatory gratuity for a party of 2?  Whatever.  I gave them my card and when it came back to me for my signature, it said in BIG BOLD LETTERS "PRE TIP AMOUNT".
First off, this is the first place that I've been to where they actually had "PRE TIP AMOUNT" in bold caps.  It's like they were trying to draw attention to it.
Secondly, W T F?  You include a mandatory gratuity that wasn't mentioned ANYWHERE on the menu, and now you try to get tipped twice by saying the FINAL amount w/ gratuity is the pre-tip amount???
Shady shady.  I won't be coming back here ever again. And if you read this and still end up going, double check your bill.  Who knows how much extra cash this place managed to squeeze out of unsuspecting patrons.

Another thing I remembered, they give you white rice without asking if you want it or not, and then they charge you for it.Food was bad.  Charges for rice.  Service was meh.  Ordered fried chicken wings.  It came out soggy, nasty, and bloody--was utterly disgusting.  Would not recommend, ever...Yuck!!! This place does not deserve a 1 star at all... I wish I can give it 0. The food was absolutely horrible.

The service was average, a little slow for a restaurant that is not busy, the waitress seemed side-tracked.

The only reason why we came here was because Mom said when she came around 2007 it was pretty good, but NOW WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK. The food was not worth $75+, what a rip off.Crappy food, waiters rush everything everyone. And they add tips in your bill regardless how you like the service. The worst part is they use 永和豆漿brand to fool the unknowings. Stay awayThis place is OK. The portions are tiny for the price and it's more Americanized than the other restaurants in town.We went for Christmas eve dinner ( as Jews often do!) looking for a straight forward chinese food meal. Ordered standard fare, pot stickers, wonton soup, egg foo young, mongolian beef... the worst, brown gravy, cornstarchy, old oil tasting, salty, gooy , single note tasting chinese food I have had in years... if this wins all these banners for the best in las  vegas, they must have fed the LVRJ for free for years.
Yuck!me and my friends wanted to share two pots of hot milk tea. When we got them they were in two big bowls with spoons. We asked for cups and they said that each cup would cost an extra $1....seriously? We are paying for tea and we can't have cups to drink them?? This store obviously cares more about ripping me off than actually making me a happy customer...never coming here for boba again! (yes, the boba was good but there's plenty of other places in lv to get boba, and those places give you cups)I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, "hey, let's go to tea station!" Icy juicy will provide a much better service.I made a Yelp account just so I could review this place and warn other people how HORRIBLE this place is. First of all, the drinks tasted like they were made with powder. Gross. Second, the boba was so hard I couldn't eat them. Also, when we ordered, we specifically said "To Go" but they gave us the glass cups instead. So when we clarified the second time it was to go, they gave us plastic cups and told us to pour it out ourselves. Also, after seating us, and after being seated for about fifteen minutes, the waiter then told us to get up and move down because he needed to seat other guests. I was tired of the lousy customer service so we got up to pay, and we stood in front of the register for a good ten minutes while the waiters just kept walking past us. One of them even bumped into me. NEVER EVER EVER coming back here. It is way over priced. Spent $50 for the WORST customer service experience I've ever had. That's $50 I'm never going to get back. If I could, I would give this place no stars at all. They are so rude. DO NOT COME HERE! Go to Icy Juicy down the street, it is much much better. This place is ridiculous.I don't like this one the only thing I like bout it is the selecton other then that DON"t go here it stinks like rotten old fish and meat like they don't take care it. It's super old looking like from 1940 or something REMODEL plase u make all that money off the poor people in the nieghborhood I'm poor too. The ceiling looks like crap like there been several water leaks. And the frozen area had brown stuff in the back of the cooler gross. It's to bad Idon't have vehicle other wise  i would go somewhere else. I jus dont buy meat here or anything that is not sealed or in a can.I am a "ghost" meaning I have no real established credit. I am a first time buyer. These are the numbers in comparison with AutoNation Honda East and Carmax.

The numbers:
AutoNation Honda East.
Car: Honda Accord
Year: 2007
Mileage: 80K
Down payment: $3,000
APR: 28%
Monthly payment: $438

Carmax.
Car: Volkswagen Jetta
Year: 2013
Mileage: 30k
Down payment: $3,500
APR: 12%
Monthly payment: $358

Now looking at the numbers you may think that the reason the APR is lower for Carmax is the extra $500 down payment, but the best Honda later offered us 15% APR with $4,500 down.

The story is we took the 2007 Honda Accord with the 28% APR. We were going to pay the additional $1,500 within 28 days to get a lower APR. The day we took the Honda it was told to us that it was in need of a new starter. They installed a new starter before we left the lot. The very next day the car would not start. We were stranded and called Honda. They sent a tow truck. It took two hours for them to get there when we only 14 minutes from Honda (according to google maps). Not only did they take long, they did not send a car for us. We had to find a ride back to the dealership.

We asked for a refund. They came up with new numbers. Still the best they could do was 15% APR with a co-signer. I had already made up my mind I wanted a refund. At first they asked if we had our debit cards used in the down payment for the refund. Then we were told that they would cut is a check but it would take 2 days to go through corporate. We said okay and went to Carmax. After falling in love with the 2013 Jetta, we could not get it because we did not have our refund. Carmax held the car for is for 3 days. We went to Honda on the 2nd day and expected our check. Instead they swiped our debit cards. Unfortunately this meant it would take the banks anywhere from 3-7 business days to show back up in our bank account. We were stuck without a car until the money went through. We called and asked Honda to please cut us a check so we can get our car but they said they couldn't.
Thank god a family member loaned us the money so we could get the Jetta. I would recommend the Carmax experience over Honda/AutoNation to anyone.Terrible - don't bother

I drove out to visit this place based on the good reviews on Urban Spoon. I was harassed by 2 separate guys while getting out of my car - asking for money. I felt very unsafe here. It was 1pm on a Monday! I looked in and noticed that the actual drugstore had closed and the building was empty. Tiffany's was still open though. I went inside and found one customer sitting at the counter and another standing waiting for a take out order. There was a man cooking at the grill and a woman behind the counter. As I walked in, the woman behind the counter looked at me then turned around and faced the grill man. She stood there staring at him while he was cooking for over 3 minutes and completely ignored me as I was standing at the counter. I said, "excuse me" and was ignored still. After looking at the cleanliness of this place (which was quite disgusting) and after being rudely ignored purposely, I decided to leave and never come back! I was astonished at how rude the woman was. If they have good food, I will never know as the service is deplorable and not worth the time. What a shame.Ok.

Let me just start out by saying that this is a great Mexican Food Restaurant.

If you loathe Mexican food.

Best thing about eating lunch here? It was out of me less than two hours later!

Explosively.

Really. I swear.

My bud had a 2 for 1 coupon and asked me to join him to talk biz ,so, being cheap, fat and hungry, I said, "sure'. I knew where the place was ( who hasn't bought street drugs at some point in their lives? Don't judge me!) and made it there only to enter 1981 Mexico. The "decor" is barely that. Some frescoes of someone's idea of Mexico could have used a Silkwood shower and the tables looked like ,well, nothing.

The first bad sign? Stale, tasteless chips and some sort of salsa juice. WTF? I mean this set up was so bad even my friend (who will eat anything.) only finished 1/4 of them.

The menu is very typical White suburbia version of Mexican "Combinacciones Platos". I was actually in the mood for that. It's like you know it's not real Mexican food but you love it anyway. 

And then I made a mistake that would cause our waitress, Surlyrella, to decide that she and I were NOT going to be Freunden. 

Not.

"You know what? I'll have a cheese taco as well as my Enchiladas", I gamely said to the looming rock of hate. "CHEESE TACO?', she hissed. 

We stared at each other like two mean Wildebeest about to go all Wild Kingdom on each other. Being Gay, I was not about to back down.

"It's a TACO WITH CHEESE", I looked her gaze right back at her now beady steely eyes.

"Hmph", she shot back in a way that said, "screw you and your mother for letting you down the birth canal!"

So.

The "food" came.

As did the next twenty minutes of my choking down some of the blandest globs of cheese, rice and beans that I have endured since Swanson decided to take on the Mexican TV tray market. 

It came, but it didn't went fast enough for me.

Fast forward to me back at work breaking my cardinal rule, "No number 2 at the office!' 

Explosively.

Oh yeah. That cheese taco? A hard shell with some cheese shoved in with that nasty from the bag shredded lettuce you get on clearance at Food For Less. Despicable.

I hate this place and strongly suggest you eat at , well, anywhere other than here.The worst customer service/experience ever!!! First of all, I called to reserve a chapel. I was put on hold for 35 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone and was inquiring about the different packages, I got a frustrated "you know we are really busy. You need to call back in 2 hours when we are better staffed.." Ok... So I called the next day and spoke to someone a little more pleasant. I booked an appointment and paid for a photographer, video and Elvis. They asked me if this was a marriage or vow renewal. I said marriage. "Great! Show up 15 minutes before your reservation." We arrived with our 30 guests and were told we needed a marriage license. We had to go to the courthouse first. WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL US THIS?!?! We ran to the courthouse and back to the chapel. 

After we checked in (again) we were being escorted to the chapel. A couple pulled up in the drive thru. The woman up front told our minister to do their wedding first and kept all of our guests waiting outside in the 106 degree Vegas heat for 20 minutes while the drive up wedding was being conducted. They refused to open the chapel doors without the minister so we stood outside melting in the heat. I asked if we could have water or something since it was so got and we were waiting outside. We would have gladly paid for it. They said there is a vending machine down the street we could try... 

Then, they refused to let our guests take photos of the ceremony but they didn't have a photographer!!!!!! The photographer only takes photos after the wedding. It was seriously the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. No pictures of the ceremony!!!! Ugh. I'm so glad my guests are rule breakers and snapped a few anyway even though the staff was seriously yelling at my guests during the ceremony. 

Please save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. This place is the absolute worst. ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!!!Can't even believe I am giving it 1 star. Service was horrible at best. We received our food and it was cold. You could tell that the food was frozen and made hours prior and just thrown on a plate when ordered. While we were there 6 different waiters/waitresses walked by and nobody offered to refill our drinks. When our waiter finally came by to pick up our plates and I told him that my food was cold. He offered to remake my meal however everybody else was done and we were ready to leave. He then hands us our bill and charges us for the meal. While we were sitting there we could see the food prep area and we watched someone put a burger in the microwave prior to serving. Clearly my meal did not make it to the microwave step!

When leaving we asked to speak with the manager. She came by and was very rude and argumentative. According to her chef the food was never cold. She also stated that she personally waited our table and ordered us extra drinks, which was a lie. Her next excuse for the horrible service was that she was dealing with one of the hotel towers being out of power. I finally got her to comp our meal and she said I would have the refund in a few days. She also refused to provide me a receipt. End up going to hotel management for this and other issues(different review) and got 1 night of our stay comp. 

Would not recommend to anybody!Both website and voicemail state they're open from 8 am to midnight, but when we get there at 8:15 am the RUDE security guard says they're open at 9 am. We told him they should change their voicemail and he looks at us again and says coldly, 9 am. Never going back here.Service at this Denny's was dismal. After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am, the manager didn't even apologize for the food coming late.

Food was mediocre.

Location was pretty sketchy.

Only go to this location if your desperate.What a sh*t hole... Obviously no one here has ever been to Cuba or at the least, visited Miami... The food is so nasty, the prices are unbelievable.  Why would a croqueta be $3.00?  Who knows, who cares...People from Vegas hear this:  This is not authentic Cuban trust me I am from Miami with Cuban parents.This store focuses on store policies than customer service.I absolutley hate this place.  Filthy, overpriced, and smells like a mix of ass and sweat.  The cover is about $30, then there's a two drink minimum.  Each watered down drink is like $15.  This review is for upstairs, the penis floor.

Bring lots of money if you want the guys to be nice to you.  You have been warned!  If a guy starts dancing on you and you tell him to get off and refuse to pay him (hey, no one asked his scrawny ass to come over to us), they cop a MAJOR attitude.  Then that one stripper you that you told to get the hell off of you goes and tells everyone else that your a cheap bitch and to not go anywhere near you and your crew.  At this point, party's over.

This an absolutley true story, it happened a few years ago at my girl's bachelorette party.  I'm going to a bachelorette party in Vegas this weekend, and guess where the bride-to-be wants to go... OG.  I'm so pissed...after dinner at bradley ogden (inside caesars palace), we head out for bachelorette night #2.  first stop......olympic garden.  the bride's sister very wisely knows to not ask for a cab since apparently they make a commission on taking people there, so she asks the guy at the caesars valet area for a limo.  the limo driver tries to charge us, but she tells him she knows there's no fee.  interesting.  i knew none of this.

i have never been to a strip club.  and i don't think i will ever go back.  it's just not my type of fun.  the minute we got there, i wanted to leave...and that was even after paying the $30 cash only cover.  not wanting to be a party pooper, i sat at the table behind the stage with two other gals who didn't want to be there, while the other 5 gals had front row seats at the stage.    

along with your cover, there was a 2 drink minimum.  the minute you sit down, half nekkid men come up to you, put their hand on your back....all the way down to your booty, and try to get you to buy a lap dance for your friend.  this happened every 5-10 minutes.  we kept pointing to the bride's sister saying "go ask her...she's in charge".

the male dancers are upstairs, while the female dancers are on the first floor.  i will admit, there were some good looking men with rock hard abs there.  a couple of them even knew how to dance.  all of our gals got a lap dance ($20) except 2 of us (which we were perfectly okay with).  the bride got about 4 or 5, including one on stage with two hand-picked guys ($45).  i'm glad the gals had a good time, but i was even happier when we left.  the whole place just made me uncomfortable.  (go ahead, call me a prude....i'm okay with that.)   

oh, and the first thing you notice when you enter isn't the nekkidness...it's the smell.  the smell of a really old building, really old cigarette residue, and cheap perfume, all mixed together.  yes, it's vegas, so it's gonna smell like that everywhere, but no, olympic garden was WAY worse.ok. beware of the "after-service" as i'd like to call it. it's the kind of service that you get after you've already spent all your money inside a bar/club/restaurant/etc. this place is the worst at it. 

8 of us came here saturday night, as part of my cousin's bachelorette getaway in vegas. we paid for the limo/cover package. limo ride from the hotel to OG, and when we arrived, we were treated in a so-so manner. but we didn't really mind at that time. the moment we were shown to our table, hoards of men started invading our table and pushing us to buy each other lap dances. when i say pushing, i mean almost forcing you, literally won't let go of your hand until you agree to a lap dance or buy someone else a lap dance. my cousins just wanted to go all out and we knew this was all good fun so all of us got lap dances and we paid an extra $35 for the bachelorette to be taken to the stage and get another lap dance there. so i guess that was fun. our package also included $240 worth of alcohol from the bar (which didn't really amount to much because their drinks are so overpriced).  

ok now the bad part. so after all the lap dances and drinking that we got from that $240 tab, we decided there wasn't really much else to do but leave. so we did. our package said that the limo would be taking us back to the hotel, and everybody else at the front desk and the guy who was in charge of the front door said we should just wait for our driver. so we waited, 90degrees in vegas last saturday night, and waited, and waited. until my cousins decided to call the limo driver himself and ask him what's taking too long. he said he's on his way back but not for us. he basically said we won't be getting limo service back to the hotel. WTF! so yeah, whatever right. why couldn't they just have said that there won't be a limo service back, we wouldn't have waited in that heat! and the front door guy just looked like he didn't really care at all. none of them would care for you since you already spent money there. really really bad customer service. if you can find another strip-club, then they probably will be way better than this joint. 

one tip: you can just rent out your own limo service and not get it as a package with OG to avoid this. we certainly learned our lesson.Worst strip club for your money.  $66 to get in for me and my wife on a Sunday night.  Recommended by cab driver and valet at NY NY so we assumed it was good.  BAD assumption.  90% of girls have guts.  Definitely a third rate strip club.  Do not waste 1 dollar here.  Go to Spearmint Rhino!We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.  

The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location.

The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not. 

 After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.Thought I was getting a great deal on a new freezer. Turns out the manufacturer had gone out of business. Everyone who has worked on it says same thing. It is poorly made, hard to find schematics on it, and it breaks every 3-6 months. Needless to say it wasn't a great deal for me. I'm sure they're happy it's off the showroom floor though. My purchases will go back to Clark county or AAA.beverages were good, food was ice cold, service was blehh. server never came back with change and we only gave her twenties.. walked out yelling, "THANK U, U CAN KEEP THE CHANGE!" my nice way of being a bitch. ha. never going back, unless someone else is paying. I'd rather take my chances with Florida Cafe.first of all, for being #1 on this lis,t it shouldn't be. Service was poor. Waitress had attitude and seemed to be upset the entire time. Not once did she crack a smile. The pan con lechon that we ordered was very dry and it had cheese! An original Pan con lechon is simply pork, bread and mojo. NO CHEESE! Why do they put cheese on an original cuban sandwich like pan con lechon??? The croquetas were re-heated and old. The place was very hot and no air. The plaque from Zagat and best of Las Vegas should be removed! Not to mention those were from back in 2007!!! Chef Ramsey would be applled!! 
Pass this place up and head somewhere else!Horrible  unethical this company is by far the worst service Center ever ! I've been dealing with this company for 15 years it also came with my home when I purchased it 15 years ago . Every year for the last 15 years the AC unit has went out. This year I must say it was the worst the unit has went out 6 times within the last 6 weeks I've seen five different technician and I have gotten 20 different stories. The three ladies that work and take the calls are horrible insensitive and don't care because they're able to go home to their homes with a AC. I asked Lulu one of the ladies that answers the  phone why won't they replace the unit after 15yrs She stated as long as its able to be repaired they will not! Well today is Friday I haven't had air in 4 days I've seen 3 different techs this week finally after All of this unnecessary drama he states he can't fix it! I knew that and im no AC tech I most definitely will be looking for another company and my First question will be who handles your service calls!So we show up here to get something to eat it was nine in the morning door was locked no problem will ring the bell the buzzer to get in ring ring ring ring no answer ring ring ring ring no answer so after waiting a few minutes ring ring ring then the bartender comes on the intercom to say you guys will not be getting n ringing the buzzer like that or reply was like what? We've been sitting here for over 5 minutes is what I said she said no you haven't I been watching you guys so the question is why are you watching this instead of allowing us to come in to eat breakfast definitely bad customer service this bartender should be firedGood burritos. But I've had betterRIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: "Magazines 29 cents", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that's their system. Won't be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy.I hate these people. (at least in the office)  They cannot find their way out of a paper bag to save their life, in the billing dept.  They can't set up autopay, (really?  In 2012?)and then they don't send out notices for the future payments.  Then, the lady told me that my credit card didn't go through so she needed a second card.  I gave it to her, and then got a phone call later that afternoon that they were refunding the first card because the payment went through on both cards.  Today I get a call that I still owe for the second and third installments.  Get a clue peoplei was convinced that this was my "go to place" for my diamond needs. little did i know they took advantage of me when i was in. they knew i had conducted business there in the past and i was upgrading my pinky ring, they took in my pinky ring valued (which i paid $1400 for) charged me another $1500 for a ring that is only .60 of a carrot!!!! i did not know too much about diamonds etc. and barry and jacks son(the owner) took full advantage of me!! boy, do i feel stupid paying close to $3000 for 0.60 of a carrot!! this place is a rip off!! terrible!! do not trust these guys!! please look elsewhere!! we were just about to purchase more rings ( wedding rings ) and again,,,... they tried over charging us!!! i will stop sending guests there and please do yourself a favor and shop elsewhere!! this is not the business i would recommend to anyone. !!stay away!! -jeffrey frischmannHorrible and dishonest jewelry store!! Went in with my fiancé to get a quote on a custom engagement ring setting (we already had the center stone) and we dealt with Barry. He was very friendly and got us a quote based on pictures of a setting I loved, it was 3500$. So a week later I emailed him to say that I was ready to move forward and we had bought some of the side diamonds to add into the setting and I wanted an updated quote. Barry emailed me a quote of MORE than DOUBLE the original price!! With less diamonds they would need to provide how does this make sense? Total scammers and dishonest! Oh and I did have quotes done by other custom jewelers and they were all between 3 and 4 thousand... BEWARE!!!!My Sister got married here. I helped her with lots of the wedding planning because I live here in Las Vegas and she is in Ca. Let me start off with the nice things about this place... It's pretty inside, very well kept up and the ceremony ended up to be nice. The bad......... My Sister planned her wedding and they ended up over booking and had no intent to even let her know. All of her guest were coming from California. She had all the paperwork set for her chosen date and PAID a deposit. I called in to make a final desicion on the flowers and to let them know how big the party was, then the wedding planner told me ok we will see you guys on this new date.... I said "no the wedding is not then whats going on?" she said oh well it looks like it was overbooked so we had to move you to a different date. The original wedding planner didnt even want to get on the phone to explain what the hell was going on. She had someone else handle the job for her. Our invitations were already sent out so they suggested that WE EMAIL our guest about the new wedding date! REALLY??? (that's just wrong) Then she said either we are going to either choose the new date (wich was on a FRIDAY, not Saturday like we planned) or just get our money back and find a new place to get married at. After I complained and let them know that I would call each and every news station and write a complaint on each and every review website if they didnt work with me. FINALLY they allowed us to keep the original date. We just had to move the wedding to an hour ahead.This place acts like the monopoly it is.

TRY to get hold of someone on the phone and you get the "WE ARE EXPERIENCING A HIGH VOLUME OF CALLS..." line, Yeah, from all the pissed off people who A) Cannot get through at all, B) Get no response from email queries, C) Who want to talk to someone whose department it is to know how their company works, or D) All of the above.

I personally am dealing with the tomfoolery of dropping my auto-pay because I changed bank accounts, but have NOT gotten throught after 8 phone attempts, and 2 e-mail requests. And no-one has called back yet AFTER TWO WEEKS!!

So what happened?! Those idiots couldn't access my auto-pay so they charged me $30.00! And their letter says that after 15 days if they don't get their blood money ( or garbage money as the case may be ) They will send it to collections.

Well La De Fucking Da. Good luck with that. My guess is I will finally get to talk to someone, as they are reaching for my wallet.

I give props to some of the guys on the line. For the most part, they are doing a decent job under a deadline. But as a company they suck more than a Hoover convention. Monopoly bullies they are.

So remember, it's a shitty world and Republic is there to help take away some of it for you. For a fee, that is.We are at 10 unreturned calls, including one to their corporate office in Phoenix. And two emails ( where I did received the message that a "senior" staff member will contact me in 1-2 business days. Yeah? Well I'm still waiting for the first response from 3/18 ).THE ONLY OPTION FOR GARBAGE SERVICE IN LAS VEGAS/CLARK COUNTY.

Republic Services is the worst utility company in Southern Nevada.  

I have yet to get the "streamlined" service.  No one needs trash pick-up twice a week and having recycling pick-up every other week only encourages people not to recycle.  

The collectors are marginal at best.  Every time I have a pick-up, my garbage can and recycling bins are never returned to the curb in an orderly fashion.  Rather, they are thrown towards the general vicinity of my driveway.  It is very common to find them in the middle of the street or in front of my neighbor's house.

I have also had numerous missed pick-ups in the past seven years.  I've never heard of entire neighborhoods being missed by a garbage truck, yet mine has been missed at least four times in the last seven years.

When you have a question or concern, they treat you terribly.  If you ask for a supervisor, they say they'll have one call back but they never do.Until recently i have had Cox cable for about 10yrs. I have seen the constant rate increases without notice, but the service has stayed the same, or gotten worse. I have called and emailed them at least once per month about the poor Internet service I was receiving, and it was always my fault. 

So I just switched to Century Link, which I was extremely hesitant to do. My Internet speed went from 1.86mbs down to 18mbs down. I have a package with Prism and Internet without the phone, and I saved over $50.00 per month vs. my Cox bill. I have more channels and faster Internet for less monthly.

Cox cable didn't even care when we returned our equipment and cancelled our service. They asked no questions, and asked for no reason for us canceling. They rushed us because they had others in line canceling.

Avoid Cox, and when you switch to Centurylink make sure they don't try to tell you that you have to get a phone line with your package... It saves 30.00 per month without it.BEWARE of setting up service without knowing whether you're signing up for a promotional rate. I'm moving from Cali. to Nevada and called to set up internet and phone with Cox. A representative in Pennsylvania took quite awhile getting all of my information and defining my needs, she found the right service bundle and quoted a price. We came to an agreement after many more questions and went back to that same price she originally quoted, then she had to transfer me to a Nevada rep. the rep. took down more information, she ran my credit (I don't allow this unless I'm doing business with someone) and gave me my new phone number, everything was just about tied in a neat lttle ribbon when she finally decided to tell me this was only a promotional price. They wasted my time, they ran my credit and the supervisor got on the phone to tell me they have customer loyalty rewards after the 6 mo., however, he didn't even seem to know what they were and was incredibly vague about what my bill would be 6 months from now. For such a huge company they sound like they're operating out of a garage and will close up shop in the middle of the night, very shady operation. Obviously, I can't comment on the quality of their service due to this experience I will not be going with Cox for my internet, phone needs.I'm only giving this a star because the install guys are decent, the rest sucks. Normally I'd give this a zero, but i can't so...  I've ordered 2 recent PPV's (one UFC, one WWE) and when you order it, it says "purchase and record this show" which is good, because I work during the time it airs live.  Both shows would unexpectedly pause during the main event and not go any further.  The first time we called for the UFC situation, they rebooted the box remotely and I missed the fight because of the amount of time it took them to do it after being on hold for the duration of the fight.  During the WWE event, the same thing happened, we called to which we were told it was copywritten material and we couldn't record the show.  Keep in mind, it was Cox Cable's message that said "Purchase and Record this show".  Cox said that service was available, Cox sold it to me, and Cox accepted the order, and now I can't watch what i ordered.  

In addition to these incidents, many, many  times around midnight or 1am, if you try to use the On demand feature, it won't work.  Plain and simple.  When I complained about that, the guy on the phone just told me "Yeah, mine does that too and I don't know why".  Thats all, Yet, you still have to pay your bill even though Cox does not fulfill their obligations on services offered.  I wish there were more options but unfortunately, it's extrememely limited, and all of the systems available have pros and cons  I may be looking into Century Link, or go back to Direct TV.  Cox is a freaking joke.  When I lived in Massachusetts, we had Comcast, and never had the types of issues with them, so we know the technology exists, Cox just doesn't care.When my computer expert called Cox for a speed upgrade, he was told my bill would increase by $5.00.  But when my bill arrived, they had pro-rated $22.50, with $45/mo to be charged in the future.  Called a rep immediately (on hold for 25 min.).  She just kept repeating their incorrect billing #'s.  Then she disconnected me while I was waiting for her to research, but never called me back at my obvious phone number on her screen.  So much for Customer Disservice.  Next morning, I tried again and got lucky!  On hold AGAIN for almost half an hour, but I got a guy named CAM who solved everything!  Apparently, the $5 increase was a "6/mo Promotion," but the two previous reps never volunteered this information (uninformed?), nor was the Billing Dept informed.  Sloppy billing practices!  Sloppy sloppy Cox interoffice communication!  Thank God for Cam, wherever he is located.  He corrected my bill.  It's up to the customer to cancel their "6/mo promotion" so watch your Cox bills!!!!Seriously has to be the WORSE cable company in the nation. I have family all over the country and cox communications is horrid. The service is spotty and the connection is never stable. I don't know why anyone would want to voluntarily keep this company as a provider. They charge 20 dollars over the next provider (century link) and I changed to century link and the service is FLAWLESS!!! NOT ONE DROPPED CONNECTION!! been with them 3 months now. In three months I lost connection with cox communications over 2 dozen times. I'm tired of *buying new equipment to meet the high speed standard every 3 months* or buying "faulty equipment" according to my old cox rep. You know what u guys are criminals trying to make a killing, offering substandard service and unreliable customer relations. You are overcharging everyone and you are careless to your customers. I hope you go bankrupt!!!For what you pay (and it's been ever so slowly increasing), this is absolutely the worst service we have ever experienced. We are relatively new to the Vegas area (a year) having moved from California where we had Comcast. I have to say I miss them already. I mean I had issues with them for sure (what cable company doesn't have a plethora of issues?), but, on the whole, service was okay & the rates were somewhat reasonable for Cali. After hearing horror stories about the sub-par cable service in So.NV, we decided to go with Cox as they seemed to be the most 'professional'. 

Yes, we got sucked in with the glitzy ads promising the "fastest" internet speed blah,blah,blah...promo prices up the yazoo, etc etc. Long story short, we now experience excruciatingly slow speed-can't even load a damn web page without goin' on an errand or mowing the lawn first. And yes, I've called tech support numerous times. Works fine for a couple weeks, then it's back to 1994 speed again. What's worse, those low promo prices are just a sucker smokescreen; you get hit w/ so MANY hidden charges, it's ridiculous! We got a landline thrown in a few months ago with promises of free HBO. Well, guess what, the HBO shows up on the bill; when I called 'em about it, they said "Oh, we have to show the HBO charge on the bill, but you're not really charged for it......" I did the math and it didn't add up...we WERE being charged for it. WTF!!!!!!!! Okay, I have to stop now-feel that blood pressure rising ;-) 

You know what, gimme some local ISP w/ decent speed & my Wii-powered Netflix....oh, and my AT&T smartphone. I'm done with these cable monsters. Time to enjoy high desert living! :-)This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a shoe store!  The store was a bit cluttered, but the employees really killed the visit for me.  Out of 4 employees I saw on hand, only the cashier was actually doing her job.  Meanwhile the other 3 are hanging out in the back room just talking with each other, completely abandoning all the customers in the store.

I have an awkward foot size...11.5 4E...so I'm already limited to less that 10% of the shoes on the market fitting my foot.  Subtract the shoes that look like bug vomit and I'm down to about 5%.  This store actually had a few different shoes that were my size and looked pretty decent.  But with the way they stack the shoes all the way to the ceiling in here, it's not like you can just pull the shoe box from the stack easily.  So that means finding an employee and getting their assistance.  Either that or climbing up the shelves King Kong style...but between not having the beautiful Ann Darrow to protect or wanting to fall to the floor, I'm opted out of that option.

So I take a tour thru the aisles looking for an employee to help me out.  I find the 3 floor staffers behind the door back room just talking.  Completely avoiding all customers, just chatting on the clock.  Which in this day in age where the economy sucks and jobs are becoming few and far between, I think that's pretty dumb on their part.  I had to jump in and just say "Hey I need some help over here", and one employee rolls his eyes, huffs and puffs, and gets a ladder to fetch the two shoe boxes I wanted to try.  But between the shoes not really impressing me and the staff being as crappy as possible, I decided against giving them my business.

I will not be returning to this location, that much is for sure.  And those employees, minus the cashier, need to step up their game or get canned, because there are plenty of other people out there that could really use and do that job, and do it well.So I went over memorial day and bought a couch, a dining room set, and a coffee table on sale and spent 5000 dollars.  The day before delivery, they called and said the dining room set was defective and they were canceling the entire shipment and they wanted me to come back and pick something else.  I said I bought it because it was a discounted and would like a refund.  They refused to give me a refund even though they canceled the order on me.  I asked to speak with a manager and they told me he wouldn't be back for a few days but gave me a number which "I could leave a message and he would call me back."  ultimately I had to have my credit card company cancel the transaction.  I will never go into another Walker FurnitureThe pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude.I would not eat here again. Staff not friendly. Not helpful. Small scoop of rice and small portion of chow mein. 

Avoid this place. Portions are extremely small. Better off eating somewhere else.Over staffed, but there is never anyone to help me look at something I am potentially going to buy. No bargaining whatsoever, not even if the item has been there forever.This by Far the Worse Chinese food! I took two bites and threw away the food! DO NOT EAT THERE!Not all robertos are created equally...this one is horrible. Staff is rude, asked for no meat got meat...lucky asked for no cheese and they actually did give me any, but skimped on the fries and the drink...horrible. The one next to my work is so much betterThe wait is to long. Some staff are friendly.  Not a kids friendly urgent care. I waited about 3 hours. Its just funny that graveyard wait times are longer than if you come in the afternoon.We were making a large purchase of Magic Cards to run an employee tournament and called to see if they would price match.  We could get 3 boxes with overnight shipping of $40 for less than the cost of 3 boxes at the store and they refused to drop the price at all.

Little Shop of Magic matched the price.  Glad we were able to support a local store and we clearly know where we are doing all of our future business.This place deserves no stars.. This is one of the worst places to get your nails done or any service. Its very dirty,the workers are rude, they talk crap on front of you. I know a few words and slangs and I told the lady I understand what your saying...Horrible. My gel nails could have been done by my kid nephew! NEVER going here again!!Probably the worst Asian buffet I've ever been to. Food was stale tasting, questionable texture of the meat items, the floors looked dirtier than a homeless persons box and the bathrooms might as well be an alley sewer drain. Who cares if its a buffet, it's still $9.50 for lunch. I've gotten more satisfaction from a lottery ticket that didn't match any numbers.I definitely would not recommend this buffet.

Price was $15 during dinner, which is outrageously expensive because the selection wasn't good for the price and the food tasted terrible. There was not one dish that I enjoyed here.

I had a really hard time enjoying this place. It looks and feels dirty. Flies flying around the food.

So to summarize.. EXPENSIVE, BAD SELECTION FOR $$$$, BAD QUALITY, DIRTY...

I have no idea why some people would rate this place highly...they are either associated with Buffet @ Asia or they have been fed dog food their whole lives. Seriously.

STAY AWAY...YOU WILL REGRET THIS PLACE IF YOU GO HERE..TRUST ME.I keep having the same problem everytime I go here...they are ALWAYS out of everything! The employees have always been decent with me (it's a hit or miss. Some are very nice and helpful. Some are just rude and treat you like an inconvenience) but whoever is doing the stocking of that store or maybe it's at a corporate level needs to start doing a better job. I come here mostly for NYX cosmetics because I can't find it anywhere else. EVERYTIME they are out of the one powder color I need. I asked the girl when they would be getting more in and she just shrugged. You look around the aisles and most of the products don't have prices, there are bottles opened and just really messy and worst of all I have to inspect all the things I buy because the majority of them have been used (like people stick their fingers in them or use the lipsticks) which is sooooooo unsanitary! Get your act together ULTA! Also I went in once back in May to get the opi gel Polish put on my nails for a wedding I was leaving out of town for the next day. I called right when they opened that morning and made an appointment for 5pm. I got their 15min prior and was seated. At 5 they went over to the stylist who was to do my nails and told her I was there. I could CLEARLY hear the stylist tell the receptionist that she doesn't want to do them, that she just wants to go home. She rolled her eyes, put on a fake smile and came over to talk to me. She then proceeded to tell me that she was over booked and she couldn't do it but I could come in the next day. I told her I was leaving for a wedding and couldn't do that. She then looked at my nails and made a disgusted face and said she couldn't do anything with my nails anyways and offered for me to come in after my trip. It was ridiculous and needless to say I didn't.I ordered through Eat24 on my phone. Great app, but the food was disgusting. It took over an hour and the pad Thai was a solid block, dry, and bland (I ordered spice level 7). The spring rolls were soaked through with grease and were inedible. So disappointed!Wost customer service ever.  I came here to purchase a brand new labtop on a wenesday night.  I stood around looking for about 5 minutes before someone asked me if I needed assistance.  After another 15 minutes of waiting the same worker asked if anyone had come over yet.  Finally someone came over.  At this point I figured they had enlisted their top notch elite to come assist me, I was sadly mistaken.  They sent some hourly moron who didn't know anything about labtops.  She just read the description right below it.  I asked to speak to the manager and they directed to some schlub named bill who just said sowwwyyyyy.  Thanks a lot idiots next time I'll go to fry'sThe staff is so unprofessional from the cashiers to the manager. Take your job seriously for once and stop talking like your in a break room! I went to go buy balloons and got the worst customer service ever. And all the manager did was kiss up to every customer that was annoyed. All they do was lay back and relax.Cheap beer, inconsistent service. for a local bar, some bartenders have a large dose of "the cool". Don't gamble here. The bartenders will make like your drinks are comped, then stick you with a bill that covers one free drink. We dumped about $120 in their machines (and the win a lobster machine) and received 2 free beers. Our cheapest drinks! Haven't been back...I love trying out new food places. Since me and my boyfriend was around the area and was craving for some AYCE sushi, we decided to go here. I was a little skeptical because of all the bad reviews to this place. I first saw Yummy Sushi and Grill along the same neighborhood and had better reviews, but too bad they don't offer AYCE.

When we walked inside the place, nobody was there but the waitress and one cook. They were both sitting down, probably waiting for customers. I didn't bother asking how much the lunch was since i had an idea that it would only be around $20 each person.

First impression? DEAD. No music, just a TV with no sound at all. Employees looked so bored they didn't even bother greeting us whatsoever. I feel like the waitress was a little disappointed to see customers walking in. She has a little attitude.
The smell of the place was horrendous, the place didn't feel like a sushi place at all. The menus felt sticky and dirty. Eww.

So we ordered a few, i give them one star for not-so-bad sushi rolls. They were tasty, to be honest, but the thing is, the sushi rolls were not made well. Did i say they don't taste fresh? ALL the rolls were falling apart. The rice was not packed enough so it makes a huge mess whenever you pick up the rolls.

Lemme tell ya, i'm a bit picky with my sushi rolls maybe because Sushi Kaya and Yama Sushi spoiled me so much...yes, in a good way. I love my rolls plated separately and accordingly so that the sauce wouldn't bleed or touch other rolls. Let's get straight to the point, their sushi rolls are all in one plate! 3 different kind rolls all in one plate. I ordered this sushi roll with lime juice in it, so it kinda has a sourness taste to it. Just because they were plated all in one plate, they all tasted sour-ish and limey too.

And when you think of baked and deep fried rolls, they're supposed to be hot, right? Well total opposite!

Now let's go to the desserts, when it says AYCE, it means you can eat all you want, but make sure to finish it. I understand their *one order per person* rule on some selections. I tried ordering Green tea ice cream, and Mango mochi, but the waitress was like, "no, you can't order more than one dessert!" Like whaatt?! In an AYCE?! I. CAN'T. EVEN....

Check out: So when you check in to Yelp, you get this $5 off coupon. I showed it to the waitress using my iPhone, and then the lady literally TOOK my phone off my hand and brought it with her for a good 15min! I was in total shock during that 15min wait. Like really? I've never experienced anything like that before! LOL i don't even let anyone take my phone even for 5 sec and she just took it like it's just a paper coupon? Oh my gracious gravy.

My total bill was $45 for 2 person. I believe their AYCE per person is $23 during lunch. NOT WORTH MY MONEY AT ALL. Definitely worth trying so i know which one to avoid. Hah.

I'd say: save your money, go to Sushi Kaya or Yama Sushi!We had a great experience with the first lady we worked with who had dark long hair. Then she passed us off to a woman with short blonde hair and she was terrible. She was pressuring us into getting our rings. When we told her that we were considering just looking and shopping around she turned around huffing and puffing and proceeded to walk off. Then we were left in the dust and we were no longer being looked after. This is my second bad shopping experience with them. Do not come here!Food Poisoning ... enough said.    No more reheater places for me!  Well as long as the wife doesn't force me.most horrible experience i have ever had at a restaurant. The pasta was very under cooked and the pasta sauce had no taste. horrible unprofessional wait staffThis has got to be the worst Walmart in Las Vegas.  It's pure filth:  I went to take a cart from where they're stacked up inside the store, not in the entryway like at other branches.  They weren't exactly stacked up; the store wasn't all that crowded, and there were only a few carts available.  And they sat on a floor so covered in black grime, it looked as if it hadn't been washed since the place opened.  Of course, there were none of those disinfectant wipes availabe to hose down the cart - or me.

I had a list of about six things that I needed, and true to form, they were out of three of them.  These were not exotic items, just stuff like Wite-Out, suntan lotion, but I batted only .500.  And that suntan lotion was their own Equate brand, which had been rated the best in Consumer Reports.  Unbelievable!

I had misgivings about going to this Walmart in the first place;  it's always disgusting,  and I did only because I was going to Ulta on Lake Mead and Rainbow.  I won't make that mistake again.  This branch should be condemned by the Board of Health.The sad thing about Walmart is no matter how awful the customer service, the lack of customer consideration, or cleanliness, they will always do well.  Because when it comes to getting the cheapest junk for the lowest price the customers will always flock.  Some out of choice, some out of habit. 

Over the run of the last six years, I can count on one hand how many times I have visited this Walmart.  I have visited at off-hours because I could not imagine dealing with them in the middle of the day.  

One register open for six or seven people in line?  Check.
Employees openly swearing and featuring colorful language?  You got it.
Cashiers more interested in having personal conversations vs. assisting the customer?  THERE IT IS!

In terms of customer service, one of the worst establishments I have ever been to.  One day when I was struggling to carry plastic bins no one offered to help me carry, move, scan, or get them out to my car.  Rather stand and pretend that they don't see me.  And as I mentioned, walking around and hearing colorful language that I shouldn't hear PERIOD let alone at a business.

I don't know WHO their night manager is but they're failing.  Miserably.  Particularly the front end so no matter how great your shopping experience was (i.e. had everything in stock, found everything quickly or on sale...), you have to go through an individual who doesn't care and lets you know it.  Dry, unfriendly, sarcastic.  

I couldn't help but notice last time that they got rid of the "Did the Cashier greet you?" question at the credit/debit card scanner.  When you've given up on enforcing manners then you're really in a sorry state.

I'll give my money to Target or Ross ANYTIME over Walmart, especially this one.drive through is horrible customer service..This was the fastest pedicure I've ever had in my life, I'm beyond disappointed and I will never return.  I arrived at 3pm, I was done by 3:19pm.

The decor is horrible, it's like they tried to be classy in the 1990's  it's like thrift store decor. Old products, most of the nail polishes where half empty (I always carry my favorite color in my purse).

Needless to say, I'm very disappointed, I wasn't relaxed, I was uncomfortable, and  it was SO fast and not in a pleasant way. 

I will never return and I would never recommend this place,ever!Very poor Service... Has a 42 minute wait when they had said that it was gonna be a 20 minute wait.... Never again I will order from Dominos at all.Not impressed. I came here when I was starving after a late-night flight for some late-night chow. #FAIL 

I discarded my shrimp burrito mid-way b/c it had a glass-cleaner/freezer-burnt taste and was generally repulsive. I knew that if I finished it, I'd feel like crap for the entire next day. After a few bites I felt like I'd just chowed down a harvest of grain. My poor stomach.A few minutes after our family's food was ready, we realized our toddler's chicken nuggets order was not served. Turns out they hadn't even started to make it. When we finally received it, it was raw in the center! I showed the cashier the raw chicken and she gave me a refund (she gave no apology and seemed not to care). Also, one of the salsas at the salsa bar was spoiled.Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste.This was the most disgusting place I have ever been to, I am so seriously surprised that the health department is allowing this place to stay open, I found an unidentified object in my soup, this place was so nasty, the windows you cannot see out of from the filth, the food is GROSSSSSSSS. This is just a depressing environment, not a place to waste 10.00 on a meal.I got a coupon for an oil change.  Talk about bait and switch.  It offered $19.95, but after giving me sort of ridiculous excuses, the charge for my beetle was going to be $39.95 !!!  And they said it used 8 qts of oil (I wonder where they would put it !!).  I guess their bankruptcy has inflated their costs....  I told them not to bother sending me coupons anymore and wasting my time.This place has terrible customer service. I was in the drive through and wanted to add a soda to my order and they told me I couldn't get one because someone was behind me and the couldn't re-open my check?! That is so ridiculous. What kind of business is this where I can't add something to my order? They couldn't have gone to another register that was open?! I have never been to a place in my life that was not able to add something to a check. They must not want any business. They need to train their staff a lot better!!This bank is horrible I am so glad I am no longer a customer. This bank is like the Walmart of banks 30 people in line 2 tellers and 10 other employees walking around looking at the wall paper. If you are in a hurry avoid this location.Straight ghetto filthy place this person was sitting at a table with no food and dirty cleats an socks on the table! As I was ordering the person preparing the food was picking at it and eating the food while she worked gross!! I know it happens but come on then she proceeded to keep working and for every three she packaged !  I let the "Shift Leader" know -nothing changed! Filthy place with low standards go somewhere else yelpers!LIARS!!!! Sign said open til 1 am and it was 12:50 and they were still there! My taco bell satisfaction was ripped from me. I thought this was America, taking away my Taco Bell privileges and sh*t. Good thing jack in the box is always here for us and they are nice!!!!!!EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in James, owner of Hondatronics. Just bought a used Acura, and after reading positive reviews here & other sites, decided to take my car there to see if I needed to fix/replace anything. I had no weird noises or anything, just wanted it to get checked out for peace of mind. James checked it out for me & seemed very courteous & helpful, which along with the reviews here instantly put me at ease. He checked out the car, and said everything looked fine, except for my front & right engine mounts which were cracked/broken. He said this was pretty common on my particular year/model Acura, and that although no immediate danger to me, I should think about replacing them. Parts/labor=$560 ($320/$240).

Well, I bought genuine Honda parts online for $180, and had got a quote from a GREAT SHOP in Henderson (704 W sunset) for $170 tax included to install both engine mounts. Thought I was a champ for figuring out a way to save $210!  Anyways, took it there, and 5 minutes later the mechanic came out & said "Who told you to change these mounts?? They're both fine." He took me under my car to show me both mounts in question, and both looked just like the new parts albeit a little dirty. If I hadn't gone through the trouble and just blindly listened to James @ Hondatronics, I woulda gladly just paid the $560 for something I didn't even need! Sadly, he is the owner, so it's not like I got some unscrupulous worker trying to make a quick buck.  Maybe he is honest MOST of the time, but please-please-please get a 2nd opinion at the very least if he recommends anything other than an oil change. Such a frustrating experience!!!  This bothered me so much that this is my first yelp review...

p.s.  Come to think of it, no wonder I was told that I couldn't go and take a look at my car at Hondatronics--there were no broken/cracked parts to show me!!  I've been taken to the work area for a visual diagnosis at Sam's Club, Midas, Jiffy Lube, and many other shops here in Vegas...(Part 2 of Nevada Federal Credit Union Rant-see linked review)

I was told that since I came in later on in the day that she was not obligated to return my call that evening (rolling of the eyes.) She also was not in the office the following day but I am not too sure why she couldn't call me on the THIRD DAY with results. After repeating my various grievances I just asked her to close my account. There was no "oh we are so sorry to see you go" or maybe a "do you want me to try my manager again?" She cut me a check and sent me on my way...OH but I almost forgot, she advised me that normally the CU charges $20 to close accounts (HAHAHAHAHAHA) but she did me the "favor" of waiving that fee. I told her "thank you SO MUCH for doing me that favor" and stormed out as I was flipping off the building lol. 

All in all, their customer service is non existent. They are so concerned with upholding policy and procedure that they do not care if customers/members leave as a result of that. I have to say I was surprised that they treated me the way they did but I guess it's how the cookie crumbles now a days (so to speak.) They are not a Credit Union nor do they behave as one...I might of just banked at B of A with their asinine fees had I known any better ;-)When I opened my account almost two years ago, I turned down the overdraft option. I was told that whether it was a credit/debit or check, I would not be charged an overdraft fee and my request for payment would be denied flat out. I opened the account so that I could have all my utilities auto drafted from my account and was warned that if there wasn't enough money in my account the bill would not be paid and that would be embarrassing. But that has never been a problem so I said I didn't want overdraft. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. My husband and I had gone out for drinks and when I went to pay with my card, the bartender told me my card was denied. So I pulled out my handy dandy NV One app and I see that my account had been overdrafted because of an outrageous charge from Cox cable. Odd, but I figure that since I didn't have overdraft it was probably a mistake and it would be sorted out. I normally keep enough money in my account to pay the bills for a couple months, but at the time I was in the middle of a bankruptcy so I only deposited one paycheck a month.

The outrageous charge from Cox cable was credited to my billing account. Long story short, someone else's modem was charged to my account. So I went to NV One to explain the situation to them and have the overdraft taken off and had the pleasure of dealing with Suzy Drinkwine. She informed me that since the bill was drafted monthly from my account that they would overdraft my account to make the payment. When I told her I had opted to not have overdraft, she just repeated herself. Yes the bill is drafted monthly, but it runs as a check or a credit/debit card would so how does that make it ok to charge me a $30 fee? She just kept repeating herself over very rudely. I would've closed the account right then, but since I was in the middle of the bankruptcy, my hands were tied.

The worst part of the situation is that a utility company that I allow to auto draft from my account screwed up big time and my bank did nothing to protect me. Instead they made it an opportunity to steal from me. What a shame.Rude service.  They blame all their mistakes on the "teamsters".  Horrible union based company that cannot take any responsibilities for their own actions.  If I had a choice I would never use them again but whats the use in complaining when they already have contracts with all the convention halls.I used to go here all the time until I got a greedy waitress. Apparently the 25% tip I left wasn't enough so she decided to leave herself an extra $40 on my $22 bill! Make sure you check your card statements after you go here!!Disgusting dispatch service and drivers that LOVE to sexually harrass women and take them on terror rides not letting them out of the cab. Twice already they've been reported Taxi Authority. Since drivers went on strike they're hiring psychos and allowing Vegas locals to be long-hauled and disrespected. Worse service by far. I am a local in Vegas so heed this warning. For 4 years this cab company has been ruining our tourism by displaying Neanderthal business practices and hiring sexual offenders and criminals. Nice job Ace. Tourists and locals seek anyone.but this.company and their sister cab companies. Deposits for drivers dont exist. Taking the expressway NOT the only way to get to a location. Take their cab number name and time they we were working. Call their employment and the Taxi Authority. Its that easy to report a negative experince.So fucking terrible. I've had several bad experiences with this cab company. Particularly in the way they try to long haul customers. However on this particular morning I'm extremely annoyed because I called for a cab at 545AM they tell me it'll be to me by 615. It's now 655 and the driver has called me 3 times for directions. Why in the hell would you be a cab driver if you don't use navigation or have any sense of where in the fuck you're going? He calls and barely speaks English asking me how to get from where he is to me. I tell him 215 Far Hills exit. The exit right after red rock casino. Not difficult right? Oh no, 2 more calls after that asking for step by step directions. So I finally tell him, "Listen, if you don't know where I am, call your dispatcher, it's not my job to direct you. I call the company tell them where I am and ask for a cab." Jesus Christ I hate this cab company.Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!I had a follow up appointment here at 1:00. I was called back around 1 and they took my blood pressure then told to go back to waiting room until a room opened. At 1:15 I asked front desk how long it would be because I had to work that day.  She looked at the files and said there were 7 appointments a head of me!!! 7!!!! Why even make an appointment if you can not see the patient somewhere close to their appointment time??? Not only did I waste my time but wasted gas driving there for nothing!I have to start out by saying I have never used this company for anything. However I sat behind two of their techs (in uniform) and overheard their conversation over lunch. Can't count how many times they dropped the F-bomb, then they were discussing a service call that came in, and one of the two recommended that because it was a warranty call, he should just do a drive by and say there was no one home!! No concern for the representation of the company or who may be overhearing this sad conversation.I had these guys service my Mother's pool for about 2 years. The last year I lived there and continued using the service. Not once did I ever see them check the chemical levels in the pool. All he ever did was put chlorine tabs in the chlorinator. Then I got mustard algae big time in the pool. I found that strange since they serviced the pool every two weeks. But like I said, I never once saw them check the chemical levels. He would come and go so fast, I had to look out for him to be able to catch him and talk about the pool. Their solution for the mustard algae was to pour 12 gallons of chlorine in the pool, and that was the owner who came out. He never checked chemical levels either, he just poured in all that chlorine.I then had the pool guy change out the filters, which he did as a side job. He charged me 315.00 to do that.  I cancelled the service after that and decided to take care of it on my own. The chemical levels were so off that they didn't even register. (Muriatic acid and soda ash for low pH) But chlorine level was off the charts. I researched online about pool chemicals, and now test the chemicals every two weeks. (Like I thought they were doing...Not ! ) Forty bucks a month to put chlorine tabs in the chlorinator is a joke. If you currently have them servicing your pool, ask them what the chlorine, bromine, acid, and alkaline levels are in your pool. If they don't know, or make guesses, you'll realize their not doing the job their suppose to do. Having a chemical imbalance in your pool, is not good for swimmers at all. Don't assume. Better yet get a test kit and check your pool chemical levels yourself. If there right, then their doing their job, If not....sayonara.i highly recommend DO NOT GO HERE. THIS IS THIER SO CALLED CENTRAL LOCATION.or HQ THEY still use the name THEY ARE NOT AL PHILLIPS.al phillips sold it a long time ago.they have been owned by banks and other companys for over 15 years now.they treat their customers like crap and their workers even worse.if they ruin your clothes(which they do quite often)you need a reciept for the stuff that they ruined or they will not do crap they will give you cleaning credit,who the hell wants credit .so that they can do it again no way .if you work for them and they dont like you for some reason or if they want a friend of the district manager then they will set you up to get you fired, and make you look like a theif.when they are the ones who rip off thier customersthey charge $6.19 for a pair of pants.for that price you have it cleaned 3 or 4 times you could buy a new pair.and what do you get for that price the same that you would get at a cheaper place.the same quality may be even better.Let me start by saying that I've been to this ER 10 times, and have been admitted for a 3-5 day stay 8 times over the last 3 years. 
I have a chronic kidney condition that acts up every couple months and usually leaves me laid up for a week in excruciating pain.

After my last 2 experiences, I will never come back to this ER EVER again, if I can help it.

ER review: 
When I first came here after my surgeries, everyone was kind, attentive, and VERY good...getting IVs was fairly painless (for getting an IV).

The second to last time I was in, I gave them my back story (chronic kidney pain, CANNOT do a CT, because I had a surgical clip left inside of me that looks like a kidney stone when a CT is done.  They have to do a renal scan).

Two hours of pain later, the radiology guy comes back to give me a CT.  
Ok fine...but can I get SOMETHING for the pain?  "We have to give you a non-narcotic."  Ok fine, I know my history makes me look like a drug seeker (which I'm not).  "Non-Narcotics trash my kidneys and make me ill.  Call my surgeon, Dr. _____.  I always get dilauded when I'm in here. 2 mg, with Zofran for the nausea."   

"Well we can give you morphine"

"Can someone please look at my records?  I'm allergic.  Morphine makes me itch.  How about an asprin?  Something?  SOMETHING to take the edge off until you talk to a Doctor about getting me pain killers."

So they finally get me something...and I get it, you have to weed out the seekers.  I've heard them before.  But after waiting two hours, not complaining at all, not ASKING for any painkillers till that point...plus they can look up my records.

Nevermind the fact that it took 3 people to start my IV.  *sigh*

Anyway, after all this, they give me a CT...and surprise!  "You have a stone."
me: "No I don't, I have a surgical clip that was left inside me.  I told them this at admitting.  You have to do an ultrasound or a renal scan."

So they finally do and guess what...ITS A CLIP, NOT A STONE!!  *sigh*
Idiots.  Not all of us are clueless here.

So they admit me.  Detailed hospital review to follow.  
The LAST time I went to the ER, I was having chest pains. 

They took me right back for an EKG, which apparently was normal?  Because I sat in an empty waiting room for two hours before they brought me back for further examination.

They said "Its not your heart.  Here, we're going to give you morphine and a nitro drip."

me:  "um.  What?  Why am I getting morphine?  I'm allergic."

"Well what do you usually get?"

Me: "Dilauded...but I don't..."

Them (cutting me off) "Well we don't give that for heart issues."

Me: "Number 1, you JUST said it wasn't my heart.  Number two...I don't WANT a pain killer, I want to know what is wrong with me.  Number three, if it isn't my heart, WHY are you giving me a nitro drip?  No.  Sorry.  I'm going home."  

Signed out AMA.  Not that I actually GOT any medical advice, but I figured if I was going to die, I wanted to do so in my own bed.   (turns out I was just REALLY stressed.)

So...onto the Hospital stays.

Again, when I first was admitted, everyone was awesome.  

The last 2 times I was admitted was AWFUL.

I had Nurses who gave me attitude, doctors prescribing blood thinner shots, and ANTIDEPRESSANTS (for a kidney issue.  Yeah...what sense does that make?)

So...Whenever I'm admitted to the hospital, I'm on dilauded for 3-4 days.  The first 2 days, I ALWAYS get sick.  ALWAYS.  Even with Zofran for nausea.  I always throw up at least once.  

The second to last time I was in, it was my first night.  I was in pain, miserable, and just got hit with a wave of nausea.  I tried to get out of bed to grab a bucket, trash can, get to the bathroom, anything, but I didn't make it, and I vomited on the floor next to my bed. So now, I'm in pain, miserable, nauseated, and embarrassed.  And the nurse gave me attitude about it.  Yes.  I vomited on the floor JUST to piss you off.

The last time I was in, I had a similar experience, I was being wheeled up to my room, and was vomiting in a bucket (sometimes you just can't help it) and the nursing staff looked absolutely disgusted.
This is your JOB.  To take care of people who are ill...if you have to look disgusted about a little vomit, at least walk away first.  Don't make us feel worse.

I will NEVER come back here again, unless I am unconscious and have no choice.DO NOT GO HERE! These people are rude and unprofessional! I was here 3 times in the ER for gallbladder issues and after 8-14 hours each time of waiting they told me it was gas. On the 4th time, I had to have gallbladder surgery the next morning which was only a few hours away. Their offices are NO BETTER. 5380 S.RAINBOW #306
Dr. Dubin's office also has rude staff. I went here for the lipo-laser treatments from a Living Social deal and it is FAKE!!!! No results, nothing. They only gave me two out of the three treatments I paid for they only did the light and vibrations, they never gave me the wraps... Don't even bother going here, there is no real website, no clear name for this office and I never even met Dr. Dubin. I wish I could give negative stars!You hear it now and then, from either the media or some well informed friend,  "that the medical industry is just a business". This place unfortunately proved that for me and my family. The details aren't worth mentioning but I'm glad it's over. Against doctors advice we checked my father out of this hospital, it saved his life. Told the story to our doctors back home and they were astonished. Money seems to be the main motivation here at this hospital. If you got little no no insurance expect poor care. If you got good insurance I'm sure they'll be begging you to stay.  It's true the ER is a mess. Before my father was transferred here from mesquite Nevada, the head nurse discouraged out decision to take him here, and now I know why. You don't have to take my word, but hopefully if you come to this hospital, you'll have a better experience than we did.The phone number listed is no longer in service. Is this place now out of business?I have lived in this complex since 1998 and have been through a number of management companies. Current Management has been underwhelming to say the least. They have changed the front gate entrance from card keys to a numerical code and everyone has the exact same code, not very secure. They have made the process of picking up a package from the office more difficult than it needs to be and I have been waiting for maintenance to come fix the toilet in my bathroom which is unusable for almost four hours. Not holding out much hope that they will show up today.Absolutely the worst! I have lived here for about 3 years and things have been fine. Within the past 4-6 months the owners have changed and service/experience is dismal! When I've had to go to the office to speak with them they continually close early (45 minutes to an hour) and play coy as if the door was locked by some ultimate force outside their understanding. We lose water service on average once a month-often times with no warning. When calling the emergency service number they are certain to know nothing of it in addition their prime directive is not bothering the property manager with such trivial matters. I have been waiting over a month for a service request. When they finally did come to repair the issue, they replaced the appliance with a broken one and I am not waiting for them again to rectify their sub-par work. There have been a number of break-ins, my parents vehicle being one of them. There is no security, gate is constantly broken, pool may as well not exist as it is always "locked for service". Parking is a nightmare as we only have one assigned spot. There is, however someone always parked in our spot. When I've told the office they tell me that I can put a sticker on the vehicle if I wish...they won't do anything. The place is disgusting, run-down, infested by cockroaches, and run by the most incompetent and unsympathetic individuals. I cannot get out of this lease fast enough. Stay away-you've been warned.I like Panda Express' food but this location just can't seep to get things right.  I've stopped here now three different times after work because of the drive-thru and because my fiancé asked me to.  On the first two occasions they got my order wrong and on the third and last time they gave me the incorrect change which was weird because she was about to give me the correct change but for some reason, took it back and said "sorry that was the wrong change".   I let it go because it was only a dollar-or-so but, if I can do the math in my head then it should certainly be easy enough to follow on the register.  Three times in a row can't be a fluke!Never coming back here. Came In for a dry trim. This is when they do not wash your hair, they just dust off some uneven ends usually $5-15. The entire time this Asian lady just kept insulting my hair, from my color to the cut to some damage (my hair is not that bad at all). She kept pushing for a million little things as I kept repeating I just want a dry trim please. She wouldn't stop! Then insisted on cutting it shorter than I wanted. I said no and she did it anyway and said it would look better. It doesn't. Then she charged me $35 for a $5 service. Ridiculous, I will never return.DO NOT GO HERE!! I cannot stress this enough...do not go here.

I own a Toyota that I took into this shop awhile back to have the brakes looked at. I did not have an appointment so I arrived early at 8:30AM. It was made very clear that I needed the car back by 12:30pm at the VERY latest, and if this was not possible I would be happy to take bring it in later in the week. Alex assured me the car would be done by 12:30pm several times before I left my keys with him. At 12:30pm I called to make sure the car was ready before I arranged for a ride to go back to the shop, at this time I was told it was not ready and they would be an additional 30 minutes to finish. At this point I was upset, but was able to reschedule my meeting from 1:00pm to 1:30pm with my client. At 1:00pm I arrived to the shop only to find that my car was up in the air, tires off, with no one anywhere near it. When I asked Chandler why the car was not ready even though I was assured by Alex it would be done before 12:30pm he told me they just had to put it back together and that it would be done in a few minutes. Twenty minutes later (1:20) I approached the desk again and asked Chandler what the status was on the car. He again told me that it would be done in just a few minutes. I reminded him this is what he told me nearly half an hour ago and asked that he check the status with the mechanic before quoting me a time. He said he would go to the back and see what was going on. At this point, I called to reschedule the appointment with my client to 2:30pm. I waited for another fifteen minutes (1:45pm), and Chandler was nowhere to be found. I literally had to walk around the building to find him in the back, speaking with two other staff members smoking a cigarette. Again, I asked what the status of the car was. Chandler told me it was going to take at least another hour or so to be finished. When I asked Chandler why he was standing around in the back and didn't come back into the store to tell me it wasn't going to be just a few more minutes when he knew that I have needed this car since 12:30pm to meet my client, he had no response. I asked for a manager and was told that one wasn't available but that someone would call me. At this point my client had cancelled on me.

At nearly 3pm the car was put back together and returned to me. Also at this time I was told that they were not able to fix the problem and that I owed $149 even though they didn't fix anything. The cashier stated that the problem was partially fixed and I will be charged for the full amount but they were not able to tell me what had been fixed. After approaching the first stop sign upon leaving the shop it was apparent the problem had not been fixed at all, not even partially.

I have NEVER had such a terrible service experience.I don't know if they had an off day or something, but the food was just horrible. I ordered the pad Thai noodles, chicken chow mien and egg rolls.  The best thing we got was the chicken chow mien, but don't get too excited it was the best of the worst.  They do give large portions of food, but I like quality over quantity. The pad Thai sauce tasted like it came from a box. Most of my order went into the trash :( the egg rolls hardly had any meat in it.  We asked for hot mustard as a condiment and we got some weird concoction of curried spice with French's yellow mustard.  Needless to say it was disgusting. 

I was super sad when they said they don't make walnut shrimp, but hey it happens!  They have cashew shrimp, but after reading the ingredients I knew it was far from what I wanted. 

Maybe it was a bad day for the chef?! Regardless I doubt I will be coming back.  I was super excited about trying this place too because of the ratings and reviews.  I am severely disappointed.  Perhaps it's because they try to cater to two different types of cuisines.  Maybe they should concentrate on being a Chinese restaurant and drop the Thai stuff.DO NOT GO HERE. I went to her as a child for orthodontics and it was such a horrible experience that my dad made her remove them. Then 8 years later i've had to have another set of braces due to her poor treatment! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!I buy my smokes at the little smoke shop next door, so if I need something small, I'll sometimes run in before heading home.  

Their selection is pathetic.  The few times I did shop there right after moving to the neighborhood, I'd have to make a second stop somewhere else, because this store does not carry easily half of the staples in my kitchen.  Their meat and produce sections are worse than AWFUL.  I wouldn't take most of their selections if they were free, and to make it worse, their prices on their crappy produce is in line with Whole Foods.  

If I'm grabbing sodas for a party, or a bag of ice, I'll accept their high prices for the convenience of it being around the corner from my house, or because I'm already in the parking lot, but I'll never do an actual grocery shopping trip here again.  

Do yourself a favor.  Make the drive to Flamingo and Sandhill.  The Smiths there has a much better selection, better produce, better meat selection, better bakery, better prices, and friendlier staff.Food poisoning! Yikes! AVOIDNo, no, no, no no!!!

No water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course againTook my wife to this joint. Not impressed,  I ordered the most basic of mexican cuisine,  Chile Rellenos & Tamales and were disgusting, tasteless and offensive. Do not waste your money, Taco Bell would of been 100x's betterYou tricked me Sam's Town. I fell for the 9.99 (with card) all you can eat Prime Rib
buffet. EWWWWWWW. . The best part about this buffet was the fountain drink.  The 
Prime Rib was bland and overcooked. The green beans were frozen, the pasta 
was horrible, and the rice was too salty. The Mexican fare was beyond crappy. Frozen tacquitos, canned re fried beans, and greasy machaca were some of the choices available.  Having lived in Las Vegas for almost 7 years, I have been to a number of buffets. However, none were as god-awful as this one.I went into this store to buy a new body for my sons slash and to buy a new slash 4x4 probably was going to spend close to $1000 so we can race, The fat Hispanic kid ,that was the only one there because they just opened,was behind the counter, so I go to look at the body's and ask him which ones will fit a slash? He sarcastically replies, "it says right on the tags!" So I think to my self guess he doesn't want to help me?? What kind of trash store is this? Then I ask him what's a slash nitro? Because I was interested in purchasing one and his reply from behind the counter again sarcasticly was, "it's a slash nitro." So at that point I had enough and walked out of the store and went to this other hobby store called hobby town, and ended up spending $1,136 in RC cars and parts, hobby town has excellent customer service, I will spend my money here from now on instead of hobby people. And they wonder why hobby stores go out of business, because you hire sarcastic little pricks with no customer service skills!01/22/13 MATINEE

We got to this theater complex, which we've never used before, a full 40 minutes prior to the 205pm showtime of "The Impossible". 

But we never got to see the film. 

WHY? 

Because after waiting in a line for the box office, we were told by someone in the box office that (unlike the Century Suncoast) in order to take advantage of Tuesday-only "geezer" rates, you had to walk over to a "kiosk", swipe your Boyd card, get a coupon, then return to that box office line again, and then they will honor said coupon for the rate. 

Well, there was a line for the "kiosk", a Microsoft piece-of-s**t contraption. Took forever. WHY are they sending these poor, older folks over to an "electronica" device, to do this bulls**t step? Plus there was no one around to help people. 

Then, when one of our "geezer"s cards was swiped, it said "I cannot look up your information at this time", or some such message. 

So we gave up.

Instead, we drove to the "new" AMC Town Square (AMC purchased the theaters from RAVE), where they are still honoring the $5 Tuesday rate, and we saw the movie! 

We will never return to this Century cineplex. We'll continue to go to Century Cinedome Henderson & Century Suncoast, because we've had little to any problems there. (Other than "talkers" and "seat-kickers" and "perfume factories", and we've given up trying to avoid those people. It's useless. Which is why we'll be cutting WAY back on movie theaters, in 2013 and beyond.)I had been to this place twice and both times were horrible experiences. I first went to retouch my roots (bleach) and then to bleach a section of hair. The first hair dresser almost destroyed my hair and I end up with a kind of grey tone on my hair. Second and different hair dresser burn my scalp and hair so badly that the manager offered me a free treatment. I tried numerous time to get my well deserve treatment but they never had the one I need it on the salon. It seems that the manager of this salon only hires  incompetents employees.If you want to be pushed to the end of the line, this is your place, Linda and Tina along with Larry will push customers into chairs to wait "5" min. or let you soak for 30!
Sun City Crowd.....Have at it!Only reason for One Star is Yelp! won't let you do ZERO stars.

Dr. Nauman is sweet lady and we've always had good experiences with her. But her staff is a JOKE and the LACK OF ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS is a huge slap in the face when you go there. We've had issues with our infants shot records, by this I mean they have no idea what shots she was given and which shots she needs. Whenever our little one needs shots, they are ALWAYS OUT of one or more needed shots and we get the run around of when that shot will be available. We are told the shot(s) will be in within 2 days and they'll call us when they arrive. We always end up having to call them and when we do call the answer is always "It'll be in on Monday".. this has been going on for over a month now. 

We get told she needs one shot.. we call back to see if that's available and we get told she needs 5 shots?!?!?! We explain she only needed 1 shot, we then get put on hold so they can look at her records?!?!?! Then where are they getting this information??? 

Just a real sorry excuse for medical staff and a massive lack of organizational skills. 

WE HAVE CALLED ANOTHER PEDIATRICS TO TAKE OUR BUSINESS TOO. 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY!!! YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY ARE INJECTING OR DOUBLE INJECTING YOUR CHILD WITH!!!!The ambiance is nice but the food was bland. The crostini w/ goat cheese & red peppers lack the savory taste you would expect.  The spaghetti & meatballs was bland.  No seasoning.  Ragu & Costco frozen meatballs would have been better. The waiter had no personality either. Chocolate soufflé cake & cappuccino were the only things worth eating.Don't go here with a pre-arranged large group!  I am not the person to complain to restaurants about anything.. I normally just pay the bill an never come back if i'm unsatisfied. Our neighborhood club booked us for happy hour for approx. 30-40 people well in advance.  The person who arranged it for us told the restaurant that we would need separate checks and they agreed.  When we arrived, the server told us there would be one check per table but that we could each give him the credit card and he would figure it out. He claimed that that was policy, their computer couldn't figure out it per couple, and that our organizer was lying when they said the restaurant agreed to separate checks.  

They didn't staff up for our large group and the poor waiter was extremely busy and dealing with too many tables.   He did not mention the table tip of 18% would be on the total before the happy hour discount.  There was no happy hour menu, nor was this gratutity published.  We have done other group happy hours and we know this is common practice (paying tip on the pre-discount price, and that would be fine.)... however other restaurants have figured out the bills for us.  

The tip on the total would also be fine if he had taken the time to tell each couple what they owed as he had promised.  However he just gave us the bill and we had to figure it out.  The bill was incorrect in that it came in at the total price.  So he redid the bill.  This time it came back with the beer charged at an amount different from the main menu.  He agreed to take off $1 from the total but never did. A person in our group carefully computed each person's meal plus tax plus 18% tip. 

 The UNDISCOUNTED total for 8 people for happy hour came to $190 (we each had one appetizer and one drink....their prices are high on appetizers... for example a Caprese salad with 3 slices of tomato, 3 slices of mozzarella and a splash of basalmic vinegar was $13.)  Anyway we each paid in, and the total check showed we still owed $10.32.  We asked the waiter to figure it out, he refused.  We recomputed our bill and we said we were right and we wanted to leave.  He said he would call the police (can they call the police if you only leave 9% tip?)  

Then he came back and said HE was the manager but he would "eat" the difference in the tip even though he felt it wasn't fair; which made us feel bad.  Then he went and got the real manager who recomputed the bill and said, yes we were right.  But before he came back we reluctantly paid the waiter/"false manager" the difference so we could leave.  

Our group is from one of the largest neighborhoods in Summerlin.   I will say that this event is ultimately going to cost them a lot of business.  We are not "cheap skates", they only had to explain how to calculate the total.  And we would have done it that way... but we didn't know.  In fact, ultimately I was the one who figured out WHY there might be a difference.  The fact that they advertise "2for1" on drinks but don't say its "per person" and the fact that they don't explain the table tip, and nowhere is it in writing... and then had the nerve to say they would call the police on us for basically reducing the tip for their poor service...  UM, even me, mild mannered me, just couldn't put up with it.

The shrimp and crab appetizer was good, the house wine was mediocre, and the caprese salad was not good (tomatoes were hard, cheese was hard).  The happy hours at other upscale restaurants in Summerlin have been far better (food wise) and less expensive and better staffed for large pre-arranged groups.Used to LOVE this place.. Came 2x and went back for a 3rd and there was a bug in my wine! So upset and disgusted! Seriously.. its so dark in there, i almost swallowed it! I mentioned it to the waiter and he completely dismissed me and did even want to take it off my bill! Really? Come on it was like 5 bucks! He was just so rude about the entire thing. The manager was no better either ugh!

 So disappointed at the way they handled the situation! 

Definately would not be returning EVER!Get it together Jewelers! On top of the DREADFUL experience we had to start with when we made our custom rings before our wedding, now the Jeweler's aren't even sticking to their offered plan to rhodium dip and size for free. After ALL the money we've spent there. But they're also not consistent. My husband went in a month ago and his was free, then I come in and they tell me its $45, but they might be able to get me a deal and charge me only $25. No. It's Free! It should be free, like my husband was told when he FIRST came to The Jewelers and purchased the rings. And just like his father who bought all his mother's jewelry there. It's as if they don't care to have loyal clientele. Is the economy SO good all of a sudden that there's no need to build a rapport with clients. They almost had two generations of a VERY large family as their clients, but no more. I don't even know why I bothered coming back to hold them to their word that they would take care of the ring they made. I feel so let down. I don't even want to buy jewelry anymore.It looked like a cool place to grab a bite, but the looks of the grunge exterior didn't compensate for the lack in quality in the meal.

For a meal that is on average $8-$11  per plate, you would expect it to be 
fresh, but instead it tastes like it was frozen packaged and then baked. 

For example the french fries were the kind you buy in a big buy and can oven at home... at least that's how it looked and tasted 

Second, the Pulled Pork's BBQ tasted off... 
the bun was cold and the coleslaw on the bun didn't make it taste any better 
The bun should have been slightly toasted with butter or mayo, but instead it was cold and plain 
You can go to Vons and buy a pack of pulled pork for that feeds 4 people  that tastes better then theirs...

Unfortunately I was looking forward to eating here, but was greatly disappointed by their quality of food for the price they were asking per plate. 

If you catch the lunch special (ends at 3) then I suppose it would have been comparable to the quality, but other then that, I would never eat here again. 

The entertainment of TVs was nice, but I rather go somewhere that has better food for that price.I had a crazy acne flare up a few years ago.  I researched derms and found a lot of good reviews about Dr. Aspacio.

When he came in to the exam room, he seemed rushed and acted like I was taking up his time by telling him my dermatological history.  I told him that I had tried a certain medication for my acne, but didn't like it because it made my skin raw and peely, and asked if he could make a suggestion for another solution.  So what does he prescribe?  That same medicine I had just told him I didn't want to use again.

Did you not hear what I said 10 seconds ago?  I just said it made my skin RAW!!  When I told him this again, he responded, "Well, you must be applying too much.  It's the gentlest medication there is, so there's nothing else I can give you."  He wrote the prescription and walked out.  I felt so uncomfortable at his chiding and found him to be one of the rudest doctors I've ever experienced.  No one should feel that way when it comes to a professional taking care of your body.  Everyone deserves much more than that.

I took his prescription, threw it out, and found another dermatologist who actually listened to my concerns and cleared my acne with another medication that didn't leave me looking like my face was coming off.In response to the doctors comments...
The reason for the poor rating is because of the rudeness of your staff.  In addition, they were the ones that were wrong with the information they gave me originally.  Also, she did not offer for me to come to the office, that was my idea and she resisted..."she's busy"....again, rude, inconsiderate and poor customer relations.  I still have yet to receive the breakdown of the billing as requested that day.Overrated, from one little issue I had with billing nobody would take responsibility, management don't make any of their employees accountable for their mistakes, and gives you the rounds. Completely unhappy and will not recommend it, stay away from this people. Too bad the building and the area are nice.If I didn't love my kid so much, this place would not be an option. I'm afraid I might have contracted hepatitis from this place. First off, it's a Saturday night. Is it possible to schedule more than 1 person? Waited 15 minutes before anyone came to the counter to take an order for the 20 some people in line. Drink station had more garbage on it than the garbage cans. No ice on either side. Tried to ask an employee, but there were none. Waited 35 minutes for our pizza. Went to the counter and asked how much longer and this girl rolled her eyes and brought out the wrong pizza. She put it on the counter and walked away. Just walked away!!! Asked LUV the manager about the wrong order and he ordered us another pizza which I never received. I was robbed. One bright spot, almost all the games were working!!!!!Was brought into this living hell hole by ambulance. Waited 9 hours for a room in a chair. Nurses in emergency room horrible- too busy to help you with anything, rolled eyes at you if you so much as asked for water. They were in the nurses station having a snack party but couldn't help sick people.  Completely understaffed. Wait time to see a doctor was 17 hours. I have great insurance too. If you don't have insurance they sit you out in the hall and transport you to UMC. I cannot even begin to describe the disgust I felt after the treatment I received by the nurses in this dump.

I actually had to rip out my own IVs and cardiac monitors when it was time to leave. If they told you something would take 5 minutes it would take hours.If I could give this place lower than one star I would!  Here's the story-I'm an out-of-towner suffer an injury and transported by ambulance to this hellhole. I wait on a board for over an hour and 45 minutes - almost peed myself waiting for a nurse to see me - waited forever for a doctor to finally see me and tell me that I had a concussion.  I'm telling you I would've called out on all fours to get out of that place. Not a lot of friendly staff I think my husband encountered two friendly people out of that whole place.  I truly hope that Las Vegas has better medical facilities in this place. Because my advice if you're injured bleeding or need a heart transplant get yourself on a plane and get the heck out of there if this hospital is your only choice.We just ordered our food and had two edible items. The two bags of chips that accompanied our heroes. Meatball parm hero tasted like it had been frozen and thawed a few times. Definitely tasted spoiled and after two bites I threw it out. My husband had the eggplant parm hero and it was pretty much batter, cheese and sauce. The tiramisu was FROZEN!!!  Even if you order your desserts pre-made from Sysco, at least thaw the dang thing first. Not even worth calling back to fix it. Will not order from there again. Didn't try the pizza but no point in that now. Once you bite into spoiled food you're done.I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent.  And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said " I'm going to have to ask the selling agent, I'll get back to you" but he never would. So I finally began contacting the selling agent Jennifer hill who is the 2nd worst realtor ever!. She was very unresponsive never returning my messages. Finally when my purchase agreement expired I quickly canceled my agreement a requested my earnest deposit back which took them weeks to even get them to get the owner to sign (BS).  They gave me the run around constantly and were full of it. If I ever see a property listed under Wardley I will run the other way. Oh ...and Jeff Sommers was of no assistant as well. Wardley real estate is a complete fail.Ordered a ham & pineapple pizza for delivery after hearing good things but was sadly disappointed. The crust was more like cardboard & overall the pie basically tasteless. Hope this was an anomaly but probably won't try again. My guests concurred...If I could give them 0 stars I would. I was referred to them by the guys who work on my truck. They couldn't do the front end alignment themselves. I called, scheduled an appt, and when I got there advised that I need the front end alignment. I also mentioned that I have a vibration that seems to elude everyone and maybe once the alignment was done, if they saw anything to let me know. 

Well that was the wrong thing to say. The guy test drove my truck then proceeded to tell me all the things they THOUGHT were wrong and handed me an estimate for $800.00. Let me preface by saying that Ive been working on my vibration issue over the period of 4 years. I've had more than one  knowledgeable person look at it and they still cannot determine why my truck is not keeping a balance. The Big O rep said that shocks would cure the problem. Really. Not by anyone IVE TALKED TO. I know more about my truck then I ever care to and more than most guys Ive talked to about it. I was told by Big O that I had a bent axle. Toyota said not true and neither did Discount Tire. I will agree that I need a sway bar bracket and I got one of those from Toyota. 

I agree with one other reviewer don't go if your a woman. I guess my being one made this guy think I was dumb enough to buy that estimate and fork over 800.00. 
No alignment was done. The guy told me he would save me the money because he wanted to let me know that there were guys out there that were honest. Oh? Where?So I went to the summerlin quick care 4 times in the past yr since I don't have a regular doctor. The first time I went in for a migraine. The dr said what u want a narcotic is that what u come in here for? I said no I want migraine meds. He told me I need to get a regular dr for that and gave me a script for perks. He treated me like a pill popper tryin to get a fix. The 2nd time minus having a 3 hour wait went much better! The nurse was super nice and the dr was ok. The 3rd time I was in and out in 30 mins and had that same nice nurse again. The dr took his time with me but I would have liked him to tell me how long this bronchitis would last. Now we come 2 my 4th time-today. I went back again because I'm still sick with bronchitis and need something to help. The wait was an hour so not too bad. This time it was a different nurse who was horribly rude with her comments to me. I'm sick have some freaking sympathy don't be a bitch because u want to end Ur work day. She told be to wait the the one room to see if she could find an open exam room. She seriously yelled from down the hall that room 7 was open. Hey she had told me to wait so I didn't move unt she came back to get me. Really Ur going to yell down the hall for me??? Then when the dr came in she was literally with me for 2 mins at the absolute most 3 mins. Keep in mind that included her writing a note to the nurse about what meds to give me. She told me my blood pressure was high and Asked if I was pregnant. I told her no but she asked me another 2times. How about U find out why it's high instead of acting like I'm lying about bein pregnant! And the icing on the cake was that the dr prescribed me medicine that they had prescribed to me 2 weeks earlier that apparently didn't help! Thanks for the horrible treatment and a waste of time and money!! I did give one star because the one nurse was so nice and the ppl at check-in are usually nice as well.Awful.  Waited 2.5 hrs to be seen, only to be dismissed by the condescending excuse for a doctor that previous posters have alluded to.  I only went here because my primary care doctor was unavailable and he told me if symptoms from a preexisting condition returned, seek medical assistance immediately.  After dealing with these recurring issue for almost 8 months, I recognize the symptoms and tried to explain this to the doctor, saying that my regular doctor advised me to get on antibiotics immediately.  She told me it looked like I had a bug bite.  When I told her this had been happening for 8 months with the same symptoms and had been cultured and came back positive within the last 6 weeks, she told me I should stop trying to diagnose myself.  After I had to practically beg for antibiotics, she tried to put me on a pill that I'm highly allergic to, which she would have known had she glanced at the huge capital letters on my chart.  I guess I wasted 2.5 hrs of my time for a 5 minute confrontational exam, but she couldn't take 2.5 seconds to look at my chart.  I told the NP that discharged me that I was unsatisfied with my diagnosis, and she was extremely nice and caring and took the time to listen and suggest options, which the doctor had not.  Thank God for her, I'm sorry she has to work with such a terrible woman.  If their were more doctors like the NP, I'd consider returning.  This place is 30 seconds from my house but I'll drive anywhere else next time.I've been taking my cats to Dr. Steelman for 15 years.  I was always a huge fan of her work in the community.  I am deeply disappointed in my last dealings with that place and Dr. Steelman. My cat was very ill, and you NEVER can reach anyone there. They NEVER return your phone calls. You wait HOURS to pick them up.  Then when you do, if your cat is still sick, and you have questions, THEY STILL DON'T return your calls. HOW SCARY. The receptionist keeps saying we are VERY busy. SO is the VA hospital and people DIE!     If you are VERY BUSY then our poor family members get forgotten.  Vodka Ghilarducci (my 15 year old purr master) pasted away today 5/24/14 of fluid in the lungs and heart.  Rainbow Animal Hospital was able to detect his pain and laboring breathing that was so hard to watch. We chose to do the right thing. I will NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE. After all as they say, "WE ARE VERY VERY BUSY"!!!!!  Keep that in mind when you bring your babies there!

Here is THE CLINC'S MISSION STATEMENT:  WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR CAT IS AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.    How is this EVEN possible when you DON'T call your clients back? How is this possible when you admit to being TOO busy?   Simple common sense say NOT!Not professional at all. Three friends and I walked into the office to get our nails done for a wedding. They were understaffed but seated two of us quickly. When it was my turn, I asked for a french manicure with gel on top- $27. The manicurist's station was FILTHY, with dried nail polish/water/powder all over the place. Stains everywhere! My manicurist kept hollering at her coworkers in whatever language they spoke- ridiculous!! My manicure was interrupted when a woman came in to get her eyebrows done. A friend was tossed around from manicurist to manicurist while getting her full set done. My cuticles weren't trimmed completely. The machine I put my hands inside to cure the nails was nasty, dusty and OILY, like they never clean it. It was just a gross place and I'm never going back there again. My nails began chipping... THE NEXT MORNING. In two days all of my nails were chipped. I hadn't done any manual labor/ hard work- it was just a cheap job. Don't go here!!!!Just finished the Sunday brunch with my mother here, first off we were sat on a tiny table with chairs that were not even on the ground. Our waiter was rude and the food was sub par for the price. 
 I was very disappointed as I have eaten at this restaurant a couple of times before and had a great experience, not quite sure what has happened here.The Worst Ever!!!  No star rating bc they dont deserve any stars... 

My car broke down while i was on vacation in Vegas and only auto repair open was Pep Boys went to go get a diagnostic as they call it & they almost made me have a heart attack! Their diagnose was that my engine was blown & either I needed to replace engine or just junk it! I was devastated of course... and I'm like it's just leaking water & it overheated!!! Their quote to fix it was $8K for a new engine, block, gaskets and blah blah. They said, you can't drive back to LA you will never make it. I left almost in tears & of course I was in panic mode. BUT my family in Vegas got a friend mechanic to check my car and after being under the hood for 5houors (not 10 minutes like Pep Boys)  guess what??!!! It was only a seal that was cracked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My cars' engine is fine!!!! And it was only $120 to fix it. AND I made it safely back to LA w/o a problem. So FU PEP BOYS!!!! I will never ever ever go back there.  BTW, while i was there i did check out there tires and their pricing is RIDICOLOUS!!!  They are SCAM ARTISTS!!!Tan Factory... Oh man where to begin. Anyone on yelp with reviews about their packages are NOT LYING. And anyone reviewing the company well must be lying. Now location to location you'll get different staff, which is the only positive remark ill make in this entire review following that the people who work at the charleston location I just adored. They were clean and prompt.. Most of the time. 

They don't try heavily to upsell the products, which was nice considering for unlimited tanning you're already looking at a price of around $100. I'm not a serious tanner but was looking for a good salon since I'd just moved here from SF and was applying to jobs and hitting the end of the pool party season. 

The groupon I started with was fair, $25 for 2 spray tans or 2 bed sessions, which you had to specify one or the other, not interchangeable. But problem #1 I came to find I couldn't use two $25 two-spray coupons because they were one per customer to start. Well OKAY I guess, so I gave the other one to my boyfriend for when he'd visit. Mind you they had a 4-bed session $50-some groupon, but not a larger spray package for the same.

So by the end of my groupon they convinced me as a groupon customer I'd only pay $94 for unlimited. I signed a contract and the young lady warned me that by signing I'd be promising a minimum of two months before I could cancel, and I said that was okay. Through December and January I was a tan and happy camper. 

Once end of January rolled around, however, holiday pay had ended at my job and hours got cut like crazy. I knew I wasn't going to be able to afford my package till closer to summer when hours would come back around. My last day of tanning for the month of january, I told the boy at the counter, who had informed me he was new (I asked since I'd never seen him among the other TF associates) that I wasn't going to be able to afford the package anymore and I wanted to cancel. As I left I double checked with him that he understood what I needed from him, and he agreed and waved me goodbye. What a relief I thought, and I'd see them in a few months (tear).

Around the end of May my credit card was reflecting numerous charges from something I'd never heard of, BodyHeat tanning, and I was extremely puzzled. I went back a couple months and saw I'd gotten a charge of $5.50 for the months of February and March, stated as "TANFACTORY BODYHE LAS VEGAS NV" so I put it together and read these other reviews stating their name change. So what made it okay for them to charge two months of $5.50, noneless I got the full package charge of $94 for all of April and May! I hadn't gone since January 29th, and they scan your finger to attach to your account. So there is proof I hadn't gone in forever. I call the charleston store and they tell me to call corporate. Of course it's a holiday weekend and a Saturday nonetheless so I had to wait until today, inching days closer to June where another month will be charged. I left a voicemail with billing, no call returned.

So today I've now had to call billing back (THIS IS THE BEST PART) who tells me you need to petition by email or fax to get yourself unsigned with the company... BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE! I ask her where this is stated and she says in the contract I signed half a year ago. So not only have I been charged $300 for not showing up somewhere, but no one, including the young man at the counter, the manager, nor the girl who signed me up, told me this ONCE. So thank you Tanl Factory, or BodyHeat, or whoever the hell you guys are, for sucking us into this nonsense.

Now maybe I should've read the fine print and asked more questions before signing, but as someone who works in retail opening credit accounts through an outside company my CUSTOMER SERVICE knowledge pushes me to discuss the pamphlet we give to new account holders, nonetheless I urge customers to read it as give them a quick brief on what to expect, such as our extremely high interest rate and the issues that come with revolving accounts.

So point being that though the staff is friendly and kind and the place is kept clean (what more do they have to do besides sit on their phones at the desk), the customer service regarding these death contracts are just not worth it in the long run unless you're tanorexic and come enough and you have a extremely steady job to support this madness. You'd think with so much time on their hands they'd explain the fine print. You'd have a better shot elsewhere my fellow yelpers, and mind you I don't write negative reviews EVER. I prefer to praise a company rather than write a bad review, but I've had just enough of this BS.All my food was cold. Got a number 7 with tots and a coney. Ate it in the car and it all tasted like yesterday's left overs. Just plain Horrible.If you specifically request guacamole and they charge you the extra "fee" for it, then they should put it on your damn burrito...  They even forgot the mild salsa.    First and last time eating at Baja Fresh.  Should have made the drive to Chipotle.FALSE ADVERTISING!  According to the news paper they serve food 24 hrs a day, this is also posted on their front door as well as a big sign on the building.
We went there only to find out that the kitchen doesn't open until 11:00 a.m.I was craving Filipino food so this place was the closest place to where I was at. When I walked in I saw only 4 items available. Looks like the 4 items were sitting there for a long time. I ended up leaving without ordering anything. I went to another Filipino place downtown.Clean your bathroom!!  
P.S.  you sell food cleanliness is a good thingFiesta, with a name like that, you'd think this place would be more of a blast. It should be renamed Siesta. 

This place is gross. No other way to put it. A casino that looks well past it's age. The Fiesta is home to a stagnant, stale scent of cigarettes, a buffet (which may be the grossest place you'll ever eat in your life), a Denny's, Club Tequila, a Mexican restaurant, and an ice skating rink.

Part of Station Casinos, this place must be the blacksheep of their properties. I don't recommend staying here, playing here, or eating here. There are decent acts playing at Club Tequila and who doesn't like making a fool of themselves on the ice.So where do I begin... I wanted to surprise my wife tonight, so I called to book a room. I usually play paigow here and just wanted to get away from home, so I figured this would be a quick get away.

1) I called around 5pm or so to book the room. The lady on the phone asked me if I wanted a king. She also said that I couldn't cancel because it was same day. No problem. I said yes, because that's what I wanted. 

2) She tells me how much it is, and after fees, its just under $100 for the night. No problem, I booked the room.

3) I get there and there are 3 people in front of me, then three more people show up after me and only 1 register open, so I wait almost 30 minutes to check in. Even the people behind me were complaining and I'd been there twice as long as them.

4) I finally get to the counter around 6:20pm and the lady tells me they don't have any kings available and haven't since yesterday. That pisses me off because the lady on the phone told me I was good for a king. Then the lady says that the king is only a "request"... well don't bill my card for a king if its only a request. Say that up front instead of lying to the customer and STEALING their money.

5) So now I can't cancel and we're stuck with a crappy room with 2 full beds instead of a king, like I was told I would have.

Avoid this place. They are liars. Any time you don't disclose that the customer may not actually get what they think they are paying for, it is dishonest. 

On top of that, they have the worst buffet in Vegas. I wouldn't even use my comps to eat there. I'm thoroughly pissed off right now because I'd much rather go somewhere else and actually get what I pay for.

FYI, according to the lady at the counter, they only have 10 kings in the entire hotel,  but you don't find that out until after they lie to you and steal your money.This was the worst experience I have ever had not only with a place to stay, but the customer service as a guest here.

Do. Not. Come. Here. For. Any. Reason. Under. The. Sun.

Why?

Because my boyfriend and I were UNLAWFULLY kicked out and they voided their OWN contract and fine-print that they made us sign/initial!

My boyfriend basically told me Monday morning  (7/22/13) he was going to go to the front office to renew his wifi. When he got there, he spoke to the two same teenage girls that helped us get set-up in the place the previous week.  Come to find out, because of the billing and credit card situation being odd, because of our property manager paying for everything, he wasn't able to renew the wifi for another week at $5 because they were going to have to have the property manager call the front desk to allow them to charge the same credit card.  It was a pain because it is really hard to get a hold of anyone with property management and come to find out, we were staying there for two weeks and they only paid for one!  My boyfriend in pure frustration after hearing this, grabs his phone in anticipation of calling our property manager and mutters to himself "son of a bitch."  That was a statement made TO HIMSELF.  One of the young girls jumped on that, stating, "Excuse me?" My boyfriend immediately came back with, "..What?" because he didn't know what she was talking about. 

Rather than being a stand-up, normal person, she immediately took offense and asked him rudely, "Did you just call me a stupid bitch?" From what my boyfriend told me, he immediately said no, stating he was frustrated at the fact that he had to "call these people again" and apologized for making it seem like he was directly insulting her. Rather than taking the apology, she calls her manager over, acting angry stating my boyfriend called her a stupid bitch.

This is where it all gets very messed up.

This manager decides to go off on my boyfriend totally out of the blue, and I quote from him, "She walks over and starts asking me 'Who do you think you are fucking insulting my employee'", he tells me that again he repeats himself stating it wasn't meant to be an insult and he was cussing to himself. He tried telling her he wasn't threatening her employee and he apologized for the language and she stated "to not use that god damn language in her office". He told her that we hadn't been paying for our room for the past week BECAUSE of the management company, to this she responds, "You don't have to worry about the rent, you need to pack up your shit and go." When he protested, considering that was like an 18-wheeler randomly hitting someone, she pulled out her cellphone and threatened my boyfriend saying she was going to call Metro (the police) on him if he didn't leave immediately. He comes back to our room stating the situation. I, immediately, know it is a miscommunication because I KNOW for a fact my boyfriend does NOT treat anyone so disrespectfully. When I go to speak to this manager face to face, I am treated like shit on her shoe with her telling me I have thirty minutes to pack my "shit" and get out. So, we do. Mind you, my property manager also tried to speak to her via the phone, to no avail! Apparently she's highly offended by cursing in her office - enough to evict someone in half an hour!

We were inside our room with our stuff finally packed to go (waiting for a taxi) when a person with courtesy patrol knocks on the door and tells us that we have to vacate the room because he's locking it up. That to me seemed normal, regardless of the terrible circumstances.  To make it WORSE, after he leaves and we're sitting on the steps with three overly stuffed garbage bags of groceries and stuffed to the brim suitcases, he comes back stating - and I QUOTE - "You must have pissed someone off, because 'they' want you off of the property." My boyfriend and I were SPEECHLESS! We were THROWN TO THE CURB!

We found out later the manager's name is Dana and that this is NOT the first time she has treated people this way. In a few examples (per tripadvisor), people were given a written eviction notice for no reason at all. One person stating, "--New Manager Dana Alexander comes in and makes her own rules. Totally not in the rules and regulations. I thought maybe the corporation might wanna know how bad shes treating the costumers there so I wrote a letter. 3 days after, she brings a 7 day eviction letter." After all of this, we called her district and regional managers and NO ONE even cares! Their excuse was that "they operate as a hotel for the first 30 days" so that, by NV standards, excuses them and makes what she did legal. 

If Dana and those girls read this one day, you are all low down and DO NOT deserve your job! Anyone and everyone headed to this place, RUN FOR THE HILLS! We did NOT deserve to be treated like animals and we did not deserve to be at the mercy of a person that is such a control freak that abuses her power.We arrived at 8:20 for the all you can eat shrimp. When we approached the hostess, she informed us that she would seat us, but they are closing the dining room and we'd be the last customers. I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention.Horrible place to take your children!!! The staff is very rude, to say the least! Management could care less about any complaints and the refs are very strict and unbecoming. Recently a young girl broke her arm because refs allowed kids that they know to skate out of control. I stopped taking my 4 year old here about 8 months ago because of this type of behavior, also since one of the refs that are still currently employed had threatened to fight me in the parking lot, and assumed that it might be different now but was shown the same as before. I will never come to this skating rink again. Hopefully the staff is better at the Boulder Hwy location.I had a very bad experience with my last 3 or 4 encounters with this place. Called to board my animals and was given one price but when I picked up my animals the price was much higher. A few times I made appointments I was asked if it was for a deceased pet that was still in their system even after repeatedly telling them the animal had passed away! Sent one of my animals to get neutered and discussed with the Dr. to remove dew claws while my dog was under. This wasn't done, although later I saw that the Dr. noted it in the chart, and I ended up having to put him under again to do the procedure. Being a long time client (9 years and 6 pets) I thought I should take the time to let the office manager of my problems. She (the Dr.'s wife) was rude, offered no apologies and even told me that I should take the blame for not double, triple checking to make sure I got the right price and the right procedure done! Are you kidding me??? She said she'd never had any complaints to which I told her most people just change vets while I was sincerely trying to bring her attention to customer service issues. FIRED!! Now go to South Shores Animal Hosp. and am VERY happy with their customer service!! 

PS.  I also felt as if I were buying a used car every time I would see Dr. Goldman because he would try to sell me every product that he had on the shelf as if that was his primary source of income!!  Made a vow to spread my horrible experience with this clinic.Justin the bartender was very rude.  This is a low class joint.  Shouldn't male bartenders wear shirts with sleeves?We were really looking forward to our small plane flight over the Grand Canyon yesterday.  The tour company called as we were on the way to the municipal airport to tell us that the flight was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties.  Obviously the airline they contract with doesn't have backup equipment.

This was to be the highlight of our trip to Vegas.  The last minute cancellation didn't allow us an opportunity to plan for anything else, so we went home.  They refunded our money, but ... so what?  They're required by law to do that.

VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTING!it has one star, because its required before i can tell you how HORRIBLE this location is.
OH MY GOD!
its like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!
when i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! 
i ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.
absolutely ridiculous staff!
start hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.
worst KFC, ever!Horrible! The drive thru is just garbage! The lady didn't even ask what kind of chicken we wanted, and we sat in the drive thru for more than 20 mins! No wonder they have only 21/2 stars... They don't deserve even one from me! Why can't we give 0 stars?New owners took over.  The pizza sucks now!Great china wasn't so great. We paid over 40 dollars for food that did not get all of the food and the taste was not good at all. Will stick with china a go goLast time I ordered to go, I got the chow mein noodles instead of fried rice. When I got home, I opened my box to find literally chow mein noodles. No sauce, no veggies, nothing on the noodles. They basically boiled the noodles in water then placed in the box. Okay.... so I went back today. Got the lunch special. The chicken with mixed vegetables was good, but only the vegetables. The chicken was soggy and slimy and just not good. The fried rice was fried rice with egg. No vegetables. The service is also really strange and awkward. Time to find a new restaurant.ANother update at the bottom as the crap thickens...

This is an update of my original post in response to a comment posted to my review from Terry.

Never again...went in for a part and have them verify it was what I thought a discontinued part no one carried. They took it in and 30 mins later tech came out and told me he found my part....for 600 dollars. I paid my service fee and left slightly worried. Took it to my real trusted shop James West Automotive and turns out its not even the part I or Sun Valley said it was...and it was only 100 dollars. 

All these reviews about great smog checks?? Really?  That doesnt make a shop...being correct and not a crook does.

Go ahead and head there if you wish...sure they have Oceanside property in Colorado for you too

Here is the update and response:

Terry I know your shop had been around since I have been coming to it for decades and went to school with Dan.  You were also my trusted shop until this day and went to who could get me in quicker which was yours.

The date of service was 11-1-2011 Invoice Number 51589 time in9:25 time out 10:20. Your typed quote was 596 plus the 46 for the diagnostic. Go ahead and find out the tech that tried to charge me that much for a part that oreilly's and autozone carry for just over a hundred and don't try to tell me the rest was labor as I changed it myself in 20 mins.

Thank you for making your shop look worse.

2nd Update.


Well Terrry 1st off the part was not a cheap part it was from Cardone who has been around almost twice as long as your shop. 2nd the 85% failure rating you gave was a nice number you plucked out of the air..nice try. 3rd. the person running your desk was quite clear that the diagnosis fee was not going to be credited back if I had the work done there as it work already performed. 4th.  I have a solo brake bleeder kit that magnetically sticks to the frame so ya..it is that easy to bleed the brakes but the hour labor was not the issue, the BS markup on the part was. 

Reply with all the lies/excuses  you wish, Yelp is for the people and everyone reading this can see the facts and your several attempts/failures at excusing the BS that occurred that day. 

Take care and I wish you only the bestRude employees and disingenuous advertising.  They claim to be open 7 days a week from 7 AM to Midnight.  I had my car towed in last Saturday around 5:00 PM.  As I was leaving I asked when they would look at it and the front desk guy says they run a skeleton crew on the weekends and should get to it by Sunday morning.  I called back at 9:30 AM Sunday and spoke with the mechcanic Justin.  I asked if had looked at my car and he said no and that he may get to it that evening.  I said "Justin the reason I brought my car to you was that your open on the weekends and I need my car back ASAP".  Justin's response "listen I'll get to it when I get to it and if you can't wait then come and pick up your car", so I did.  I could of had my car towed to a dealer who was going to look at it Monday.    I came to Vegas for the weekend and had no plans on staying till Monday, so I thought these guys advertising they are open on the weekend could take care of my overheating car, but instead they are basically open to take your can in and work on it during the week when they have a full staff.  The salt in the wound was speaking with Justin the Mechanic he was a condescending little punk.  I was not belligerent nor rude to him I just asked him when he was going to look at my car.  

Obviously management has no clue or doesn't care because they either hire rejects or don't train their employees on customer service skills.  More importantly they advertise they are open on the weekend and don't staff accordingly.  AEI'm not a fan of this church.
I went here a long time ago, when I still considered myself a Christian (I don't identify with that label anymore, but I did when I came here).

I came to several services, and was never welcomed. 
I never felt that I was welcome there at all.  No one would verbally say hello.

I personally feel that these HUGE churches are not good...how are you going to have fellowship with people when there is such a huge number of people...its impossible to know if someone is new or not.

Parking was always a nightmare, and the messages seemed kind of canned to me.

but...that being said, I encourage anyone to try it out.  Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean that it won't reach or help you. :)I've been ripped off by this place for a long time. I kept going back because it is so close to home but every single time I felt overcharged and I always promised myself to never go there again. This is the right time, I've been researching a little and I will take my pets somewhere else from now on. 
They all act like car salesman, not the classy ones, but the ones on boulder highway. They push things like crazy, they know you will do anything for your babies because you love them so much but like I said every time there is always regret. Last time I left my dog overnight, a blood and xrays $750. Previous time an advertised $125 dental cleaning became $1200, the most misleading people ever. They called me saying that my dog was under anastasia and I had to spend more than I was initially quoted, like that was a time for me to shop around - ridiculous. But then it was a ton more than they even told me on the phone because they didn't quote the medicine. I really think they should be ashamed of themselves and they need to be exposed and hopefully they will either start being decent or go out of business. Doctors there have 0 compassion  and majority of the people working the front desk are short, no hi or bye, walmart kind of employees.
Never again.This was the worst Panada inside a Vons I have ever seen.  The fried rice seems like it had been sitting there for hours.  There was only 1 egg roll (even though they are supposed to be sold it sets of 2), no wantons and the orange chicken looked like it was made in the morning.  Plus maybe the prices are higher here or they went up, it was over 8 dollars for a 3 entree meal, but I was willing to pay had it not looked so bad.  Pretty sad when frozen chinese food was better looking.Purina One Cat Food (on sale) for $3.00/pound is highway robbery, especially when I can buy the VERY SAME package for $2.00.pound at another popular grocery store, and even cheaper at PetSmart. Where are you getting this catfood from, Kobe Japan? I priced Smirnoff 1.75L exactly 33% more expensive at this Vons than another popular grocery store.

And a note to the store manager: even the employees at Food4Less tuck in their shirts and make eye contact with their customers. Just something to think about when you can't make your monthly sales quota. And by the way, make sure your employees are carding ALL people in the party if they appear to be under the age of 25...the group of high school girls behind me weren't asked for ANY ID, and they bought more alcohol than I could consume in a month!

Holy cow.Wow- I really done with place- I called to make a payment and the lady named Yolanda was rude and she refused my payment( it wasn't late either). She claim she didnt know how to take payment(weird).Due to bad customer service i won't be returning here again.I thought Kimberly Adams was one of the best doctors I've ever had until I got a letter yesterday firing me as her patient. She comes across as smart and interested and for that you overlook the sometimes extremely long wait times. She sent me for a mammogram and part of the scan was unclear so the mammo office wanted me to go back. When I went back, they wanted $380 to do the repeat scan (license to print money, right?) So I said I'd wait for my next free one and told Kimberly Adams what had happened and she didn't seem to have any problem with it while I was in front of her. Then yesterday I got a letter saying I have to find another doctor because I refused to have the follow up mammogram. So beware - if you don't keep her referrals well funded, she'll fire you too. If I could give her no stars, I would.Like people always say I would give zero stars but yelp forces me to give one star. I had an appointment with Dr. Adams three weeks ago. I looked on yelp to see the reviews and saw that the number one complaint was the wait time and let me tell you YES plan on at least a three hour appointment. I arrived for my 1pm appointment 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork, big mistake since I had a whole hour and half before I even was called back for my vitals to be taken. In that hour and half wait time I spoke with another patient who said that this is ALWAYS the case. As soon as a sat down another person walked in for her 1pm appointment. Fantastic!!!! So double booking appointments. Apparently the staff and the doctor are well aware of this problem but nothing is being done to fix this problem. When I was finally seen by Dr. Adams and told her about my medical history the first thing she offered for a solution was a medical marijuana license. Wtf?!?? Are you kidding me? If I wanted that it thought I need that I would have called Dr, Reefer's number from the signs off the 15 freeway not wait for almost two hours for my 1pm appointment. So she decides to run a full blood panel (can't wait for the bill on that one). It's been three weeks now and haven't heard a peep, so I call this morning to see if I can talk to her or at least get my lab results. "She's out of town" says the office assistance "and if you want to talk to her it's best to make an appointment." I explain I work two jobs, one if then being owning a hair salon and I don't have time to make an "appointment" and wait to be seen three hours later. Her response "well she has a busy practice and that's what all our patients complain about." Again WTF?!? So Dr. Adams why are you still over booking, taking new patients, when you know this is a problem, and why should I have to take time out of my day, not book my clients and lose out on money to pay you to sit there for ours all to ask you one question? It seems you may have your priorities messed up. And as far as my lab results go which she seemed to be extremely concerned about, the receptionist explained that they just came in only on the 17th, that was 8 days ago lady. Stop making excuses for your lack of care for your patients!!! I will not be returning to your crappy practice. This doctor and her staff are horrible and just care about jamming as many clients in a day as possible to squeeze out as much money as they can.  Shame on your Dr. Adams wasn't there an oath you took when you became a doctor!!!Under no circumstances do you ever want to set foot in here.  See all of the other yelps about this establishment.  They are consistently true.  If I could give zero stars, I would.

While I am sure that Dr. Adams is a fine doctor, you can't get past the complete and utter incompetency of the staff.

Let me share with you the issues.  I arrived for my one and only visit 15 minutes early.  No one had called my insurance to get pre-approval.  So, I waited.....  Once that was cleared up, I witnessed two people who showed up after my copayment was paid, get called in.  I was starting to get really upset.  The PA/nurse (whatever) asked me how long I had been waiting.  Answer: over an hour.  She went to the front and discovered that the front desk staff crossed me off as already have been seen.  

I had a bunch of questions about a variety of issues.  Since it was the first time I had seen her, she asked me to have my blood work done.  I received several referrals and a prescription.

First issue, NEVER was I contacted with the results of my mammogram.  If I hadn't had the referral to the cancer doctor, I would have never known the screening was fine.  Never heard about the results of my blood work, other than the $500 bill I received from Quest.  

Then the pièce de résistance was the bill where my insurance paid zero because it was run as a preventive appointment rather than the sick/ill appointment the doctor promised me that she would run it as.  As soon as I received the EOB, I emailed her office, thinking that was the best way to get a hold of them.  FORGET this, they have since dropped the email address which is still listed on the website, as clearly no one bothers to check it.

Now, I have been sent to collections for a bill that my insurance company would have paid, had the office properly billed it in the first place.  When I wrote a letter to the doctor's office that I received a call from a collection agency, asking whether it was ever billed again as a sick visit, the collection agency called me back and wanted to read the letter to me over the phone.  Apparently, the office never had contact with me again.  Which is odd, considering that I felt that at a minimum, I should receive a copy of the blood work documents that cost me $500, so I spoke with a genius front desk person who violated HIPAA and discussed the results over the phone without verifying who I was.  

Now, let me tell you a few morsels of information of the variety of ways that they screwed my husband, who went there based on my recommendation before I knew how truly incompetent her staff was.  He also had a variety of issues that needed to be addressed.  He was waiting at the cardiologist for three hours while her staff promised to send over the results of his EKG.  Finally, the cardiologist was so upset, he got on the phone himself and demanded to speak with Dr. Adams, herself, and demanded the results otherwise, he was not getting off the phone.  (This, of course, come after the fact that her office had over a week of notice prior to this appointment.  They called five times before husband arrived and while he was there prior to doctor to doctor contact.)  He was also left waiting for hours.  And finally, her office does not take personal checks.  So, what exactly are you supposed to do when they screw up and need to bill you afterwards?  You need to call during business hours to give the billing person your credit card number.

Don't you feel safe giving the credit card number to someone who can't be bothered with processing a claim properly?  No, me either.

Run, do not walk, away from this establishment.I frequent El Burrito because I love the food they serve, however, after time after time of HORRIBLE service I refuse to go back. Every single time I've been to This restaurant it takes a minimum of 15-20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and usually there's only 1 other table occupied in the restaurant. I once waited 45 minutes to receive my check while a waitress sat down at a table and decided to watch American idol auditions. The last straw? I went last week, left a tip on my card. And I just looked on my bank account, they added an extra 2 cents on to my tip. I specifically left a total of $30.00 and it was very legible , no room for question. And they had the nerve to add extra money? Absolutely ridiculous. This place should be shut down. I once heard the owner yelling at the cooks in the back saying he wasn't going to pay them that day. This place is a joke.Has the Gyro and the stuffed grape leaves. The gyro meat was dry. The sandwich is made with flatbread and wrapped rather than with a pita. The sandwich was almost tasteless. 

The stuffed grape leaves were old. They were sour. I told the manager and he said that they we fine. I only ate one and threw the rest out. 

I am not sure based on this visit why they are still open. 

I will not be backSo was looking for a different Greek food place since I just moved to summerlin area. Gyro Time is super close and good but wanted a different option. After searching Sultans Grill came up and had fairly good reviews. Being it was getting close to their closing time of "9pm" I headed out and rushed over showing up 8:45. When entered placed was empty and there was a lady and guy in kitchen, As walked in I said hello, and got an immediate response of "we're closed!" No hello or sorry, just we're closed. So I mention well on your door it's says your open til 9pm? And then got the response of "we're put of food!" (With a little bit of attitude). Being how that situation should of been handle differently being that I am in the service industry, I will never go there again and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away from the extremely rude staff their.This place is a joke--------------------It used to be pretty good, but now everything is run down or broken.  I complained to one of the workers and he agreeded.I seriously dont understand how you can do an excellent job on an oil change and then completely fuck up my car when they washed it. Theres nothing but a bunch of teenagers that work here and they can give a shit less about you or your car. I had a dirt smudge on the roof of my car by the sunroof and  instead of just wiping it down clean, i see what looks like to be car keys scratch marks on my car, are you kidding me.I had a terrible experience last night with a cashier. I went to purchase beer at the age of 32, i was with my son and was told i cannot buy alcohol due to him being present. The girl was rude, out of order and a complete bitch. Last time I shop here.Referred by a friend.  Called to make an appointment. ALWAYS long wait times over the phone, all day. Came in here for routine check up and screening and flu shot and prescription.  Only seen the nurse practitioner. Never saw the doctor.  She told me she would get back to me with results either way.  The visit was pleasant.  This was Oct 21.  Fast forward it is now Nov 25. I called a week ago because my prescription isn't covered under my insurance pending doctor's prior authorization.  Made AT LEAST 5 calls regarding this (no exaggeration). All long call wait times, not always given a call back.  I asked for my results out of curiosity only because I already have them on the phone. Only to find apparently the lab never gave them results.  They left me a voicemail to call back by 5pm.  I made a call back at 4:30 and he was on break, they told me to call back.  4:45 and I just get sent directly to voicemail. The following day 9:30am he is also busy and I am told to call back (all calls long wait times.) Finally it is 2pm and I get results that require a follow up?!   Had I not requested the results I would never have known.  One month later, at my request, after 2 days  (after I request) waiting time, I get information that I need.  UNACCEPTABLE.  So I call the specialist they referred and my follow up appt is DEC EIGHTEEN!   On top of that I call again today.  It was necessary for them to give me a call back (of course.) Low and behold I am still waiting for prior authorization on a time sensitive prescription.  I am really upset, frustrated, and do not feel well cared for.About a month or so after canceling the ultrasound with this place (they wanted to charge me out of pocket $450), I went to my normal doctor and did an ultrasound for $77 - to which was completely normal.  Then I received a generic letter from the doctor I saw and it claims that because I have unfinished medical concerns, there may be possibility of health issues INCLUDING DEATH.  I could not believe it.  Who sends letters like that?!!Be prepared to wait at least an hour in the waiting room and another hour in the doctors room. I gave them a second chance and still waited 2 hours. And they have the nerve to charge you for missing an appointment?!?This place is the worst place ive ever been to, EVER! Ive only been here once for a normal yearly visit and I keep getting a bill because they some how managed to have coded quest diagnostic with a experimental code? My insurance doesn't cover experiments and I received a $500 bill!  Now here's the best part apparently they did an experiment with blood work imagine, I dont know where the blood came from because it didnt belong to me? They never took blood that day. And this all happened in dec 2013 well its almost july 2014 and duh! Its still not fixed. This place sucks! Id be afraid they might lose my baby or something crazy id never trust this place with something so valuable as another life!Took my little one to see Dr. Laura today, after waiting for 1 hour in the waiting room and another one in the examination room, I decided to open the door because the room was getting hot a rude nurse told me that I needed to keep the door closed, so I asked her if Dr. Laura was going to take longer? She replied that she had 2 more kids to see before us, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that we had been waiting for a long time or at least said Dr. will be here shortly, nothing... Plain rude lady, so after 2 hours and 23 minutes the dr. finally comes in the room and spent a  total of 9 minutes with us!!! She didn't give us any medicine, just the good ole' Tylenol over the counter, I went to the check out desk to deal with another no-manners-whatsoever employee, but at this point didn't even surprise me. We don't need this, for the money that they charge and the amount of employees they have the customer service should be pristine, and from the doctor, after waiting for her for 2+ hours, she should show at least a little interest on the little patient. Kids are kids and is hard to keep them entertained for that long of a time, especially when they are not feeling great. If I could give this place a minus star rating, I would have done it in a heartbeat. As a parent I can only recommend you to stay clear from this place.I don't get how this place is ranked so high on Yelp! We chose KJ Kitchen based on Yelp ratings- GET IT TOGETHER LAS VEGAS! THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! We will not be returning to KJ Kitchen.

Usually I can overlook bad service for great food, but the meat was rubbery, slimy and flavorless on all dishes we ordered. The dishes were very unflavorful in general. 

The service was worse than the food, I had to like turn around and wave to summon our waiter whenever we needed something (and we are not at all needy) I only summoned 3 times, once to get him to come take our order after sitting there for 15 minutes, another to ask for utensils and rice after our dishes were dropped off and he took off running, and then again 15 mins after we were done and dishes cleared to ask for a check. It was awful!As I walked in the store NO ONE greeted me in fact no one spoke to me. Then about 7 mins. later the guy asked if I needed any help. And, Tara started to help me then got tied up on phone for about 20 mins. so I cont. to look around on my own then finally she help me get a few dress and I started to try them on Tara says, " I'm going to get some clips" and NEVER come back and even to check up on me. So I just walked out and again NO ONE says anything to me not even " Have a Nice Day".  I WIL NEVER GO BACK.I have a problem with the title on the car I purchased from Cadillac and I've called them many many many times to get the problem solved. Each person I talk to passes the problem on to a Sales Manager. But here is never a Sales Manager there that I can speak with and he or she won't return my call. I guess Customer Service ends the minute the car rolls off their lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So, after almost 3 hours and spending over $100.00, we were told by our server in the bar, the "regulars" thot we were too loud!  There were maybe 5 people other than our party in the bar, 3 of t hem were alone & playing at the video poker machine.   It's a bar!  Then, when i called to speak with the manager to advise what my feelings were, he stated he would make the regional manager aware of the situation, since she was "right there" & they would contact me.  Still waiting!We waited 20 minutes for a waiter to attend to us. There were only 3 tables occupied for goodness sake. If only the overly distracted Chef said something or the hyperactive old female waiter sent another server. This place wouldn't get 1 star. WE WALKED OUT.We chose Hooter's because we and 24 others were driving from SF to Las Vegas with classic hot rods in tow for a car show in Vegas, and Hooters was the only place that guaranteed us rooms together. Too bad they lied and our group was all over the place.

Wish that was the worst of it, but no. The worst was the raw sewage they pumped out of the place 20 feet from the rooms. The putrid stench got into every pore and was the most disgusting thing you could ever imagine. Vomitting for all the wrong reasons makes this place a health hazard.

Then there were the elevators that left you out on the wrong floor, that is, if they happened to be working at all.  It was a guessing game because Hooters never put an out of order sign up. Wanna guess how long it took to get up to your room since only 1 elevator was serving 18 floors of rooms in the Bayview Tower?

Taking a shower was a hoot too. About every 40 seconds you would get blasted with a scalding shot of hot water, or an absolutely freezing shower of water. It turns out this is a long term problem they have known about, but refuse to fix. (That goes for the elevators and raw sewage issues too. They know, they just won't fix it.)

Hotels I have stayed at in 3rd world countries haven't been this awful. To think this is an experience out of Las Vegas, NV is unimaginable.

.Damn you, Priceline!

Don't get me wrong, I love a good Priceline deal.  Most hotels I found through Priceline have been cheap and better than expected.    However, in this case, my experience was a big fat disappointment.  It is partially my fault, because I failed to read the disclaimers.  You see, about 12 months ago, Priceline changed their hotel "zones" from "North Strip" to "North Strip & Vicinity" and from "South Strip" to "South Strip & Vicinity."  Oh boy.

The last two times I was in Vegas (Final Four Weekend and Kentucky Derby Weekend), I was unfortunate enough to have been relegated to the "vicinity."  I am talking about Hooters Hotel and Casino, formerly known as San Remo Hotel.  The Hootel, as I like to call it, is located just behind Tropicana and just across the street from MGM Grand.  The location is really not that bad.  Besides, I only paid $69/night, which my friends found to be hilarious in itself.

However, was it a good value?  NO!!!!

The Hootel is worse than you can imagine.  Only one of the two elevators in our tower worked.  The Hootel seemed to have a shortage of hand towels and regular sized towels.  When we called housekeeping, they promptly brought us more bath towels.  Hmmm.  The towels weren't even all that white.  Hmmm again.  The latch on my balcony door wasn't working.  Hmmm one more time.  The walls are paper thin, so you can hear a lot of what's going on in the adjacent rooms.  Hmmm and shrug.  We stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the "no smoking" designation must have included tobacco only, because the distinct smell of marijuana emanated from the hallway (I am talking to you, obnoxious guests in Room 1008).  Hmmm and sniff-sniff.

The room itself is a sight to see.  It's not your average Zach and Cody's suite at the Tipton Hotel.  It's more like Hannah Montana's after-school Malibu hangout . . .  if she and her friends wore orange shorts and served you beer and chicken wings.  (OK, even I don't know where this analogy came from).

Have you ever dreamed of having your own Hooters Restaurant in your house, without the women or chicken wings?  Well, your fantasy is realized right here, in your very own Hooters hotel room.  Your room decor will feature tables and backboards made of unfinished wood, bright orange lampshades, a painting of a Hooters restaurant on the wall, a fake palm tree, and ... an orange bar stool and a bar table right in your room!!!  Score!

Unfortunately, no amount of orange decorations could make up for the white trash appeal of this hotel.  The clientele of this Hootel is unbelievably white trash.  Never in my life have I seen so many Harley Davidson and Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts on a casino floor.  Every group of frat boys checking in had a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon or Bud in tow.  Women had questionable tattoos and wore Daisy Duke shorts.  Casino featured neon lights and an original Alan Kulwicki's NASCAR vehicle.  I kept hearing Jeff Foxworthy's "You might be a redneck if . . . " routine in my head.  'Nuff said.

I love a good bargain, but this isn't it.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10-30 a night on a real hotel room.  I am never staying here again, EVER.Hooters is a crappy hotel! The wings aren't even that great! Try Terrible's wings (see my review) and you'll be glad you did. The hotel looks cheesy on the outside & is just as cheesy on the inside. They try to sucker people in with the Hooter girls as dealers & waitresses bending and giving everyone a peek at their business. Big deal! You can see that sh!t from thousands of chicks on the strip....not to stray but have you seen the way most chicks are dressing in Vegas these days! Yikes! It's gotten so that you can't tell which ones are the "working girls" and which ones are the visitors. But anyway, back to hooters schemes to get'cha in to their casino. $100 free slot play! You see it all over Vegas..on cabs, billboards, etc. I guess it worked on us because we went here for that reason and that reason alone (probably not for the males in our party though who were finally more than willing to go!)! Do I smell something fishy, and I don't mean the females here, or what?! Waste of time? YES! You sign up for the players card and then you MUST play at the 12 designated machines they have for this "$100 free play" promo. Then you play the hundred in $2 slots & if you win you can't keep the money! Only if the money reaches over 2400 (or something like that) in credits. Then you get an amazing $50! Don't waste your freaking time! That money flies in like 2 minutes. Spend your time and money going to a better casino!!! And fellas, if T & A is what you seek than tour the strip! Seriously.Hmmm, how to start this one off. Nasty, dirty, smelly, sleazy, grimy, ugly, depressing,..Not sure. Did I mention dirty? I'll start with that. We could tell from the tiny garage that this place was not frequented for a reason. It is just the epitome of sleaziness. But it's not even up to sleazy Vegas standards. In fact, I'll go ahead and say it, this place should be on the lower end of Fremont st. We got in the elevator and a friend had to hold her nose and breath into her hand so she didn't throw up. And this was on the way to get some of their "world famous chicken wings". Needless to say, we never got those wings (see previous review of restaurant). This place was so depressing and just drained our spirits. We had to escape. There is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there. Just stay away. For the price there are so much better things. BTW, In N Out down past UNLV or in the other direction across the 15!Worst place to stay at.  Very dirtyThis review is for the restaurant only.  Crappy service, same food you can get at any other Hooter's restaurant, just 50% higher price.  Go if you want the food you're used to but be prepared to pay extra and don't expect service anywhere close to any other Hooter's restaurant.  

I also have to say that the waitresses in this location are sub par in the looks department.  Don't expect eye candy.

Regarding the hotel and casino, they are both shit holes.  I do like going to the bar to grab some $1.50 Bud and Bud Light bottles, but that's as far as I ever get in this place.  Great service at bar and super cheap beers.BED BUGS!!!!!

Two words that accurately describe Hooters!  I still have the marks to prove it!  Still itching after my horrible stay!

I came to Vegas to attend a convention at the MGM and Hooters was inexpensive and convenient since I can walk across the street to MGM for my workshops.  After the first night of staying at Hooters, I went to my workshop and was scratching throughout the day.  Another night's stay at Hooters and it got worse.  The room we stayed in was infested with bed bugs.  We were on the 12th floor.

We called them to complain and apparently Hooters knew they had bed bugs on the 7th floor.  Apparently they didn't know they also had them on the 12th.  You'd think if they knew they had bugs on the 7th, they'd really try hard to make sure none of the other floors were infested.

They were in my suitcase (don't EVER leave your case on the floor) and clothes.  I had to decontaminate everything including washing out my suitcase.  They little buggers hide in cracks and crevices and I had to make sure none of them hitched a ride home or my house would be infested.

Yes Hooters was inexpensive and convenient but NEVER NEVER will I stay at this place.  I'm seriously still itching from the scratches.  My right arm had a total of 11 bites.  My left arm had a total of 7.  My right leg had 5.  My left leg 3.  Back five.  Face, one.

DISGUSTING!!!!REVIEW FOR $.25 WING DEAL ONLY. TERRIBLE!! These wings were not the same Hooters wings you get at a Hooters restaurant. Don't be fooled. You must order in multiples of 10 and order a soda or budlight beer which is $1.50. I ordered 10 medium wings. They tasted stale and there was absolutely no flavor. If you want some flavor order the hot, which were more like a mild. Ranch or blue cheese on the side was $1 extra. Totally not worth the 30 minute wait or the horrible/slow service. If these were the same delish Hooters wings that you get at the actual Hooters restaurant, then I would say it's an amazing deal but in this case you get what you pay for.ewSeriously. I don't go to Hooters all that often, but when I do, they have a gimmick to adhere too! The normally friendly waitresses I'm used to see around where just a sham here. Very poor service. I definitely don't come here for the food! Ours completely ignored us and was a struggle to get anyone to help us. Wasn't like I was being out of control drunk (I didn't even drink alcohol, just wanted a snack and a friend was staying at the hotel). I'm sure the girls have to deal with the local or visiting normal douche bags that come in there (the clientele was very suspect), but come on, I gave you all 2, 3, 4, 5 chances.....sorely disappointed and by the looks of other reviews, I'm not the only one. As one previous reviewer said "Come on, its Vegas!". Totally. Should really step this one up. I'm sure they're getting by on name brand recognition and reputation from the logo than what this place gives out.

HOWEVER - If you're looking for a cheap hotel (as in inexpensive both for the basic room and basic floor), then you've found your place. I have friends that stay here for the price and location and they love it. No extra frills. Basic. Not one of my personal favorites, but if you're looking for this place, then it's there for you and probably would rate this much higher. Not a favorite of mine personally.DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. Rates are cheap for very good reasons. For example: furniture missing from room, air conditioning inoperative (in 100+ degree heat). No hot water in room for hours. You get what you pay for. Stay away from this hotel.Hello everyone, 

I had to create a Yelp account just to inform people how HORRIBLE this hotel really is. Where to start. We got in on a Friday, when we got to the room it smelled horrible. The TP holder was under the sink in the corner with TP rolls sitting on the counter. They must of been to lazy to pick it up and put it back. After I fixed that I sat down to relax and watch some TV.. Well that was a JOKE! I turned on the TV and every channel was staticky and couldn't watch... Yes, I had a nice view of the pool. But as I opened the sliding door to the balcony (which you could only take one step out on and no room to move) the door almost FELL off. I had to catch it before it went over the railing...... The carpets were filthy!! Location SUCKS! After the horrible weekend at hooters I was so glad to get home to a nice clean environment.. I get a call from hooters saying we got charged an extra $300 for the "Damages" . WORST HOTEL EVER DO NOT STAY HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND UPGRADE TO THE MOTEL 6 NEXT DOOR.No wifi, really??  The internet in the room was not even workingHoles in bedroom walls dirty bathrooms. Fun to visit, not to stay! With so many casinos to stay in Vegas, it won't cost much to stay somewhere else.It's my first night here and if it wasn't for the Country Music Awards I would not be staying here!
The room is extremely dated, the beds are bowed in the middle, the TV has snow on 1/2 the channels. The room actually stinks so bad that I may not make it! (Covered in perfume or something)
We ate dinner in the Hooters Restaurant and I will say that it was horrible!  The service was bad, the hostess was horrible!  When we left there were 25 people in line waiting to get a table when half the restaurant was empty!  (This was at 8:15pm)
I can honestly say, I will never come here again!This place smells like ass and I don't think anyone ever fixes anything that's broken there.  Or cleans anything. Stay away.So we have been here for about 35 minutes and we have not even receive water, there not even pack and the waitress seem like they are just lounging around. So rude.Never again!!! This is Hooters so I knew it would be bad, but I never thought it would be this disgusting. We found a deal on Vegas.com and we needed a room for just one night. Rooms are from the 80's. Sink would not drain, yay for brushing your teeth in the shower! Shower drained very slowly. Large greasy handprint on the headboard. They claimed it was a no smoking room yet it reeked of old cigs and the carpet was full of burn marks. The A/C unit was so loud it sounded like a freight train, then suddenly it started to smell and we literally thought it was catching on fire!!!! Pool was closed until further notice. We complained and they agreed to remove the $14 resort fee. Do yourself a favor, pay the extra money and stay at a nicer place on the strip. We couldn't wait to get home and shower!!!Been there twice, try their Bun Bo Hue,  the size is small and expensive. poor service. other pho downstreet is even better and cheapper.Went to eat yesterday with my mom and sister. My sister order some pho and found a roach in her soup. Asked to speck to the owner or manager whoever he was. Anyway told him about it and he didn't even care about the situation and still charged us for the soup. Told him we're gonna report u guys to the health department. You know what he said "Do whatever you want. I don't care." Yup we did already. End of story.This bar is the Sunday home to Las Vegas fans of the Cleveland Browns.  That's appropriate because like the team and the city it represents, the Kopper Keg is absolutely dismal. (I say this as a native of Cleveland who escaped many years ago The stench of stale smoke permeates everything, including the "non-smoking" dining area.  The service is virtually non-existent, which almost doesn't matter becasue what they serve you may wish never made it to your table.
Sorry, but I can't think of a single redeeming thing about this run-dwon, filthy "restaurant & lounge".  Maybe they should add a river that catches on fire once in a while, just to complete the genuine Cleveland ambiance.I wish i had the chance to choose which cashier to help me. I always end up with that rude disrespectful Af-Am lady. Too bad i only had few minutes for my break, and it's close to school. I swear i've tried all the fast food chains around CSN.

Okay, let's get straight to the point. I always get the worst customer service EVERYTIME she's the cashier. She shouldn't be there. No smiles, no greet, she just takes orders, tell you how much is the damage and would give you a weird look if you give her exact change.

Recently, i went there again to grab a quick lunch. Same thing did happen! Lol i ordered Mcbites and she forgot to put the sauce in my bag. As i was going through inside my bag, not even knowing something was missing, take note i was holding my bag in my arms, she shoots the sauce inside my bag like a basketball pro and then stares at me like "there's your sauce bitch, you can leave now." Lol it was sorta funny but come on! Say atleast excuse me?

Never heard any word from her besides, "medium or large?"

She needs to go back to training or stay in kitchen.Gave my deposit to a tattoo artist named EZ and they day I showed up for my tattoo, he was a no call no show. He did have my phone number written down so calling or a text shouldn't have been that hard. After talking to several artists who had no idea where he was, one told me his father passed away and she will have him call me. He did call and we rescheduled for 3 weeks later. I show up and again he was a no call no show. Again his father had died. How many times can someone's father die??? So once again someone said he will call me and this time he never did-- and I never got my deposit back.  Supposedly he is part owner of the shop too. Very unprofessional place, poor customer service from the general staff and they steal your deposits.Simply put, if you can't afford to eat at nice buffet and wish to enjoy crab, this is the place. Othewise skip this place since the crab tasted like mash potatos and all though they don't run out of food, the customers grab all they can get as soon as they bring the crab or lobster out.
Food tasted like 2nd or 3rd day left overs and hate to say it. I tend to give great reviews to places that I enjoy and this is not one of them. 
My friend that took me there keep telling me that the food is great for the price and I was thinking well I guess if you are hungry enough, you can eat out of garbage cans and the cost would be great also.
I would not return to this place to eat because I rather eat white rice by itself then the food they serve.

Sorry for the bad review, I'm sure there are tons of people that enjoy the value but once you know what food supposed to taste like, it's hard to go back to this type of buffet.I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the "other" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better.The food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.
Food is bad a year than a year，I never come back！Terrible.  My brother had the flu, fever for a few days with cough, painful joints, etc.  I started showing symptoms of coughing, tingly throat, and chills.  I went into this office hoping for a correct diagnosis of flu virus and possibly getting antiviral prescription (which work best within first 48 hours).  They didn't test me at all for viral or bacterial infection and sent me home with an antibiotic and prescription of coughing meds.  6 hours later, I have 103 fever.  Thanks for worthless waste of my time.  I could have used it to rest instead.A friend invited me here to meet up w/ a some friends/swingers couples that he knows.  Upon entering the bar, I was quite unimpressed but I figured that I would make the best of it.

The waitress behind the bar was wearing a flimsy negligee, and when one of the patrons asked if he could get some nuts, she exposed her panties and said "I don't have any nuts" and then she lifted up her shirt and said "I have these though"...I found the experience to be very trashy and tasteless.

Behind us the swingers were in full action as one lady was getting a massage from the front and the back, another lady was playing darts while exposing a nipple, and I kept getting that creepy feeling that were were getting eye-balled as future swingers candidates.

I guess if you're into sports this place might do, but I'm not into sports, swingers or trashy waitresses, so I'll pass!Total RIP OFF! 
Don't go here if you don't want to leave this place with a hole in your bank account and with more repairs necessary after pick up than before.
I am a female and made clear to Paula, the receptionist and her mechanic Jessie, that I do know a little about cars and that I have an idea what my issue was. 2 days later, after they said they needed the take out the engine and many expensive work hours later, I got my car back. It worked for about an hour, then the check engine light came on. That day  I received a phone call from Paula saying that they forgot to install a part....the missing tube was sent to the shop late, yet they released my car. How does that happen. They really need to communicate with each other!!! No apologies or anything, instead Paula told me she could ship it on my cost and charge my credit card.
Since I am from out of town, I had my "professional" Audi mechanic check out the bill and the work they performed on my A4 after my trip....and he was just shaking his head with a deep exhale. First off did they not only break part of a plastic tube, they also charged me double ($30) for coolant. When I picked up the car, I signed the 3 page bill without checking...and I do take full responsibility for that, however non of the mechanics actually came out to explain the work they did.
These guys might just be good enough for an oil change.
With that said....I recommend to everyone to rather get a tow truck than to pull into Ted Wiens!!!Had flowers delivered to my girlfriend for Valentine's day. She works at a casino and I requested that they be delivered direct and they were delivered to the bell desk instead. She was forced to leave her busy work to get the flowers herself! The flowers delivered were NOTHING like what is shown on the website. I could have spent half as much from a different florist for the same quality. The flowers started to wilt after 1 day. Very disappointed and will not use again.Disappointed said he was in service and was not got a 400.00 bill.  Took a co pay and then got an additional bill saying not in network even though specifically asked if they were in network :(.Puke Palace!!!

Advisory: This location ONLY!

I use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan! 

So hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad! 

Ok the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in! 

Not to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work. 

I tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else. 

The second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living! 

After trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large. 

Luckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning! 

*NASTY FOOD 
*OVER PRICED 
*DIRTY AND FILTHY DINE IN 
*DRUGGED OUT EMPLOYEES 

PS: The employees are ALL NASTY and DRUGGED OUT!!! 

I witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails. Also no washing of hands or gloves while touching raw and cooked food. This location seems more of a health department issue than anything else. 

Please if you can avoid eating at THIS Dairy Queen Please avoid it! at all costs!I am guilty of eating at this location from time to time as it is close to my home. 

I have to say I normally like Dairy Queen! It takes me back to the 80's when life was easy breezy! Mmmmm Heath bar blizzard, such a treat! 

Cherry dilly bar, mmmmm yummy! 

My issue and complaint is THIS location only! 

I finally decided to write my review to help others avoid this train wreck of an operation! 

If I can save one person from eating at this location then I have done my duty! 

Food is never made or cooked properly! 

Corn dogs are still frozen in the middle. 

Blizzards have very little mix ins! Always skimpy! If I order a snickers or heath bar blizzard, come on and put some in it! 

Cheeseburger tasted fowl and I can't describe the taste and odor other than the memory of tossing it into a bin labeled TRASH. 

Prices are high for the amount and quality of food you get. 

The wait for food is ridiculous, after visiting a few times and waiting 20 minutes regardless of what I ordered I knew this place had issues. 

I should have never returned after my first visit however I was open at the time to give them another shot. Always a long wait and disappointment in what I ordered. 

This store is clearly a franchise, they are not playing by the rules that is for sure. 

They cut corners beyond reason and it shows in their service and quality. 

The staff at this location leaves a lot to be desired. 

I have cut this location out as an option, it no longer exist to me. 

The drive thru set up is ridiculous. Try driving in an inside circle and talking through a cup and string speaker system. 

Stay away from this location! 

They are only consistent in BAD.

This location has been written off of my list for good!Horrid stay away.  

I don't know why i went to this place after reading the terrible reviews. 

Every bad review was spot on.   This place sucks beyond imagination.

Horrid food, and a staff that is totally out to lunch.CSN can apologize until the day I graduate & it would not make up for the nightmare experience I have had with them since December 2010. I enrolled in classes for Summer 2011, only to have my Financial Aid Requirements say "Reviewed for Eligibility - No" for almost 2 months! I dropped classes for Summer 2011 & registered for Fall 2011. My billing for classes on my account says $3,247.50 for "Non-Resident Tuition"! Are you kidding me, I have lived in Las Vegas for 10 years. I finally got an email back from Elda Chavez telling me that I listed my residency date as March 5, 2011 on my application. Freaking idiots, residency is established 30 days prior to registration. I also had the flipping bill from Summer 2011 & they do not fraudulently bill me for Non-Resident Tuition. I will just end with this....I have a tour of another college set up for tomorrow! Good Luck to those students who decide to stay @ CSN for your college education. Keep in mind CSN, word of mouth is the best form of advertisement. I will let everyone know!Purchased a Groupon for an exam, cleaning and X-ray. Called to schedule and they only had something available about 6 weeks out. So I said Yes and I scheduled the appointment and took the time off work. I show up on the scheduled day after driving 15 miles to get there and they have no appointment for me and tell me they're sorry but I'll have to reschedule. Complete waste of my time and money. Staff had no remorse and acted like it was my fault. Very rude.I requested a quote on a Cannon Patriot P22 and P40 safe.  Their price was several hundred dollars above Cannon's msrp.  When I inquired about this they replied that Cannon was not their primary safe line and they wanted to steer me to another brand.  Buyer beware of this safe dealer.  This business now operates under the name Stanley Security Solutions.Didn't answer the phone the first time. The second time they answered to tell me they were closed, despite me calling at 1pm which is during their business hours.

I'll spend my money else where."Welcome to Big Dogs; where you can eat, drink, smoke and play."

Well, not any more.

Just got the word.  Wiesner Jr is closing the place to focus on brewing beer at the North Rancho location.  I have eaten Walleye at the Sahara location every Friday for 5 years.  I'm going to miss it.  

The beer was my least favorite part of going to Big Dogs.  The Dirty Dog IPA gives me a hangover that I do not get from any other alcohol, except their Jackpot 777!  When reinheitsgebot (Bavarian purity law) gets thrown to the curb you should expect bad things.

Its been real, its been fun, but it hasn't been real fun.Absolutely HORRIBLE!

The worst Dim Sum I have ever hadThis was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently.

We arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. 

They pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at $15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off.

The rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable.

Service was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.Wow I was there a few weeks ago and I didn't feel too well after.   This explains why.

http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Cathay-House-in-Chinatown-261931831.html?lc=SmartWorst Starbucks I have EVER been in! I walked in at 7:10am. There were 6 employees behind the counter and I was the only customer in the building. I walk up to the register area and one employee starts wiping down the espresso machine. She makes eye contact with me then looks away! No hello or anything. Another employee had her back to me the entire time talking to the girl that ignored me, never once turned around! The other 4 employees were playing some kind of game running around laughing and tagging or touching each other behind the counter. After standing there for 2 minutes, (felt like 20!) I asked if I could order a coffee. The girl with her back to me walks to the back room, the girl wiping down the machine turns her back to me, 3 of the 4 playing grab ass start acting like they are putting things away. Finally one of them asks for my order. I order my coffee and move over to the pick up window. The girl puts my coffee up after a few minutes and doesn't say a word. I ask, "is this mine", to which she replies " I guess".
If I didn't need that coffee, I would have just walked out! Avoid this crap box at all costs!!The worst Starbucks I have been to!  I have been here many times and each time it has been bad. The drive thru is horrendous and going inside wasn't much better. We went through the drive thru and had the worst experience. It was at 6pm and there was one car in front of us and it took 17 minutes! We waited and waited the girl have me total attitude when I ordered and huffed and puffed. The guy in front of us apparently wanted to add money to multiple cards and off of multiple credit cards! It took forever and I assume the girl at the window wasn't smart enough to figure it out. We finally got up to the window and I told the girl that I had the January tumbler (I told her this at the ordering thing) FYI the January tumbler gets you one free grande espresso per day. She said ohh and took the cup like I was inconveniencing her. This is your job! Then she said 'ok you owe me $5.79' uh no I don't stupid! I wanted to kill her! I said nope I don't owe you anything I bought this tumbler for that. 

Everyone I have come into contact with at this Starbucks has been rude and slow! I will not return to this Starbucks!!!This place is infamous for having a rude cashier and not having things in stock. Complaints to management here go on deaf ears. I go out of my way to go to the one on Durango cause of so many bad experiences here- this location really gives the brand a bad name!All I wanted was an international phone card. Every Walmart in the country sells them. For some reason this one doesn't. 

After about 10 minutes of looking, I decided to ask a worker working in the electronics departments. I ask him: "Where can I find the phone cards?". He replies: "Uggh?". I ask again: He replies: "What?". I spell it out for him: "P-H-O-N-E C-A-R-D-S". He replies: "Huh?"

I decide to ask another worker next to the paper towels. He replies: "What?". I try again. He replies: "What?" I leave and attempt to ask another worker. 

Now, both these workers were White-American men in their 20s who had southern accents. Yet, for some reason they couldn't communicate using the English language.  I would expect that from recent immigrants, most particularly from all the Russian, Asian and South American immigrants here in LV, but not those guys.. Whats going on here in Las Vegas? No one speaks English anymore, not even the White folks whose families were probably here when the Declaration of Independence was signed! 

For my 3rd attempt I try to ask an African-American worker. I ask him: "Where are the phone cards?". Guess what his answer is? He replies: "WHAT?" I am now extremely irritated. I attempt to ask again, and FINALLY he gives me directions to the department where I can find them. He tells me to go to a particular isle, and then walks off. I then walked over to that isle, and it was the motherf*cking Soda Isle. Now, I was really pissed. 

I then walked over to the supervisor who appeared to have been of Filipino or Chinese descent. I ask her the same question I asked everyone else. Guess what her reply was? No, I really want you to guess what her motherf*cking reply was? "WWHHHHAAATTT???". 

I then went to another supervisor who was of Latino descent. Finally I got a real answer. But, it was a stupid one. She said that Walmart doesn't sell phone cards. Well, I have been buying phone cards from Walmart for the last 5 years, so I think she might have been a little incorrect in her answer. 

It was at this particular time that I blew up. Believe me, I had one of my stereotypical profanity filled violent blowups right next to the customer service booth. 

Ironically, when I am walking out the door I see a badly bent and torn international phone card laying on the floor near the hair saloon. So it proves that they do have them somewhere in the store. 

What is it that causes people here in LV to lose the ability to articulate speech and all verbal language skills? Is it drugs? Is it the intense heat? Is it the poor public schools? Something is causing massive brain damage in this town.Very Misleading advertising - we picked up adiscount coupon from a local hotel that advertised free club rental. When we called, we were told the round was $55.00.  The $55.00 rate quote turned into $110.00 a player because we weren't "local".  We decided to play because our ride had already left  and it looked like a good course from the club house. Unfortunately for us the conditions turned out to be were very marginal (at best) with the front 9 greens in very very poor condition.  When we complained to the course manager afterward about the price he basically implied we were stupid.  I have played many much better designed daily fee courses in much better condition and for far less cost  in resort areas.  The attitude appeared basically that its ok to stick-it to the tourist because they won't be back anyway - well they got that part right at least.  Save your hard earned money and avoid this place.The management is horrible. They say one thing and turns into another. Nothing is ever organized. They let people do anything here. I used to have good neighbors, and now it seems they let anyone live here. People taking parking spots, blasting music late nights and no rules regulated at all except HOA's. Don't move here. I got a good deal on this place and understand now why. Oh and it seems like anyone gets into the place anyways, don't know what the gates are for. Also the security is horrible, only one guy is constant. The other one seems slow. Had a talk with him the other day couple months ago. 5 minutes after i met him I re-entered my complex and he asked me if i lived here. I said yes, and he was like whats my apt. number. Do they drug test these people?Dear God! Where to start? (sigh) I left UNLV after a couple of years. It became an intolerable learning environment. I have absolutely no respect for this school.  My degree is now on hold until I can leave the state.  I don't understand why this school was even built in the first place. It's only here to put money in the state coffers. It's certainly not here to educate anyone. It's just a ghetto diploma-mill. The staff members are indigenous white-trash personnel. The faculty is lousy. Most of the students aren't capable of doing college-level work and the classes are dumbed down to accommodate them. It's not that hard to maintain an "A" average either.  Many of the science majors I've met are functionally illiterate. You would barely hire them to be maids or cabdrivers. This school is only contributing to the dwindling spiral of Las Vegas. It's handing out fraudulent diplomas. These are the kids that are going to be our future leaders. They will be assuming the supervisory, management and executive positions in this town. And they do NOT have the aptitude for it. I sincerely believe that it would be better to close down UNLV  and put those resources into Clark County K-12 instead. In the meantime, the bright students could go to out-of-state, until the  public school system is rebuilt. Then this town might be ready for a "real" university.Everything about this place was terrible. It was 90 degrees inside and smelled like old grease. The woman behind the counter was down right rude to my wife when she asked about portion sizes. I ordered szechuan beef. It was inedible. They turned it into deep fried beef jerky. TERRIBLE. I don't write TERRIBLE very often about restaurants, but there is no getting around it. It was TERRIBLE. The other diners in our party had somewhat better food, but the egg drop soup smelled like CAT PISS and the huge piles of white rice that came with every order were ridiculous. Why not give us less, but make it better. I will never go again and advise you to avoid.I work fairly close to Panera and at first, I was excited to be so nearby, but after all the mediocre experiences and the last nail in the coffin, I won't be returning here.
I've always felt that the customer service here has been sub-par to the service I have received at most other Panera locations. Most associates have either seemed bored or snarky. But I can overlook this most times as long as I receive tasty food and drinks at a timely fashion.
This certainly did not happen on Valentines day, when I decided to use the very last bit of money I had to treat myself and get a Cappuccino. I had thought about stopping off at the McDonalds near my house, but I dislike Mickey Ds and wanted to use my money on something that I would enjoy.
When I walked in.....there was one cashier and many many customers. And about 5 employees scrambling around behind the cashier to get pastries for people (strange logic).
After waiting patiently for my turn for 10 minutes, I ordered a cappuccino with some sugar free vanilla syrup from a guy who acted a little short with me. Then I waited another 5 minutes for my drink and when the guy handed me my drink, I knew immediately that something was wrong because the cup had no weight to it.
I looked inside, stirred around trying to find espresso, but the cup was PURE FOAM.
I wasted almost $5 on a cup of milk foam. At this time, I was needing to hurry and get to work, so I tried to fix it and put some coffee in my cup, but all of the coffees were out except for the hazelnut. I didn't want the hazelnut, but there was no choice.
And that's it. I will never be back again. 

It pains me to say this, but I probably would have received a better drink (or at least a full one) and better customer service at Mc Donalds.Lovely location with a stellar view. Too bad the food was probably the worst we've eaten in a long time. No management in site and just young kids trying the best they could to run the place. Long waits for drinks, salads at the same time as the entree. Our fish was cold and greasy on the plate...the baked potato may have been fresh 3 days earlier. Need I say more?I went in for a tire and tube Sunday with my tire and rim in hand and they sold me a different size than I had and told me it would work.  I tried to change tire Tuesday night and I could see it was a smaller tire but I got it on rim but the tube wouldn't take any air. I went back to store and they told me they could order the right size tire but I would have to buy new tube. I thought that was bad and then he take the tire off the rim and tells me he can't give me money back for tire either. I could buy new one for his cost at $30 and that"s what I paid to begin with. So long story short. I have to pay for new tire and tube twice because they sold me the wrong tire, $80 for a flat tire. I should have listened to all the bad reviews about what arrogant dicks these guys are.
It's not like he couldn't have put the tire on a rental bike. What a bunch of Aholes. I will bad mouth these guys to every person I know til the day I die!Had bad service and bad shrimp.  Can't comeback from serving bad shrimp or should I say prawns. If it was good,3 stars at the most.Trippers, all of you other reviewers. 

This place has a bad name. Should be called "Cafe Cul-de-Sac". There is nothing cosmopolitan about this place, or their menu. Save your dollars, unless you feel the need to torture yourself.Worst experience from start to finish. Came in the day after Cinco de Mayo. Place was trashed. No one greeted us at the door. Finally someone came. Took forever to get the food (It was 5pm & only 2 other couples in the place).Food was luke warm. Waiter never came around to check. Plus I had order the Plato Caribeno. Wanted it cause it came with plantains. Received it. NO PLANTAINS. Told waiter he responded " yeah were out of those". Didn't care to mention that when ordering. Manager never came out and when we got the check they only too $0.50 off the bill. It was a $15.95 dish. Could of at least taken half off or all. Nothing like my parents remembered it to be. Ian's Pizza here I come.I really hate to give a one star review, but I think food poisoning qualifies in this case.

The waitress was great.  The crusty bread was great.  The honey butter was great.  The view was great.  The decor was great.

The crab cakes were awful.  They were swimming in a brown sauce and were packed loosely - the breadcrumb to crab ratio was not right.  The crab tasted tinny, as if it came from a can - and that might explain why the crab cakes were so wet.  So not good.

For entrees, my husband ordered a pasta diablo with shrimp.  The shrimp were a little bit tough but overall he really enjoyed his meal.  I ordered the chef's special of the day: a crab hash with an over easy egg (potatoes and peas) thinking I could fill my crab craving since the crab cakes didn't cut it.  The hash was awful.  The potatoes were burnt and the egg was overcooked.  I managed a few bites of it and then I was done.  You know you're in for it if the chef can't manage an over easy egg.

I got sick almost immediately upon leaving the restaurant.  It took my husband a little longer but we were out of commission for at least twenty four hours.  The only thing we shared were the crab cakes.

Did I mention that two entrees and one appetizer (and one beer and one glass of wine) cost us more than $100?  Don't get me wrong... if the food had been spectacular, it would have been worth every penny.  I will not go back.I take back the friendly comment.  Tom wrote me a horribly condescending email about not reading over his contradictory sublease agreement enough to understand why they would deduct charges from damages that were made before I even moved in.  Their failure to provide me with a check-in sheet (against the law) and contradictory and condescending manner in redressing my grievance is completely unacceptable.I hate everything about this blemish on State Street. Famed for nothing other than its convenient location, this bar attracts all kinds of frat boys from all walks of frat life, young and old, sleazy and more sleazy, to this unacceptable shithole of a bar/restaurant. Simply put, there are a million better places to watch "the game" than Brats.

I have never gotten food here that didn't taste like it was sitting in a freezer for upwards of a year before it was finally thawed out, microwaved thoroughly, and slapped into my plastic basket. I once ordered a quesadilla that literally cracked and fell apart in my hands, and apparently the kitchen had mixed up their raw chicken with a rubber one. The burgers taste like they were scraped off of the bottom of a boat.

And that's on a slow night. Come here for a drink or a game and be prepared for an experience that will make you want to shower for hours afterward. The last time I was here, I had a fat drunk trucker who smelled like a trash compactor hovering around my girlfriend's friend, then my girlfriend, then when he realized neither of them were interested, me. And the thing about Brats is that literally half of the people here on a given night are the adult, alumni versions of the D-average alcoholics that make up the other half. 

The trucker that wouldn't leave me alone truly deserves to be State Street Brats' mascot. If you're the type of person that started watching Sportscenter and drinking 8 Miller Lights at least once a day at 18, and plan to continue that into your late 50's, you will always feel at home at Brats.beware the store, once you have paid , you will get no call! no communication , ordered $ 6000 in furniture! i had to make all calls and chase this order down, its been three months! no call , no explanation, have only half of my furniture, " get this they ran out of frames!!!!!! lol ! good one sweetheart! lazar is one of the top furniture manufacturers in the country and they ran out of frames!!!she thinks i'm an idiot!  no retribution for my trouble, nothing ! the moron just sits there in silence listening to me explain as a contractor if i tell a customer the window will be here in 4 to 6 weeks and it takes 9 weeks, i give a discount off the window cost and the labor! this is proper courtesy and business. not to mention i paid for this furniture in fill in advance, bottom line once you have paid your history here! 3 months i'm wating for this furniture.I can't speak for the food, I didn't try it.  My boyfriend and I planned to until the owners son insulted us.  My boyfriend was talking with him regarding Turkey, the food, culture, suggestions for what to order off the menu, etc.  It's like a switch was flipped and the son, Anan I think was his name, said my boyfriends ego was too high and he was fake.  To my surprise my boyfriend stayed calm, wondering what he'd done or said to make this guy insult him for no reason.  After stumbling on words, he denied ever saying the word "fake".  I interjected that he had, and as another service member I would never talk that way to a customer.  To this his reply was that my boyfriend influenced my thoughts, we were twisting his words and that I am trash.  He proceeded to yell at us as we walked away.

The food may or may not be good.  If you'd like to support people like this, go ahead and try it.  I sure won't.This is the worst run management company I have come across in several years of renting.  Not only were they unable to manage the radiator problems I alerted the management about all fall/winter, but they refused to offer any type of credit for the inconvenience it caused.  I actually went out and purchased a thermometer to prove that my apartment was unbearable, I was correct at 90 degrees in every room.  All of my stuff was melting (think makeup/deodorant etc...)   The response? Open the window.  Sure thing, in the middle of winter when it is 0 degrees and I am a single female on the first floor. Great solution.

In addition, it appeared to be a large inconvenience for Mick to submit the appropriate paperwork for me to sublet the apartment. I dealt with several rude and unprofessional emails constantly over the course of the time I lived here.

 Would not recommend this company to anyone.  Customer service was awful and I felt there was no alternate to work with.So horrible. Worst service and a shit hole. Dirty and slobs all over. Rudest staff I have ever seen.I had been looking forward to trying this steak house for a year; however, I won't be returning.  First, we were seated at a 2 top table near the entry of the room.  No table should be placed here, so servers and diners kept nearly running us over.  It made for many disruptions.  

The really upsetting factor was the service.  We waited for 20 minutes to receive our beverages.  We waited another 20 minutes to receive the soup course.  The same occurred with the entrees.  There were never apologies from the server.  

My husband and I ordered the filets prepared medium.  Mine was well done, and his was medium - well to well done.  Since I had learned they moved so slowly there, I just forced it down.  It was very tough.  I also had an order of steak fries.  I'm convinced they were the pre-frozen Ore-Ida kind.  They were burnt and had absolutely no seasoning, not even salt.  I have digestive issues, so they would have been hard for me to digest.  I explained this to the server and asked for a batch that wasn't quite over-cooked.  She came back 20 minutes later with an identical set and said that if they cooked them any less the would be too cold in the middle.  This reinforced my belief they were frozen.  I make steak fries at home all the time, and you can do so without making them burnt to a crisp if they are actually fresh cut.  With the price of the meal, they should use fresh-cut fries.  My husband isn't picky at all, but even he said there was no point in wasting the calories to eat them because they were bland and too hard.

When the check arrived I was shocked she had charged me for the steak fries, even after I communicated I probably wouldn't be able to eat the new batch either.  Also, I had ordered lemonade and realized that for my  2 lemonades ( I ordered a refill), I was charged $2 per lemonade.  I was never told there was not a free refill.  Also, the small glass was 90% ice each time.  My husband was also charged a $1.50 up charge for ordering french onion soup even though the menu said that all entrees come with  "choice of soup or salad & vegetable."  When he pointed this out, the server did take it off the bill for us, but confirmed they do charge an up-charge.  She didn't explain why that wasn't on the menu.

We will not be returning.  We get much better service at Flemings for the same price.  I had high expectations for this old time supper club that is locally owned, but I was sadly disappointed.  It put a damper on our Valentine's Day celebration...Frida's is over priced, under inspired "Mexican" food.  The cuisine is neither authentic or unique. (or even tasty)  While I love salsa night as much as the next girl, I really would never go here to eat again. (Not when Casa de Lara is within walking distance, and El Pastor is within driving distance.  Seriously no matter what interpretation of Mexican food you prefer you can always do better than Frida's.) 

As for those seeking employment, I urge you to avoid this place. (I've never worked here, but I've had close friends who have. Check out Shawn S.'s review for a brief illustration of what I mean.)I should have known better than to try Mexican food in madison, I live in CO and the bar is pretty high. I had steak fajitas. The steak was sliced into 6" strips and the flour tortillas were only 5", so there was always meat hanging out of the fajita and inevitably you were not able to bite through the meat so ended up with pulling a strip of steak out for each bite.
The tortillas...dry and nasty
Learn my lesson.  You are in Wisconsin, not the Southwest, avoid the Mexican food and go eat something the locals know something about.Here is how my experience with Badger went down:
Phone: Ring... ring... 
Badger Cab: Automated message, with a subsequent 5 minute wait (am I in Chicago or Madison).

Person answers the phone.

Me: Hello?
BC: Hello. 
Me: Yes, I need a cab for pick up at 123 Wherever Street.
BC: Where are you going
Me: Going to XYZ bar at 123 Anywhere Street.
BC: How many people?
Me: Just me.
BC: Okay. Click.
Me: Hello? Hello?

They didn't give me an estimate of time of when I would be picked up, they never took my number (even though they might have had caller ID). They never even acknowledged whether they were going to pick me up. Figuring by the way it all ended, I figured that maybe I wasn't worth the pick up because it was just me, and I wasn't going too incredibly far. After waiting 20 minutes, I called back, and canceled, and the guy seemed like he could have cared less. I ended up flagging a cab from a different company a few minutes later anyway.They never make it on time and make you wait for a very long time. The drivers and extremely rude and extremely unfriendly.This is a JOKE of a cab service.  I scheduled a cab 5 hrs before I wanted it to come.... Then 10 minutes before I had it scheduled I
Called to say I was ready as soon as possible... 20 mins go by, I call and they said they didn't have a cab for me, it'll be 5-10 mins. So after 50 minutes of waiting
For a SCHEDULED cab... I call again to ask where it is. They said they still didn't have a cab it'd be another 15 minutes.  And the place I needed to go was now closing in 5. 

To think a cab company can't get a pre scheduled cab within an hour is the biggest joke I've ever heard. Do NOT USE THIS CAB COMPANY.WHAT A JOKE this restaurant is.  No entree that a group of 4 ordered turned out to be authentic or even taste good.   I know Afghan food very well, cause i've grown up with it.

I was totally embarrased, and even tried to speak to the owner to give my piece of mind.  This person is a disgrace to the culture, and to himself for shortchanging you as a customer of your right to have authentic Afghan food which is very delicious.  The Afghan culture prides itself on great food, and is well known throughout the world.  

This establishment is horrible, and I even thought about picketting or opening up another restaurant to compete just to prove it's shittiness.Sigh.  This place was boring 15 years ago, and it's still boring.  Do they EVER get different inventory?  I don't even like going in there to look around anymore because of the creepy salesman watching me. Oh, and their return policy is a big turn-off too.Shitty serviceOur friend's wedding was held at the Monona Terrace last weekend.  We started off with cocktails on the rooftop.  It was a warm sunny day that just enhanced the amazing view of Lake Monona and also the direct view of the Capital.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't as amazing as the view.  The bruschetta was soggy, the cucumber topped with crab meat had no flavor, and we didn't even bother trying the chicken kabobs because they looked so disgusting.

We headed back inside for the reception.  We got to the floor we thought the wedding was on and the staff told us we had to take the escalator down one more flight.  We did and felt like we were in the basement.  The semi circular room faced the lake, but by that time it was dark so there was nothing to see besides the flood lights outside.  Because of the shape of the room nothing flowed very well.  There were also huge pillars blocking lots of views.  The meal was a filet and chicken breast with roasted potatoes.  My chicken was mushy, but the filet was ok. My husband said his filet was tough.  The potatoes weren't even that good.

The reception went until midnight, but around 11:00 the waitstaff started breaking down the room!  They moved alot of the centerpieces to one area by the door(onto a flatbed cart they earlier pulled through the crowd hanging around the very small bar area) and removed the table cloths from some of the tables.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  

The room above the one we were in may be a better choice for an event, but after I saw how the staff acted I would stay away from this place...especially if it's your wedding.CRAZY overpriced unappealing boring entrees with a pretentious atmosphere...move on...  there are way way WAAYYY better choices in town.I had heard good things about Bon Appetit being a new-ish local-foods cafe in Madison, and so had been excited to try it.  But we left the restaurant very disappointed.  

For one thing, there was almost nothing that could have possibly been local in our meals, as far as I could tell.  The majority of the dishes on the small menu featured non-seasonal fruits and vegetables, like avocado and strawberry and tomato.  On top of that, the non-local foods we did have were prepared in fairly bland ways (and such small portions!*), especially given the relatively steep prices (entrees at $19). The food was fine, but given these caveats, really not worth it. 

And although the service was passable, the fact that the waitress and chef sat and talked very loudly, in the most boring ways possible, about movie trivia through our whole meal ("have you seen that one movie with that British gal? You know the one who was married to Nathan Lane? Oh you mean the one who won that Emmy?")**, made the whole setting very uncomfortable. And because the place was so small and we were the only patrons in the restaurant, we could hear all the clattering in the kitchen and had trouble focusing on our own conversation. 

We will not be returning. 

*Annie Hall reference 
**Yes, I realize I offered some movie trivia of my ownTerrible customer service. Super unhelpful. I don't care what they sell. Plus parking is a pain.I ate here with a friend for lunch this week as part of the winter Restaurant Week, hoping to try a good mix of the menu.  We sat at the bar, which was nearly empty, so I expected to easily get in and out during my one-hour lunch....an hour and 45 minutes later, we finally desperately paid the bill.

Our appetizers were fine- clam chowder and calamari- but certainly not worth the normal $10+ price.  When we reached the entrees, though, I was astounded- my seafood enchiladas were soggy and boring, but delicious compared to the completely tasteless horseradish grouper that my friend received.  We each ate about half of our meals before giving up (I am a strong advocate of cleaning my plate usually) and then finished with what seemed like grocery-store sorbet and a cold creme brulee...thank goodness I didn't have to spend more than $15!

I've always been a fan of the variety that Food Fight Inc. offers, but between the terrible service, disgusting food, and airport restaurant-esque atmosphere, I think Food Fight is ruining its reputation by continuing to support this restaurant.Went here for breakfest during the ironman race. Not sure if they regularrly serve breakfest here or not but the breakfest during the ironman was disgusting to say the least. My sister ordered French Toast and it looked like a plate of snot. The batter was runnie and quite obviously under cooked. My dad had the ironman skillet which was so small it wouldn't even make the childrens menu in chicago. The tomato juice wasn't tomato juice but a bar mixer used to make bloody mary's. All and all a big disappointment for breakfest, maybe the dinners are better but the breakfest was just aweful.Yuck.  I tried this place after it was suggested by a local.  This place was just gross.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were cold, and the spaghetti wasn't cooked enough (the noodles were still hard).I don't mind a place that serves Americanized Chinese food, but Chin's Asia Fresh scares me. The awning is pretentious enough as is with the Chinese characters and I'll forgive the awful pun catchphrase, but I won't forgive the food.

I'm going in there and I order brocolli with chicken and I get overcooked rice with this brown sauce that tastes like someone poured 10 cups of sugar. The brocolli is either raw or just severely undercooked. Now, I understand that Americanized Chinese food has the whole ketchup and sugar thing going on, but seriously, that place had a sauce that had the consistency of and tasted like maple syrup. On top of that, the food was overpriced -- $7 for a bowl of food with portions smaller than a coke can. A severe rip off!

I really don't understand the appeal of this place, but whatever floats anyone's boat. If you're seriously digging the whole Americanized Chinese food thing, you're better off heading to Asian Kitchen or A8 instead; at least the food is properly cooked and the prices are more reasonable.I am easygoing and generally do not give negative ratings (see my rating distribution!) BUT this is an exception. 

The owner is extremely rude during my few visits to their shop. They did not greet, nor did they say anything when we pay them. He treated me as if I owed them money! Incredible that the business can sustain for so many years. 

I stopped going to this place after the unpleasant experience. If you want to shop for Korean food, go to Park St. If you're looking for general pan-Asian selection, there are many better places in town.Really disappointing. Wait for our food was interminable, even after we were seated, and food came out cold -- save for the bacon, which arrived 5 minutes after we started. The Swedish pancakes were almost inedible. Chewy and cold. Used to be one of my favorites. And, to top it off, it was really expensive AND the staff didn't seem the least bit interested when I suggested that the meal wasn't up to their standards. I won't be back.Smoky's is a traditional Wisconsin Supper Club, but it's reputation may have outlasted the actual experience. 

My dinner mate and I both ordered the most expensive steak on the menu and it was not exceptional. In fact, half of mine was so grizzled that I took it home...& fed it to my dogs the next morning. 

I wish this local establishment the very best, but it will have to step up it's game to compete with Madison's emerging restaurants. Drinks at the bar were well made and strong; average wait time 45-60 minutes on Saturday night.I had both my sons through doctors here. Neither births were positive experiences although my sons are happy and healthy. Pediatricians upstairs are grand. Obgyn, not so much.I am writing this review for my poor sister who ordered their delivery last night.  She ordered the spring rolls, summer rolls and mieng sabai.  She specifically asked no peanuts because she is still breastfeeding and her son is allergic.  After an hour wait, she received her food; ALL of it contained peanuts.  She called back the University location and was told that they would call her back. They did not. She then called the Odana location and was told that none of those dishes contained peanuts...hmm, funny because they did! The woman on the phone did not offer to remake the food or even offer an apology...tsk tsk. I understand that this is a family owned restaurant and inconsistency in service/food happens - but to simply not offer to remake her food was ridiculous because the order was wrong and she was unable to eat the food that she paid for.  

Service has always been a little iffy here, but because food continued to be yummy, we could not stop ourselves. But this time was the last straw. I hope Sa-Bai Thong can re-evaluate their customer service, or else they will continue to lose loyal customers their business is built upon.I like their bag system and their drive-through.  However, they don't give receipts!  How do I know if they lost a shirt if I don't know how many shirts I dropped off?  Strange not to do this.  

Also, their 'reward' points system is a complete joke.  If you spend $1000 you get a 50% off coupon.  Awesome.  

They also do not launder shirts very well.  The collars are always crushed and honestly sometimes my shirts smell worse (like smoke) when I get them back.  A monopoly is tough to break...A precaution about my review: I ordered through CampusSpecial.com, so there's some of the blame for my order there, as well. I also haven't actually been inside, so I can't judge the actual place, either.

What I can say: I ordered online, my order went through as BBQ boneless wings. It said so on the box as well, so I'm assuming this isn't on CampusSpecial.com for the screw-up.

What I got: plain bone wings. They were not that good, either; seriously lacking in any kind of flavor. Plain wings don't need to be devoid of flavor to be "plain," they can taste like some spice. It was $8 so not the worst, but I know I can get much better, especially at the price.

I've ordered here in the past, and though the screw-up here convinced me that they're not getting another dime out of me, I wasn't entirely thrilled with the pizza I had from them or the dessert pizza either.

Maybe if I had gotten what I'd asked for, I'd be a little more generous. But I didn't. The service disappoints as does the food. Maybe if I was drunk ...It would have been nice to see if they actually HAVE good pizza. I went into their dining room and waited to be seated. Two waitresses and only one table occupied.  Despite being only five feet from them, neither bothered to acknowledge me or ask if I wanted to sit down. They were too busy talking and deciding which CD to play. After waiting for a time, I walked out.  I couldn't believe how rude they were.Awful. Percy's on Monroe St. had our van for over a year and a half - that's right, 1-1/2 YEARS!! Lied about working on it. Lied about getting parts. Had it sitting outside in snow and rain to rust away. Finally, my husband figured out what it was and he ordered the parts after they said it was difficult to find fuel injectors. My husband found them with no difficulty. Would not recommend this place. Sure seemed like they were up to something nefarious or just completely incompetent.I've been out in California for the last three years, but I lived in Madison back when Bluephies first opened in 1994, and have sampled it pretty regularly over the various chef/menu changes.  The last time I came here for dinner, it was a pleasure. I associated Bluephies with fresh local greens, unique flavors that favored aioli and tapenade over mayo, and especially over-the-top breakfast yumminess.

 Alas, whatever's happened to dinner in the last year and a half, is totally depressing.  My fiance, my mother, and my two stepkids and I went the last night (8/11) we were in Madison before flying back here.  I ordered an apple chicken walnut salad sandwich, which used to be a pretty awesome blend of aioli and a locally baked croissant with mixed greens, with an interesting presentation.

What I got, was something substandard to the airport food that we had at Denver International Airport, and more expensive to boot.  The chicken salad was totally overwhelmed with mayo, the lettuce flabby, and the croissant one of those commercial flabby affairs.  The kids menu dinner items were horrifying; the cheese quesadilla and pizza were microwaved and pretty darn tiny.  My mother's the most forgiving person when it comes to restaurants, but her salmon wasn't good either.  My fiance's meal was totally over-mayoed as well. 

The waitress staff were good, and one waitress who had been there for 2 1/2 years said that it wasn't what it used to be.  And when we complained about the quality of the food, they took off one plate from the price.  I know times are tough, but even out here people have the sense that if you want people to try to get you to ever come back, you should comp the whole meal, or at least offer a free dinner the next time around.

I've used Yelp a bunch of times to check out restaurants ahead of time, but this meal inspired me to actually start up my own account.This place really disappointed me. I've been here several times in the past, but I shan't be returning. 

We ordered some appetizers, two in fact. Soup and some mac'n'cheese and bacon bite things (don't judge.) Only the soups arrived. The server was pretty good, and she apologized up and down, and offered free dessert. Hey, if I was going to have mac'n'cheese and bacon bites, who am I to turn down free dessert? 

But before we even got to the dessert, we had to have the entree, which was nothing short of a big flop. I'll admit, I was scared the quiche I ordered was going to be a sliver of a thing, but this was a honking piece of egg pie. It wasn't particularly warm, however. And the salad that was served with it was terrible. Like it was bathed in the Gulf Coast (olive) oil slick. 

My dining companion's entree fared even worse. The chicken whateveritwas was flavorless and was covered in a thick film of olive oil; the result of being plated with another one of Bluphie's "tossed greens" piles. And the mashed potatoes were, by all accounts, terrible. My dining companion is a mashed potato connoisseur, thus I am unable to account for their terribleness. In his words, "this experience should be a testament to my love of mashed potatoes. They were so bad, but I ate all of them anyway." He said they were really crusty, like they'd been sitting in a chafing dish for hours. I'm no chef, but if there's one thing life experience has taught me, when mashed potatoes form a top crust, stir it up, and voila! Good as new. That couldn't even be bothered to have happened. 

So we decided to split the offered complementary dessert, as neither of us was feeling too adventurous, in light of what we just experienced. We settled on carrot cake, which, in its defense, was massive. But that's where the defense ends. To be sure, the cake was fine. It wasn't dry. It featured a cream cheese(?) frosting. But it was topped with chopped walnuts that came from some form of freezer or refrigerator. My money is on a freezer. Have you ever stored walnuts in a freezer? Have you ever forgotten them so they freezer burned AND absorbed whatever flavors were mingling in the ecosystem of your freezer? Yes? Then you know the rancid taste of these nuts. It was beyond gross. We didn't finish the cake. 

The decor of the joint is loud, and it's cavernous, and has lots of seating. The restaurant wasn't full by any accounts, but did seem to be "bustling". I simply don't understand why. It just wasn't good. As I mention above, I've eaten here in the past, and enjoyed it. It seems as though something has gone awry. Perhaps its decline in quality is directly related to the crappyness of the mini-corporation that is FoodFight (I am, in full disclosure, not a fan of their other establishments, by and large.) I blame them.After reading the positive reviews listed here we called Monroe Street Framing looking for assistance in mounting a .  Initially I spoke with Jeremy who lived up to everything that the reviews indicated the staff with Monroe Street Framing would be.  He was knowledgeable, pleasant and extremely helpful.  Our experience with Jeremy was everything that we would have expected from the reviews.  Jeremy helped us to come up with a solution to wall mount a small hand-made quilt.  

The agreement was that we would pay for and pick up the foam core two weeks later (we were leaving for a trip).  Upon returning from our trip I again called the shop and spoke with a woman who was unable to find our order and insisted that they did not take the order and would not have been able to fill such an order.  I called again and spoke with the owner Dave.  I explained what had happened and initially he was pleasant and again helpful.  He confirmed that they would in fact be able to provide a piece of foam core in the size that we had requested.  When he realized that all we had ordered was the foam core his attitude became extremely negative and hostile and his willingness to work with us was non-existent.  He explained that they were a "full service" framing shop and that there was no financial benefit for them to sell us the foam core and he was unwilling to do so. 

I tried to explain that we had been told that this was an option per Jeremy.  Dave responded, "I don't know what he told you, but I am the boss and I am not going to do this...try finding it on on-line if you can.  Good luck."   We were very disappointed with his response and attitude.

While we may have only been looking for a piece of foam core this time, "owner" Dave seems to have missed the point of customer service and the benefit of a return customer.  We will never consider going back to Monroe Street Framing for any other project, nor will we recommend the shop to friends and family.  It seems clear from the treatment that we received from Dave that they do not feel the need to encourage new business.  Apparently our business was beneath them.  We wish them luck.

Within 15 minutes of talking to Dave I called a local sign company, Budget Signs, who agreed to sell us a piece of foam core immediately.  No waiting, no hassle and no dismissive, negative attitude.  Thank you Budget Signs!The restaurant smells like an assisted living facility. There is a huge dining room and only 3 tables are occupied at any given time, which shouldn't come as a surprise I guess. Service is slow. The menu seems overpriced, especially given the other  dining choices nearby.If you are 60+ and have $5, this is the place for you. The food is greasy, the decor is stuck in the 70's, the waitress was a bitch. Just horrible all around.I got into Madison pretty late due to a delayed flight.  It was getting pretty late and I just wanted something to eat after checking into  my hotel room.  They had an ad in the hotel directory so I ordered from them for delivery.  I know, I know, I should have checked Yelp first.
1) They were "out" of thin crust.  Umm, yeah weird but ok.   I'm tired and hungry so I'll go for their usual "pan style"
2) They took over an hour to deliver from 3 blocks away
3) The pizza was truly gross.  I should have just gotten something from a gas station or something.  It was not good pizza.I do not get why people go to Rocky's. The pizza is absolutely horrendous. The sauce tastes like sugar and the crust is soggy. You are better off purchasing a frozen pizza.Boring, bland and over priced for what it is. Originally we liked it but prices went up and food quality slightly down makes it not worth going.Horrible horrible food. This is not Mexican food in any shape form or fashion. Even the rice isn't authentic. The tamale was edible, but not fantastic. The burrito I got was disgusting, bland, and slapped together. The enchilada my husband ordered was basically the same as my burrito but with a corn tortilla instead of flour. And the taco was more disgusting than taco bell. 

I can't believe this passes for Mexican food and I can't believe this has four stars.

We will never ever go here again. 

The salsa and chips were decent and the service was quick (although not good service; he didn't say a SINGLE thing or offer to do anything about it when I told him that my burrito was gross).I would not recommend this vet clinic. We had used this clinic for years but over the last 4 years the service has gone down hill. The staff and Dr Hook are unprofessional and rude. If we ever called to ask about something that concerned us they would blow us of or make us feel stupid for calling. When we took the pet in they talked down to us and didn't answer the question asked, They showed no compassion for our pet and made us (loyal customers) feel like a number.They charge too much, care is so-so.  I would go to Veterinary Emergency Service.  I wish I could do it all over again.  They will also suggest you take the route that is "most expensive," and prey on your feelings towards our pet.  Stay away.Not my favorite place to be. Sometimes I go here to please others or when choices are grave. I suppose free bacon is cool. Yet, a staged line to perpetuate the space is more crowded than usual on a bleak, frigid Wisconsin night is severely uncool. 

The staff here is actually awesome. Too bad they have to deal with the scum of the earth as patrons. Out-of-town and in-town douche bags litter the three floors. The third floor on a Saturday night is something out of my worst nightmares.I am confused.  I have been here twice and had donuts worse than Copps.  OK, I will try a few more options.  1. Go at 1AM.  2. Go at 4PM.  I don't know whats wrong with me but this place seems overrated.If the car wash business is now charging more for doing less and charging extra for things that used to be included like vacuuming and interior cleaning, then it doesn't surprise me that Octopus is still in business.  I won't go into my story but I want to say in clear terms: I paid $25, had to deflect a hard sell of the new "detailing" services for another $25 and still my car came out barely vacuumed, interior surfaces still dusty and no scent.  This has been my experience several times. I should not have to verbally ask for my car to be cleaned, it should be so.  I will stick to the $7 drive-thru and bite the bullet to do the detailing myself.  Don't continue to encourage this despicable business tactic of giving you less for more.  Don't go here!Mediocre Asian food made to accommodate american taste.  Ok tasting but not authentic.  Do not like the ambience but it is conveniently located very close/on UW-Madison campus.Unfortunately I have to agree with Felix and Ashlee. We stopped here for lunch while visiting Madison.  The food was not very good. I had shrimp with peapods and the shrimp was not flavored at all, it was like they had taken precooked boiled shrimp and put it on the dish after it was finished. We also got a chicken dish and the chicken was not good at all. It was so poor that we couldn't even eat it. Wonton soup often has meat wrapped up in the wontons at this place the wonton soup was just wontons.  Seeing reviews that this is the best or second-best Chinese food in Madison does not speak well for the Madison food scene. I would not come back to this restaurant again.   The location is good, the service was good, but the food was not good at all.To be fair, I only went here once a few months ago. It was a Wednesday and not a busy night.  It's near where I live so I was hoping it would be good.  I will have to try it again, but it's difficult to try a place again and possibly have another bad experience when we have so many good places so I will likely wait until soemone I know recommends it.
Service was poor.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted while staff chatted at bar and kept going to karaoke area.  Was not asked about refill when water and beer were out.  Food (noodle bowl with veggies) was greasy (not in a good way), salty (not in a good way) and bland otherwise. Area behind the bar was less than clean. 
I walk by often and do not see many customers, even college kids, so I suspect they still need to get their act together.  Hope they do.  Great location.Service: B
Food: F

Went to Biaggi's for the first time on a friends recommendation. It's possible I ordered the wrong things but our appetizer and food was awful. They even managed to mess up soda - it was very watered down. I'm never going there again.

Stay away from Fried Ravioli and Penne Sardi, if you're forced to go there.This was the worst pedi I have ever had and I get monthly pedi's.  The only reason I went here and not my usual place was because my friends boss said this place was great.   The pedi took about 30 minutes total.  About 2 minute soak, no massage, the massage chairs are crappy and the guy actually cut my toe with something.  They didn't even put the thing to separate your toes on!!!  My polish job looks good, I asked for a design on my big toe and it looks aweful.  I do not recommend this place.  Plus, they had their screaming children running around...that was very relaxing.  Do not go here.My dining partners really wanted Olive Garden; as much as I protested, I lost out and begrudgingly went along for lunch.

Slowest service ever. An hour plus wait for our salads and soup. No drink refills. Food was cafeteria grade (sorry to insult cafeterias) at best.

Old and dated interior; chairs are stained and disgusting. Ick, ick, ick.

And, it's expensive and the service is attrocious. We left a miniscule tip, and in hindsight should've asked for our money back. There's not a nice way to put it; Olive Garden sucks. Why do people tolerate such a horrible place?!I hadn't been to Olive Garden in years and was very excited to take my kids this past weekend as a treat for their great report cards.

What a disappointment!

I will start with the positive - we were seated within 5 min, despite the busy time for them. Our server was very kind.

Now, the not-so-positive....
We were given a menu with a menu within. I wondered why 2, as it seemed the smaller menu had similar items, except for they were priced in half. Then I realized the smaller menu was their lunch menu and since it was 12:30 pm, I set the bigger (dinner) menu aside.

It seemed like it took a really long time for our food to arrive, but again, they were pretty busy so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The problem is that it is hard not to fill up on salad and bread sticks. I found Iceberg lettuce to be a rather cheap choice.

My meal was ok but nothing impressive. Such was the opinion of the other 3 people at the table. 

One of my daughters ordered chicken Alfredo (or so I thought) but got Alfredo noodles with no chicken. I thought perhaps she did not speak clearly enough when she ordered and since she had already filled up on breadsticks and salad, I decided to not say anything.

The really sad part began after we got the bill.
I usually don't pay attention to the details on my restaurant bills and I don't know what prompted me to do it this time. First thing I noticed was a charge of $2.50 for chicken with the kid's Alfredo noodles. I told our server that the meal actually did not have chicken.
After apologizing, he said he will have his manager remove the extra charge as well as remove the 2 sundae charges for us as a courtesy. I thought that was very nice of him. 

A few minutes later, he came back embarrassed, to say that his manager removed the chicken charge but not the desserts. I did not find this to be a problem since my kids consumed the desserts anyway. 

After he brought the credit card slip to sign, I took a closer look at the bill and realized both adult meals were at twice the listed price. Then I remembered the 2 menus. 

On our way out, I asked the hostess what the difference between the two menus was and after she told me the smaller menu was for lunch, I asked what was needed to order lunch items next time. She replied: "We serve lunch until 4pm".
Then I looked at the clock (close to 2 pm) and asked why we were charged dinner prices. Her reply was: "let me get my manager". 
More than 5 min later, when no one came, I asked her if I should continue to wait. She said: "let me check" and ran back inside. After a few more minutes the manager came.
I shook his hand and introduced myself. His reply was: "Hi, how can I help you"?
I had to ask him for his name. After he introduced himself, I shared with him my confusion about their "lunch and dinner menus/prices" and that since we had come in at noon, we thought we were getting the lunch option but were charged for dinner".
He replied that on weekends, they "expect people to eat more"(?!?!?!), therefore, hand out dinner menus (not true!). He also stated that lunch can be ordered at any time of the day, "even at 10 pm" (which contradicted the waitress), but you had to specifically tell yours server you wanted the lunch item. Then, before I even had the chance to respond, he said: "Hold on, I'll be back". He ran in the back and after some time came back and handed me a gift card, saying: "Sorry about the confusion, this should help with your next visit".

I thanked him and walked out where my boyfriend and kids who were getting pretty impatient, as they had been waiting for more than 10 min. 
Once we got in the car and I looked at the gift card, I just about screamed - a $5 gift card.  I found that to be extremely insulting and pathetic and promised NEVER to go back there again!

There are plenty of local businesses striving for service that is truly oriented towards serving quality real food and customer satisfaction.I had a very bad experience with them,. I ordered LoMein noodles and asked them to make it spicy. When I went to pick the food, I was charged $12, It sounded pretty expensive. I was hesitant to ask what was the normal price. I though I can check that in their menu and also I wanted one menu for my future ordering. I could not find any to-go menu on their counter. I could find few on the other side out of my reach. I requested her if I can have a menu. She rudely said that they don't have as much and can't give one to me. I told her, I will review and return it back t her. She rudely refused and said she can't give it me. I have never experienced anything like this. It was really frustrating. I felt very much discriminating. I am not a citizen of this country and have different country origin which is visibility seen. I assume, if it was someone else, she could have definitely given the  menu. Very upsetting. I ended paying $12+ for one order of noodle. Please be aware to check the price of your order over the phone before heading there. Otherwise you will surprised and end up paying more. This place does not know what customer service is.Very disappointed and couldn't sleep. This is the place to stay if you want to hear a loud party outside your room. There is a bar very close that plays live music thurs-sat until 2am. it practically makes the building shake. I complained and there wasnt anything they could do. I at least wanted ear plugs!!!! I would book a hotel further from that bar in the area; avoid this one!!!! Plus there was hair in the shower when we got here... Gross!!!!Horrible Auto Service!!!! Second time I have been on hold with the department for over 15min.... I had to call from another phone to make sure someone was getting to me and no one was, finally talked to someone and have been on hold another 25min. for a manager... not even one star ratingSorry kids....I stopped by this store with their NOW OPEN sign inviting me in...only to be stuck in some ante-room with an intercom. I rang the bell and then came the interrogation. "What do you want? What are you looking for? Do you have an appointment? " By the time I was permitted to come in, I was followed around the store like a burglar and felt very uncomfortable. The whole interroagation was off-putting. I've been to finer jewlery stroes all over the world, and not had to work that hard to get through the door. The location is not upscale...but they way they acted, they were located on Michigan Ave. I would never return.A few of us ordered a delivery to work. When i opened my steamy lunch combo, it was super greasy with a  hair to boot. ( which i discovered only after my first two nibbles) nice. i have never ordered from them since. yikes.This was the Chinese restaurant that convinced me to start being more fussy about where I buy my Chinese food.  Though they have had some good food at times they used to have some gawd awful cobwebs hanging off their decorations at the front desk.  I don't know how they missed this but if they miss this they also miss other details.  Never went back .  I hope they cleaned their decorations.  If you go there check it out.  If not, well there you go, I rest my case.I hate the biggest toy store there is.
Gee wiz.
They do have good prices but it's the worst shopping experience and they sell sooo much CRAP. 
The staff I dealt with there (checkout person) however was very pleasant.
The only reason I have for posting this review is to encourage people to shop the small businesses on etsy and in your local area. It's worth the extra bit of money.
Buy less and buy better quality!UPDATE:  The car sold after being listed for two days.  It was bought by a mechanic that spent an hour looking over the car.  He payed my full asking price because he said he couldn't find anything that needed repair.I hesitated to write this review, but after the past 3 weeks of run-around, all due to Best Buy, I had to share my tale and caution others to go elsewhere to upgrade their cell phone.  

I've purchased many, many things from Best Buy; I'm going to focus on my experience with their cellular/mobile electronics section.

My iPhone 4 was in need of an upgrade; Best Buy had the iPhone 5 on sale for $50 less than anyone else.  As fate would have it, they even had a few in stock, so I zipped over to Best Buy on 12/26 to upgrade my phone.

I made it abundantly clear to the gentleman who "helped" me that I didn't want to change anything on my service.  All that I wanted was to upgrade the phone, renew my contract with AT&T (ugh, ick, horrible - like dealing with the devil), and keep everything exactly the same as it was.

He was extremely casual about the event - too casual, in fact, as he spent the majority of his time texting someone from his own phone.  He went about setting up the new phone, clicked away with his mouse, and at every opportunity was using his own phone to text someone.

He proclaimed the new phone was set-up, and that I'd get a "welcome" e-mail from AT&T.  I asked if I could confirm that my account was left "as is" - he said that he didn't have any way to provide it to me, other than by e-mail.  I asked directly if my call plan, data plan, text plan, and discount were still in-tact, and he said, "Yeah, man - don't worry, it's all there."

I left with my new iPhone 5, and went about my business.

5 days later, I received a text notice from AT&T stating that I had exceeded more than $100 in texting fees.  "Impossible!" I proclaimed, "I have unlimited texting!"

Then it dawned on me that I never received the e-mail as promised from the distracted gentleman who assisted me at BB.

I drove over to the AT&T store on the West Side and inquired about my plan.  The person who assisted me there indicated that Best Buy had not carried over my unlimited texting plan.  He also indicated that Best Buy had dropped my voice plan to a lower level plan.  The AT&T store corrected these items and I went on my way.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I realized that I wasn't receiving any visual voicemail services.  iPhone users know what I'm talking about - the little push notifications that show as "badges" when you have an unheard voicemail.

I went back to the AT&T store and asked them to check on the issue.  Once again, Best Buy was the culprit - they had dropped visual voicemail service from my plan at the time of the upgrade.  They clearly showed me on the screen that the changes had taken place on 12/26 - the same day that I upgraded my phone with Best Buy.

The final straw came when I received my bill, and noticed that my affiliation discount was missing.  I called AT&T, and guess what?  The discount was dropped on 12/26.

So... if you need to upgrade your phone, I'd urge you to do it elsewhere.  In talking with the AT&T store staff, they all shared horror stories from Best Buy customers.  One person at the west side store said, "We spend a disproportionate amount of our time fixing problems initiated by Best Buy."

Best Buy = 0 stars - FAILToday I went to Lenscrafters to get a new contact prescription and a new pair of glasses. I had an appointment set for 11am and was first helped around 11:05 to get the initial screening before the actual eye exam. By 11:30 I was just waiting for the doctor to get back from "running to the post office". I was told I should start looking at frames while waiting, so I did and was quickly approached by a worker offering to answer any questions etc.  At this point I felt great about the service and was happy with my overall experience. Finally the doctor was back and took me in at 11:40 for the eye exam including the pupil dilation. While the dilation was setting in I was told to continue looking at frames again until the doctor could see me again. Ten minutes later I figured I should go check in with the doctor to finish up the exam. By this time I had pretty much found the frames I wanted and thought I would be out of there soon (it had already been almost an hour and a half since I arrived). 

Finally the eye exam was over and I came back out to find the woman who had been helping me with the glasses to finish and pay for them. Come to find out, there were 2 other customers that she was helping which meant I had to continue to wait just to pay for the frames. It was now 12:40 and I was assuming I would have been able to finish getting frames, seeing as I had actually made an appointment for contacts and glasses when these other customers had just walked in. As I waited for another 20 minutes, one of the two woman working the desk decided to take customers that had just walked in even though I had been there since 11am. The customer sitting next to me even said something to the worker, asking why these new people were being seen when I had been there so long. She said she would "take care of it" but did nothing to help me. Finally at 1:15 I gave up. I could not wait any longer and gave the woman the glasses I would have bought, and told her I could not wait for her. Had they not been so terrible with customer service, maybe I would have waited a little longer. There was such terrible communication between the employees and the customers--- no one knew when they would be helped or if they ever would. Maybe they should have a sign in sheet with the time of arrival so that you knew how long of a wait it might be. 

 I will now NEVER go back to lenscrafters, and I suggest you also find I different place to get an eye exam or get new glasses. It will not be worth the wait.I'm going to mimic the sentiments given by another Dan S. reviewer in 2012.  I couldn't have said it better and agree 100%.  The account he gave about his experience is EXACTLY the same as the one I just had.  Sorry, Brooke, but your 5 stars is way overrated.  I've been to a lot nicer facilities than this (Anyone been to Lifetime Fitness in the Twin Cities?).  The only thing going for it is that, yes, it's a big building. 

The only reason I had gone here was because a co-worker of mine gave me 2 of his Guest Passes.  Silly me for not reading the fine print.  The second time I went (1 week later), they made me pay $20 due to their 'policy' of using Guest Passes once in a calendar year.   What??????  I just don't get how you can attract potential customers/clients with such a rediculous rule.  That's HALF of what a monthly membership is. I've worked for a few health clubs over the years and guest passes were never as strict as the one at Princeton Club. I also went online after (to write them a scathing email) and found out that they have an offer to get a 7-day pass, but of course the manager NEVER even offered that up to me when I was shelling out my $20.  (Note:  You can only use the 7-day pass during certain hours during the day, mainly when sales staff are present).  
Not to mention I had to wait 15 minutes for the manager to even come to the front desk. Literally, I was just standing there, while the girls behind the desk were saying hello to all of the members coming in.   The manager, who eventually graced me with his presence was Matt and it looked like he just graduated high school.  No hello.  No apologies for waiting.  Nothing.  

Well, sorry, Matt.  You have a nice looking gym with a lot of glass, but I don't want any part of it.I've dropped a lot of coin at Steve's.  And I mean - A LOT.  I've bought a ton of extremely high-end whiskey, bourbon, scotch, and tequila, along with enough microbrewery beer to compete with a bustling tavern.

Recent purchases have included: Pappy Van Winkle 23, Midleton Very Rare, Glenmorangie, Oban 18, Buffalo Trace, and 1942 - just to give you an idea... I've purchased from Steve's 4 times in the past 8 days.  

The service has never been "warm and fuzzy" - despite knowing a fair amount about various liquors and wines, I'm no expert; the staff at Steve's is semi-helpful, and semi-rude.  I'd expect a gruff interaction if I were buying swill from a campus liquor store, but not from a place like Steve's on the corner of Junction and Mineral Point.

Despite the less than consistent (and less than friendly) service, I liked Steve's, and I would've rated them at a solid 4-stars.  Until last night.

A small group of three adults (each of us 40+) were in the area at about 8:45pm and decided to grab 2 bottles of wine and some soda.  We raced over to Steve's and were relieved to find it was still open.  As we approached the door, an employee sternly told us, "You literally have LESS than 1 minute to buy your sh&t and get the f*ck out of here."

We said, "Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir?"  He didn't answer.  So, two of us dashed for the wine; I made a b-line to the soda area.  

There were 6 customers in the store; each was in line with their items. We were first up in line - the two bottles of wine were rung-up by the same "dude" who "greeted" us at the door with obscenities.  

I approached with my soda, and the same employee turned to his co-worker and said, "F&ck this - we're done.  We're not doing this sh&t now.  Don't sell a f*cking thing to any of these people.  I'm not f*cking doing this - not tonight.  Everyone out!  EVERYONE OUT - NOW."

I looked at him, with my soda in hand and said, "Not even a soda?"  And he said, "Get the f^ck out of here!"

Wow.  I wish I was embellishing or exaggerating.  

I was shocked, as were the other folks; we set our things down and filed out.  The guy then slam/pulled the door shut as we left.

I vow that I will NEVER buy another item from Steve's ever again.  I'm glad to know that this location is being closed/annexed soon, and I can only hope that the colossal douche bag who was working there that evening lands his next job scrubbing porta-potties at the county chili festival.

I fully realize that we were there dangerously close to 9:00pm; that's our bad, and it's totally on us.  But why even let us in?  Why not say, "Hey, sorry folks - we're at 9:00pm - you'll have to see us another day."

Instead, he let us in, swore at us, and then made a scene in front of everyone in the store (the other customers were older folks as well - a grey-haired gentleman with a 12-pack of Miller Lite, and a couple that had a bottle of what appeared to be wine).  That's unprofessional in any arena.

So, adios, Steve's.  I wish I could return the stuff I bought from you earlier this week.  I'd expect crappy service from the drones at Woodman's liquor store, but never from Steve's.  Believe me when I say that I'm done, and that I'm still shocked, some 20 hours later...Yes, the coffee is decent, but the service has been repetitively so abominable, that I now forgo the joe in the morning at the Odana shop, even if I'm dying for a good cup, I just can't deal with the service.

One easy example, a guy who works there once was on the phone when I gave my order, a personal call. He took my order, rang it up incorrectly since he wasn't paying attention, twice. The order was for a hot chocolate and a decaf - which has to brew independently.  After! the call ended and he rang me up, he THEN! started the hot chocolate. Then, after the hot chocolate was finished! he started the decaf. This was about 7 minutes into the beginning of my order. Then, with hot chocolate in hand, I waited over 5 for the decaf to brew. The whole time too he was chatting with someone about politics and I"m not sure exactly how long the decaf really took.

This is how it should have gone: No phone call, DUH, the second he heard "decaf" he should have set it up to brew, then returned to ring me up. Then finish with the hot chocolate, so it would still be hot while the decaf finished, hand me two drinks in a reasonable 4 minutes, not 12. Horrible.Just ate here for the last time. Have gone here probably 20 times total in the past 4 years. Big fan of the sushi happy hour. However quality control is non existent. Found a hair in my salad, two out of my three sushi rolls were not made right and the crab in one tasted rotten. Totally disappointed. Check out VIP sushi next door. Much better and where I'll be taking my business from now on.Cripes, do I even have to give one star? Pedro's is about as Mexican as I am. Bland food and flavorless sauces abound. I feel you could order anything on the menu and wind up tasting the same food. Everything was just bland and limp. This is the worst kind of faux-Mexican food the world has to offer. 

TL;DR: Bleh.For 17.50, the machine washed the outside off car. Interior wasn't touched. The manager let me know that wiping down the interior is t included. Positive my 11 year old will do a better job for less.Some great food, some very old shelf food and some miserable people behind the counter.
I can't recall a place that had more unfriendly people waiting on you.  They apparently hate working here.  I can't blame them.  They are cramped up inside this small space that looks like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound.
I once accidentally asked for a certain number year cheddar and they about pulled a gun out from under the counter and shot me.  "WHAT?!  THERE IS NO SUCH THING!"  My mistake, I mean 7 year cheddar.  I  had accidentally used the price in place of the year.
Never a thank you, never a friendly chit chat at check out.  Here ya go.  Ugghh.  I really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are good.

Apparently I wrote this when the place was closed for repairs.   Didn't mean to add insult to injury.   But my comments were on the staff not so much the food.   I am hopeful that all of the old shelf food went up in flames.   If I return I won't worry about what I buy from the shelf.   What I said about the staff is true.   I have never seen a smile in this place.
.Weirdly there is no yelp for the Verona one. So I am putting it here.  But I wish I had read these. 

I didn't realize until I read other reviews that they include a shampoo with your hair cut. My hair cut last about 10 minutes.  I have hair that is the same length, all I wanted was it cut so that I could still put it up to sleep. I specially mentioned this to her twice.  I wish I could include a picture of how short it actually is. Good luck hearing from someone if you want to talk to someone about not liking your cut.  

My advice pay a few dollars more and find a place that will take responsibility when they screw up.This store has a very unclean produce department. The zucchini, yellow squash, loose potatoes and egg plant are displayed in black trays that are literally dripping with brown slime. There was a rotten and moldy zucchini right on top of the rest of the squash. I asked to speak with the produce manager but he was gone already so I showed the female employee, working on a display of bananas, the trays. She simply said, "Yea, I see it," and walked away. She didn't remove the rotten zucchini or make an attempt to say that the trays were indeed gross and needed to be steam cleaned. It was so gross that I left before even buying the tea that I had in my hand. It was totally disgusting thinking of the bacteria that the vegetables were laying in. Needless to say I certainly will not be shopping at Safeway. If I could it would be NO stars for this store.I've already posted this review for the location at Bell and 7th Ave, but thought I needed to post it again since we took our dog here, too.

This "pet hospital" is a scam and a total waste of money. Their vets seem like they barely passed vet school. We took our wonderful dog, Duke, into them when he developed a lump on his side. After taking x-rays, blood tests, etc., the vet told us that the lump was "a medical mystery". Prior to this, we had signed up for their pet wellness plan. In short, we took our dog to a reliable, trustworthy vet (Dr. Ryan at Blue Cross Vet Clinic) and it turned out he had bone cancer :-(. He ended up passing away this summer, yet my husband and I are still being forced to pay for our Banfield pet wellness plan each month, even though our dog is dead. Thanks, Banfield.We have two dogs and joined the Banfield plan, with the full intention of getting fantastic service while saving money. (Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan. We pay $25 per dog monthly). We have been incredibly disappointed, and here's why:
- Our office visits are never free, the doctors always find a way to charge you for something. One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!? 
- I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you.
- With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my "discounted ones"
- Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our "discounted savings" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online.
- They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract.
- I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash. 

Overall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam. Support local businesses, save money and take your pets to a local pet hospital. Our contract is up next June thank goodness - that cannot come soon enough!!I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  

My brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  

We made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation.I have never flown US Airways since they became US Airways.  I did however, fly America West and was happy with them nearly every time I flew with them.

I HAVE to write this review, as I had an awful experience with them yesterday.  I was scheduled at 7:23am out of Phoenix and arriving back here in SF at 9:30 am in enough time for work at 11am.  I arrive, and proceed to the E check-in.   The computer starts having "issues" and so I try to get the attendants attention and I failed.  Knowing I didn't have a lot of time before we depart, I decided to to to the counter check-in.   I waited 5 minutes before getting to the counter only to be told that I was no longer on this flight b/c it was less than 30 minutes before departure!  WHAT???  I have a carry on ANNNNND that computer right there (pointing at it) has something wrong with it and that is why I came through your line.  It was 25 minutes to departure and she refused to check me in!!  Again, I ONLY had a carry on.  It didn't matter to her that I had to be at work at 11am.  Arriving in SF later than 9:30 am was NOT AN OPTION for me.  She hastily said, "you can try and get through security and see if maybe they'll let you on the flight.  That is all I will do for you!"

I finally get through security and get to the gate at EXACTLY 7:22am, one minute to spare, begging the customer services reps to let me on the flight or I was going to lose my job.  

They of course told me NO.  The flight was delayed 2 hours and I was late anyway!!!  Ahhhhh...

Thankfully, the flight attendant had a lot of personality and was very accommodating to me, even if I was 1.5 hours late for work.  

I wish I had the name of that lady in the Phoenix airport downstairs at the check in desk.  I mean, when I pointed to the computer that was giving me problems, there was a tech guy working on it and she saw him.  Even seeing him, she still wouldn't accommodate me in any way and was rude about it.  Poor customer service!  I WON'T be flying this airline again, I can tell you that. 

I was not only blown away by their complete lack of care for me and the "issues" I was having with their E-check-in computer, but also the lack of  "social" skills one needs when working in customer service.  Eye contact!!OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.I have never had more problems with an airline like this one.  I booked a flight from Sacramento to DFW with a connecting flight in Phoenix, AZ.  THe flight was delayed so much that I missed my connecting flight in Phoenix.  The airline had delayed the Phoenix flight to DFW 15 minutes and they still had 20+ people miss their flight.  They are very unorganized and I will NEVER fly them again.  The agent ended up giving him highlighted piece of paper to call for a hotel since he missed the last flight of the day.  It was only for $30 off. He still had to pay $70 when you include tax for something he couldn't help!  I had a previous situation that happened similar to this one where my had to stay the night in a hotel.  Luckily, on that trip they did pay for the hotel, however, I was given meal vouchers (without a car) to a McDonald's on the other side of a busy interstate about 1 mile way.  I have never had any problems with any other airlines.  I have never even written a review before, but this was makes for a good first.  I had forgotten about my previous incident being that it happen a few weeks ago.  I don't think there is anything that could change my view about this airline.  Never again.US Airways is probably the worst airlines I've ever flown on. But I swear they usually offer the cheapest tickets. I put up with the bad customer service, delayed flight times, horrible inflight service, and outdated planes just because of the cheap price of the airline ticket.

What sucks even more is I am a rewards member with them. I have enough to book a one-way flight but they do not allow you to book one way flights with your mileage points. You would have to be charged round-trip.  What's up with that! Once I have enough miles to book a round-trip flight I will do so and then hopefully never fly US Airways again.

I say only fly US Airways is if its the cheapest by far or a last resort.Horrible!!!!!! The workers here at Sky Harbor Intl Airport in PHX are rude! Unbelievable! How is this company still going? I don't ever want to deal with them again. The lady that I had to go see was sassy and rude from the jump. Never again.My ticket had the wrong gate number, and once I was figured it  out I ran across 2 terminals to get let through the doors but I was not allowed on the plane. Don't trust your ticket Gate number, I was told to 'always look on the monitors'Our flight out of San Francisco was delayed due to maintenance issues. We were flying to Phoenix connecting to a flight to Puerto Vallarta. The delay would have caused us to miss the connection. At first, US Air suggested that we skip the first day (keep in mind, this is a prepaid vacation). They then rerouted us to fly out of San Jose International. I informed the rep that my ride will not be able to drop us off at San Jose and I'd have to park there. Also, the fact that we'd be flying back to San Francisco and I'd have to take a cab to pick up my car from San Jose. 
I was told that it would not be a problem and that I should file a claim once back from vacation. 
I filed a claim and all they can do is to apologize for the inconvenience and nothing else. 
Very disappointing...
Airport and flight crews were great.This is the WORST AIRLINE I've flown on in a long time. They're disorganized, rude, and there is very limited seating at their departure gates. Literally for a full flight there were 15 seats at the gate. I asked their service person why this was and she said 'because you'll get to sit when you're on the plane.' I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.One of the worst check in experiences at PHX, but very consistent with poor US Air check in processes across the country.  It is quite obvious that the layout designer and process engineer responsible for the check-in "corral" have zero practical experience in queuing theory and capacity planning that strives to remove bottlenecks not exacerbate then.  The check in in experience is poor and an in effective use of US Air personnel,  which undoubtedly impacted my high ticket price.CLOSED OUT OF BUSINESS as of 12-24-2012 per their sign at their vacant location.The food is good, but I got screwed there. I ordered the French toast and our waitress said, "would you like bacon or sausage?" So I said, "oh, wow. Well, sausage I guess." The check comes and I've been charged FOUR DOLLARS for the sausage I didn't even want. Beware!They did not do well. They totally screwed my order up and then just seemed indifferent to it. 
I should have known better.Was welcomed with wide open arms... No literally, the valet came out with his arms wide open and asked, "where do you plan to park this thing?"

To be fair, I showed up in an oversized Toyota Tundra and trailer... But I didn't expect that warm welcome.   I asked if he greeted all of his guests this way, and he realized that he came off as an ass and tried to correct the situation.

I ended up getting a parking space a half mile away, and walking back and forth to my vehicle.  

I'd recommend this hotel, as long as you live a straight forward, in-the-box life. We needed special accommodations regarding our stay. The manager assured me there'd be no problem and she'd get back to me.   She left for vacation without ever getting back to me. When I followed up I was told to literally go stay at the Sheraton, despite the fact that I was staying here as part of a very large conference, and had previously been told they'd make it work.  Not how I expected the situation to be handled. 

Pretty disappointed overall. The hotel was nice, but the people weren't. I'd recommend the Sheraton.The worse "Steak &Guinness Stout Boxty" -SUPER SALTY!
The service, not attentive and outright dismissive.

Absolutely not a place to come back if you are trying to get a decent meal. 

AVOID IT IF YOU CAN!If you are hungry this place is going to fix that.  Hugh piles of food that is bound to make you lose your appetite.  Cartoon versions of American style Chinese food but completely devoid of any color.  Skip this place and to Wong's instead.  Same style of food but with flavor and better prices. Sing High does have a better looking dining room.  Wong's looks scary.A real tragedy. A place that once excelled in concept, food and service as has taken a real nose dive. In the past, the food and atmosphere were wonderful. My latest experience went as such: Upon arrival, we waited for waitresses to stop chatting and seat us- a few minutes. Another 10 minutes to get a menu. Another 15 to order. About 20 to get simple breakfast food. 2 bites to determine my food was bad- rancid bad. Another 15 minutes to send it back and ask for the menu to order something new. Another 10 minutes to receive said menu. Another  15 or more for waitress to come and ask if I actually wanted to order something. At that point, I can honestly say I didn't. 

I won't be going here again unless 1) hell freezes over or 2) there is a public proclamation of new ownership/staff.I work downtown, so this is easy to get to by walking.  However, the owners are soooooo unfriendly!  The lady doesn't know how to smile or say hi, thank you, or have a nice day.  The wait staff isn't much better, they must be related to the owners!  When there are so many lunch choices downtown, I suggest you go some other place where your business is appreciated, especially in this economy.   Besides, the food is fair to average at best.  Don't bother, go across the street to Sticklers.Very upset with the service here. We showed up at 7PM to have a nice dinner before an 8PM show across the street. I'm still sitting here at 7:48PM and I do not have my food. We asked our sever to check on our order, was told it would be 5 more minutes and after 12 more minutes we still didn't have our food. Ended up canceling out order and paying for only our drinks. Stay away from this place!A nice museum, an interesting Hollywood themed exhibit, and a pleasant first ever art museum visit with a group of young adults -- all ruined by an exhibit attendant drunk with the power of his polo shirt and name tag. The obnoxious prick who was working on the third floor of the south building today should find something else to do. Cultivating art appreciation is not his forte, nor is working with the public. Thanks for permanently turning off my 17-24 year olds from art by confirming the stereotype of "art museum" as a snooty and uninviting place where they do not belong and are not welcome.In 2010 faced with parking problems, someone decided that after a feeble parking pass enforcement policy, a stunningly rude technique was the answer; I quit on the spot. The attitude was clear: the customer is last. ASU students crowded up the place, and many didn't have a basic grasp of gym etiquette (resting on equipment / talking on the phone, not wiping off sweat). Multiple poorly executed remodels inconveniencing the members, with increased fees afterwards. The residents will sometimes use the facilities, which I support, but there have been a handful of conflicts with the guests and staff. There is a cardio room that can serve as a sauna in the summertime (poor remodel ventilation planning). And the hours, closing early and often on holidays -- we're talking days at a time, not at all in line with their competitors. Replacing equipment with crap no one uses. They tried to make me jump through hoops to quit and the arrogance and red tape had to be put in check. Too big, too greedy, and too bad, you lost a long relationship.The staff is extremely Rude. The blonde older lady was Nasty to us and our kids.  We finally had to snap back when she was mean to our kids. We drove 2 hrs with our family it cost us over $50.00 to get in. Caught the last show, it wasn't a puppet show. Just old props and singing. My kids were disappointed. They are under 5 and also expected a puppet show. I will Never recommend this place. Is this what Pheonix has to offer? Horrible money grabbers!! don't talk to ppls kids diguisting "Ever" lady. Or the Parents.  Save your money ppl and catch a movie.i wish we could choose to rate them zero stars... the employees at easley's are the most rudest people i have ever encountered in my life. they definitely don't even deserve 1 star. i will never shop here again even if its the last costume store open around halloween. let me go ahead and tell you a little bit about what actually happened. a couple of days ago me and my daughter who is 10 years old went to easleys to pick out a halloween costume... my daughter knew exactly what she wanted to be and also knew what she needed. she asked an employee for help and this employee was very rude to my daughter. she had an attitude with her as if she was just not trying to help at all. i don't know this employees name but she was about 5'3/5'4 and she has very short blonde hair. the things she told my daughter was not professional at all. this employee called my daughter ugly to another employee, not knowing i over heard her say these nasty disrespectful things. i asked her to get her manager. which was also a big mistake. the manager was not even trying to hear my side of the story. she was very rude as well. i decided that filing a complaint with the store owner will not do us any justice. we went home and filed a complaint against the company with "bbb" and we also filed a report with the police yesterday. 


do not go here!! you will not get the best of customer service. i suggest going to party city, walmart, target, etc.My advice for future purchases is do not buy something online because it will not look anything like the picture shown. I hate to give them 1 star but I was not satisfied what so ever with the purchase I had made. I also upgraded the bouquet $10 hoping they would add more flowers. Instead I got more greens and less flowers. I paid $80 total for something totally different than what I picked online with less flowers. Picture posted to give you an idea.Except the car is in good sharp, there is no customer service.  When I was at different lane to get out, the AVIS associates was sitting at the gate without walk to my lane and check me out.  Instead, I have to back the car, move to the lane they were sat.  Speak with horrible tone and rude.  Moreover, they said if I pass 1 min of my return time, they will charge me for a extra day.  Avoid AVIS, Hertz gave me much better experiences.This place is weak! I've heard of and seen this place before ,was in area stopped for a sandwich today, worst people working there seriously rude! I paid 17 bucks for sandwich a side and two drinks for that price it's should be good and have great service, I was blown away bye how basically mean the people were and the sandwiches were totally regular nothing special I watched the guys basically throw my sandwich together with distain he even had to make it! I will never go there again and will tell everyone I know ,the place sucks!!!The service was horrible and the food was atrocious. It was worse than bar food. I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Pretty much paid $9 for a diet coke and I'm still hungry and have to find somewhere else to eat.Bummer my first bad thing to say about SouthWest Airlines. A gate agent in Phoenix last week would not give me a blue pass ( handicapped ) to board early.  She said I could upgrade for $40.00.  Seriously I have a handicap and I was so insulted and stressed.  I didn't want to argue with her as it embarrassed me.  Bad job SouthWest!!Never again! Departing from LAX our flight was canceled and had to book another flight and that one was delayed.. Now returning home the flight has been delayed about 3 times. Very annoyed and just seems like that can't seem to be on schedule for any flights!We order out from there once in awhile at work, and since the remodel, they act like the customer does not matter. First they got the order wrong, and then charged double for a couple of the items. When we called them to notify of the charges, they stated that this was the correct price and the ones on the internet menu are wrong. For a matter of $5 that they refused to refund and dismissed the issues with our order, they have lost at least 10 customers from our place of work as I will order from another place instead. Very very disappointed as I loved this place when I first ate there. At my old job, I ate there once a week. No mas!Love the food, but they changed to mandatory valet parking.. fail x 100

Really? Why? 

Fix this! At least one of the two lots should be self parking.Horrible I was double charged and when I called the next day I was told by the manager that they were "busy" and they would call me the next day to help me? Really that is not great customer service at all id i charge someone $120 I would think you would want to take care of them immediately. There food was fantastic but there customer service was horrible. Beware people they may overcharge you and say they will call you back at a later time to return your money never again!AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We went here for downtown pub crawl in search of the $1 drinks that had been prominently advertised. By $1 drinks, they actually meant $1 off overpriced glasses of shitty wine (with the "discount," Beringer White Zinfandel was only $7.50!). We made the mistake of asking Jason, the douchebag of a manager, to either honor the printed special or do *something* to make it worth our while to have gone there. Instead, Jason not only turned away our party of eight without offering any kind of special to make up for the false promise of $1 drinks, but also  gave us attitude for trying to take advantage of the pub crawl specials.  I don't think I've ever felt less welcome anywhere I've been.I have now learned to avoid The Network's Bar and Grill.

The main reason is the poor service.

Anytime anyone pops in staff should greet the customer

These folks ignore customers frequently.

SIX times this year I was TOLD that the Downtown partnership 20% discount is NO longer accepted - which is a bold face LIE.

The restaurant staff merely HATES to deal with their inept manager who HIDES the required computer card for this discount from them.

THANKFULLY there are DOZEN'S of options only steps away.

Although I've been to the Networks OVER 3,000 times since it opened some 15 years ago, it now will be my last stop if that.I haven't been in a while and I really don't plan on going back.  The Costco deal has risen from $299 for 2 years to about $70 more.  The gym is warm.  The A/C went out for a while last summer and they took a long time to fix it.  The biggest problem is that this gym really only cares about getting your money.  The trainers have quotas and will try and guilt you into buying more sessions and product.  I hear them talking only about sales tactics and quotas- never a thing about helping people.  The manager has sales one on ones in the cubicle bullpen in front of clients.  I would have given it 2 stars if it wasn't so warm when I go there.I have a membership to go to all the 24 hour fitness clubs since I work all over the valley. this is one that I have hit and now make it a point to NOT go there, even if it is convenient for me location wise. the main thing that bothers me is that it is kept at least 80 degrees. well if I wanted that, I would just go outside and get a workout. first of all , it is extremely hot to work out and secondly, the dressing rooms are even hotter. after a workout and a shower, I had to go to work. well I couldn't even dry off in the dressing room after the shower. it is so hot in there.  I drove to work with the AC blasting and still could not dry off.  I pay a lot of money to belong to 24 hour fitness. I can't believe that they can't keep the gym at at least room temperature!!! and lastly, I reach for some towels as i'm leaving and have packed my bag, but they can't even keep paper towels in the rest room / dressing room area. some other 24 hour fitnesses are better that this one. I hope the they improve upon this.Went on valentines day, place was empty... The only place that was empty! The service and server was great, meal was a disappointment, large portions and cheap prices! The place smelled like a old dish rag. This is not the same as I remembered from 10 years ago when I liked it. Too bad I really wanted to give this place a good review.Austin needs to find work elsewhere. Very very rude. Mr Pettiette should be made aware how disrespectful his son is.Dave S can kiss my heini .. I called them to ask if they fuel up regular unleaded gas before going down there and they said yes. They need to inform their customers correctly and label their tanks in addition so it's obvious what they are actually putting into your vehicle. By the way Dave, they put UNLEADED REGULAR fuel (not biofuel) in my tank to dilute the E85 (duh) after they realized they made the mistake. My service engine light has now come on thanks to these idiots.

You obviously work there Dave. Get your facts right.Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.The food here is awful.  I live next door so I thought I would give it a try.  When I was given a menu I was told that the prices were incorrect.  I ordered a combination plate and was charged $4 more dollars than what the menu price was making it $10.  Not sure if they tell that to everyone or just me?  Thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall Chinese place.  I would have been ok with the price if the food was good, but this was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted.  Everything was bland.  And I wasn't sure what the meat was (chicken, pork, pigeon, rat).  Even the fried rice was bad.  Avoid this place and go to Pei Wei up the street.  The food is a million times better and less expensive!The food here is pretty good but horrible service. We went for lunch on Monday and stopped in about 11:15. After ordering one person waited 50 minutes for their lunch. The table next to us waited just as long. 

We asked where our food was each time the waitress came by and they said there was a problem. After asking the 4th time and asking to speak to a manager, they said the manager was busy. 

If you don't mind waiting 50 plus minutes for lunch this is the place for you.I give this one star ONLY because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me, take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order. An apology for my order would have apparently been too much, instead I got a "are you sure you called this location"? Ummm... You have another location?? I've had better service at McDonalds.I bought over $18,000 worth of appliances from these people . Everything was great except the refrigerator which was suppose to be a new demo. The refrigerator arrived and appeared to be used. It had a big dent in the interior and part of the freezer was missing. We worked to correct the situation but the manager/ owner is a pompous ass that really doesn't care about the customer once he has your money.

Please deal with a dealer with great reviews. I wish I would have checked first.This hotel is a shit hole and so is Phoenix.  The area reminded me of a shittier version of Stockton surrounded by cacti.  Our rooms smelled like piss and sweaty gym socks. The check in clerk told us we have a view of mcdonalds as if it was a selling point.  OH SHIT A VIEW OF MCDONALDS? SIGN ME UP!  I slept in nasty sheets that had questionable looking stains (cum and blood).  My friends bed looked liked Patrick Bateman played fun with hookers and coat hangers the night before.  Also,  house keeping didn't replace my blood stained towel I used to clean my bloody nose with.

Short version: Phoenix hotel, blood and cum stains, sweat.Bread was stale today. I have eaten here before and it was muchbetter so I don't know if I just hit bad day or something else changed? Well i may give another shot in a month or so cause owner was very understanding. At the end of the day its not about nice ;but, it certanly does not hurt!If you don't mind your dental insurance and your own pocketbook paying for fancy furniture, spiral staircases and flat screen tv's over the dental chair then this is the place for you.  

yeah, they are friendly enough, but i wasn't impressed with the work.  the crown they put on my tooth fell out within a year; my new dentist said they never should have crowned it as there wasn't enough stable tooth to put a crown onto...i should have had an implant.  i think they just wanted my money in their own pocket instead of in the periodontist's pocket.  

Just not that impressed by the shiny "veneer" of this place (sorry, i couldn't resist).   find a dentist that knows their stuff and focuses on that instead of the foo-foo frills.As a preface in the past I've been happy with Open Wide Dental, and have been going here for almost 4 years now off and on, but a series of circumstances have left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. To begin back towards the beginning of the month I called them because I was having issues with one of my teeth and wanted a call back to see about any financing or if they could help me out in any way since I'm low income like they have in the past. No response after close to a week, this should have been my first sign, but I called again, they left a voice mail soon after with no real answer to my question, it was basically "We'll see, maybe, after you see us". Not really the kind of response I wanted since my concern was finances, what if I went in and they couldn't work with me now?

Anyway I took the chance (once again it is my fault for ignoring the signs) and called them back, made an appointment for a couple of weeks. The night before my appointment I became ill which was keeping me awake as well, so I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. To be fair it was past the normal 24 hr window (I left the message around 12 am because I knew there was no way I was going to feel good enough to go) cancellation I've ever made with them. I called them that morning to make sure they got my message, they did, and that was that. A week later I get a $50 "no show" bill sent to me. Which they have every right to do, but doesn't make it good business when you have a loyal customer who always shows up to their appointments, AND referred MULTIPLE people to their location. 

I was, of course, upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that I was a bit angry about it, but it was a civil message, even if I was clear that I would not pay the $50, that I felt it was a slap in the face, and because of our financial situation I would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasn't resolved. That was over a week ago and no response. So much for caring about your customers. If they are willing to lose me as a customer, and maybe future referrals, that is their prerogative but it seems like a bad move to do this over $50. But it seems consistent with my treatment I received with a lack of response prior to the $50 no show (which I didn't even know they had). 

Have to give them credit though, they did get my bill of $50 to me faster then any responses to my phone inquiries!

Update 6/10

Never heard back from them, but they were once again on time with sending me the same bill. Clearly they don't care about resolving issues with long time customers.I HATE THIS PLACE!!! I had the worst experience! I have a regular stylist who went back home to Chicago for the summer. I was approached about this salon and their new location. I called, explained my hair type and style and asked who would be best to serve me. The receptionist advised me which stylist would be best, and I booked the appointment. I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job. I should have walked out then, but I didn't. I told myself, "let's give the stylist a chance." I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures. I left in tears, she BUTCHERED my hair!! I was VERY disappointed, I will never step foot in that salon ever again! I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone! :(

I have been to different hair salons trying to find a stylist that fits me. I was hoping to finally end this long search. This is why despite my initial interaction, I decided to give the younger stylist a chance. I honestly, was hoping to find someone I could rely on regularly. My current stylist is always in and out of town. She has done this for many years and this is no longer a job to her its hobby so she's not always available.

This was a complete disaster, I left in tears and cried for 3 hours. I had to go to Fantastic Sam's near my home to help clean up the mess the stylist left me with. I wear a sassy short hair cut but not a MULLLET! With the extensive explaining, and pictures I for sure thought I would leave at the least satisfied or with something I could work with! I cannot do anything but wait for this disaster to grow out. I am devistated, and I would think twice, three, even four times before you take a risk at this salon. I will say this, the salon lay out is nice, and the atomosphere is upbeat however, the skills ARE JUST NOT THERE!!!I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE. 

The oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.

I usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech!
I won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos.No thanks!  I've ended up at charlies way too many times, because the "boys" always wanna go! But In my 15 visits to charlies I cannot think of even one time where I actually had fun! Never!   Stupid music and just all wrong!  No thanks Charlie!Sadly,  we had a horrible experience there tonight.

Let me start with some background:  I am a Phoenix native and have been to Mary Coyle's more times than I can count.  My sister worked there many moons ago and I live mere blocks away from the store.   I desperately want this to be a successful venture for the new owner and most of all I want a great go-to spot for my husband and my kids (grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.). I have a fantasy that this place turns into a great joint to bring clients for lunch and a solid place for food and ice cream.

Tonight, I went with kids.  Me and three kids to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  What could be better?  I wasn't looking forward to the dinner menu but I was hopeful that the new ownership had improved the mediocre food and the time we spent having dinner would pass without incident to get us to the main event:  ICE CREAM!!!

Here's what happened:  We were ignored for about 15-20 minutes before anyone came to our table.  At that time there were only two other tables with customers in the entire restaurant.  Drink orders were taken, crayons requested.  Drinks came two by two, crayons requested again and finally arrived.  Dinner order taken another 10-15 minutes later  and then dinner arrived.  The kids dinner of hot dogs all around (1/2 of a dog/kid) were well received though they could have stood an entire hotdog.  I ordered Chili.  The chili didn't taste bad but it unfortunately it didn't ,actually, taste at all.  The kids ate their food pretty quickly and I finished my 6 bites of chili (all I could do)  and was ready for the ice cream order.  

110 minutes after we arrived we got up and went to the register where our server and the manger were stationed.  No one had come to our table to ask how our food was, to refill our beverages, to clear our table, to take our ice cream order or to even walk past.  My kids went to the ice cream during this time and got samples of the flavors and had decided what they wanted to order.  We waited and waited and waited.  I called out a polite "excuse me" to no avail as our server walked by.  Finally from our booth I called a nearby ice cream shop to see if they had a wait.  I was told they didn't and I gathered my kids and went to the register to leave.  I said to my server:  "you never came back to my table, you never came back"  "we sat and sat and you never came to our table" she said to me:  "your total is $21.??".  That was it.  That was my evening out to celebrate my daughter's August birthday at my neighborhood joint with her brother and her best friend.  I'm stunned.  I want this to be a great place but I would settle for a good place.  I hope that one day it is that place but it will take some time for the bad taste in my mouth to go away.Disappointing.. I had out of town guests visiting, and we wanted some ice cream after our dinner. We were in the general area, and I had heard so many good things about Mary Coyles, that I suggested we try it out. My friends were impressed with the appearance of the place when we got there. It was about 815pm on Sunday night. The place was reasonably busy. After looking at the menues, We decided on a "Peak" which was listed as three flavors of ice cream with three different sauces for each scoop, and a simple sundae of Peppermint Bark Icecream with hot fudge. 

After waiting quite a while, our ice cream arrived. First shock--the Peak came in a tumbler, not in a boat or bowl. so it was three scoops of icecream (all different flavors) on top of one another, with the sauces all mixed in. To make matters worse, it was melted, so more like a milkshake instead of sundae. My peppermint bark sundae was also melted and mushy.  The three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes. When the waitress came around to check on us, we let her know that we were disapointed in both the presentation of the Peak, and the fact that both items were melty and runny. She offered to have them remade, but by this time, we just wanted to leave. She presented the bill with a 10% discount.. Woopty doo...No visit from a manager, no offer to take care of us next time... just a "here is your $1.25 off". So we ended up paying something like $12 for two runny, melted dishes (glasses really) of ice cream.One star is being nice.  This place has deteriorated more and more over the years, but today, the food was simply disgusting.  Yak isobar was not edible, smelled like vomit.  Dark meat with gristle and chunks of fat, and sweet and sour chicken soaked in oil and not even slightly crispy.  The place is dirty and the bathroom is filthy and stinks terribly.  I doubt this place is owned by the same people it once was....it is unacceptable.  Don't waste your time, money or appetite.  They do not deserve to stay in business.  I am only being honest and not trying to be cruel.  I hope they clean up their act, but it's hard to imagine at this point.Remember in the 90s when Kyoto Bowl was good and you could page your friend, he'd call you and you could ask him to stop by the Blockbuster to pick up Terminator II swing by the Kyoto Bowl and grab you a Teriyaki Bowl?  

Then that dude stole your girlfriend, you got an iPhone, Blockbuster closes virtually every store around, and Kyoto Bowl started serving awful food that smells like bile in a bowl.  

At least you still have Terminator II.....now on DVD with bonus features.  

If you're tempted to re-live the 90's at the Kyoto Bowl, just play some Pearl Jam and grow your goatee out instead.  You'll be happy you did.I stopped here in search of a place with decent sautéed noodles with tofu and this is what I found. I would not recommend this place. The man whom I assume is the owner of the place took about five minutes to approach the counter and ask if we were ready to order. He my order wrong and struggled to understand what I wanted. After partially eating the food I began to have a stomach ache. I blame the tofu as it looked undercooked and not only that it didn't have much flavor. I advise do not go there.Unfortunately, I must update my review based on my most recent dining experience at Mi Patio.  The BF and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a late dinner right before closing.  I have a cast-iron stomach and I almost never have problems with anything I eat.  

I ordered the taco salad with beef machaca.  When it arrived, the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result.  I surmise the beef had been left out to cool (probably for too long) since the restaurant was about to close.  Needless to say, a few short hours later in the middle of the night I came down with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced.  This wasn't "Oh, I don't feel so good" food poisoning.  This was, "Should I go to the hospital?" food poisoning.  It was so bad I was unable to travel for work the following week.  

Mi Patio is now permanently off my list of acceptable eateries; it's just not worth the risk.  Adios, Mi Patio!NIce place (the inside is better than what the outside would imply)  ... VERY clean ... Pino the owner (from Italy) seems like he's always there and KNOWS his customers ... and comes off as a real nice guy ... but saddly I found that my Pepperoni Pizza had virtually zero flavor ... the pizza looked GREAT ... the crust was fine ... but I'm totally into sauce and there was no flavor to it ... bummer ... still have yet to find GREAT pizza in Phx :(Can't believe they sell nazi items here.  Will never be back as well as their customer service and knowledge was  very poor.Well I gave them a chance based on the rave reviews below.   my mistake.  

I just got my garments back in worse condition than they were when I gave them over for cleaning.   there's a tear in one sleeve and another item looks like it was slept in it is so wrinkled.  
even when I asked them to press the item a second time they brought it back to me and said "oh she pressed it again" and of course it still looks terrible. I'll be doing my own pressing from now on since apparently I'm the only one who can get wrinkles out of linen.

When I voiced my concern, the quote unquote manager looked at me as if I were speaking German.  I'll not be going back.This is one restaurant that requires a make over in so many ways!
1). The interior is from another time, there is a sign that warns you to watch your children, and a sign on both bathrooms that they are out of order (although they are not, you just need a key).
2). The food is B.L.A.N.D!  THAT is the only word to describe it!  The catfish, the mushrooms (which were cut in half), the zucchini (which wasn't cut at all or didn't seem to be).  Cole slaw same thing as well as the tarter sauce!  Good thing they've got ketchup and hot sauce in a bottle to mix in the tarter sauce, that helps very little but it helps.  
3).The staff is nice but from another time! 

A yeah, we're NOT going back, and if there were a to give half a star I would!Saw such great reviews but was very disappointed. The Pho was overpowered with star anise and something else. Not very well balanced in flavors like I'm used to with Pho Thanh close by and homemade pho. I ordered the #1 and got maybe 1 edible piece of brisket and the rest was tripe. Read good reviews on the banh mi sandwiches but they were out of bread. I will most likely not be back again as it was memorable in a bad way.This place is a dump. IT'S NOT SAFE AFTER DARK!!!

I just stick to Target, Costco and the movie theater on the outside.

Don't bother going inside.Dirty bar that needs a rescue. Ordered drinks and served wrong drink and forgot 1/3 of the order then didn't finish the order. What a dump. I recommend finding a better dive bar.I wrote a review in the past and it has been removed!!!!!!!!!!!! Corporate greed?????? Anyway, these people are okay ,but if you get Dr Rich, your dog might be in pain for three weeks and if you complain on the internet about this, you might not be allowed to talk to the doctor and you might have to have your consultation in the waiting room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You will be treated differently if you complain on here. Plus, I tried to call about it, never heard back. I told the receptionist about it and she said there was a problem with him and he was gone. Our last appt there, he was the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did not say anything. I just am never going back.One star is to much for this location.    This Pizza Hut is a joke.  Not only was my order 35 minute late from the estimated time but they brought the wrong order.   I called and spoke to the manager I believe her name was Samantha ,  and I can see why this place is a joke.   I love Pizza Hut but I will never order from this location again.  Hell I may never order Pizza Hut again.   I'll give my money to dominos .What-a-disater

My very first experience at a Whataburger and I can not believe the variety of ways they managed to screw it up.

I was the only person ordering but this place was such a disorganized, chaotic mess that ordering a meal took a solid 5 minutes and required two employees and a Manager.

I got my meal and immediately realized that they'd gotten my order wrong. O...K, less fries and a larger drink are probably fine.

But I got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese isn't melted. the jalapenos have no kick and the whole thing is smothered in the cheapest most repulsive American style mustard you've ever eaten.

I check out the fries and realize there is a 1 to 1 ratio of salt to potato. I have to roll them in a napkin just to make them palatable.

And the strawberry shake tastes like a cold chemistry experiment.

I hate wasting food but I looked at each item and had no interest in any of it so I gave it back to them and asked for a refund. 

The Manger didn't hassle me about the refund and I considered a second star but the food was just too bad to justify it.

2013 #1 / 365This place embodies all of the problems that can befall a hole in the wall restaurant and none of the charm.  The dining area was filthy!  The blinds on the windows where literally covered in dust and some sort of ancient splattered liquid.  Their was a television in the corner of the dining area blaring some inane program that the staff was watching.  We sat at our table for ten minutes without anyone so much as acknowledging our presence.  Finally one of my companions got up and dragged a woman back to our table to take our order.  The food came and our waitress sat watching her program for a half hour before we had to once again leave our table and pull her over to get refills on our drinks and get our check so we could leave.  I had the pho which was bland and lifeless and my companions shared a pho and a crispy noodle dish which wasn't half bad.  I would say avoid this place at all cost.We were at a wedding last night and sharko's staff was talking so loud that we could not here the minister over them. The staff was very organized and looked like they knew what they were doing. I said looked!  The waiters never bothered to fill my water glass. They didn't clear any plates until the evening was over. 
          Ok now the food. REALLY bad. First of all the green beans tasted rubbery (which to me means frozen). The mashed potatoes were definitely out of a box. The beef was very dry and could only be eaten if u had the horseradish sauce on it. Ok so I thought to my self well they can't mess up a salad. I was wrong. The lettuce was wilted and the dressing tasted like Kraft. 
      Recommendation dont us this company if u like good food or good service.I went to this place because I had a restaurant.com certificate but they did not honor saying that the owner did not authorize it...which is fine i can get a refund. Anyway i love seafood...we ordered and it took a while to start getting our food. I got the coctel de camaron which was ok. Then my husband got his botana de camaron con pulpo...it was so small for the price i couldnt believe it! It tasted good though...my biggest dissappointment though was the ceviche de camaron...the moment i saw it i knew i was not going to eat that...it was so raw...like completely raw...i returned it and was told its because it takes a day to cook ot completely with the lemon...youre telling me? Ive been eating this all my life i know jow to make ceviche and it takes an hr or a little more...but its a restaurant it shouldve been ready for customer. People were nice...but wont be returning...at least to this location. Ill stick to Mariscos Playa Hermosa or Islas de Capitan both in Phoenix.I haven't seen a motel this scary since The Shining. Room 325 stunk, and 326 stunk worse. The beds must have been slept in by sumo wrestlers. The 2nd floor walk way  was slightly bent, and felt like it was going to collapse. The AC was noisy. I'm a little surprised  we didn't see ghost.

The bathroom looked clean, except for a mold stain behind the toilet. The staff was friendly and attentive. Perhaps not too strange, the clerk didn't ask us how are room was.So... this is what happens when you open the only Dim Sum restaurant in the dessert... utter chaos.

Dim sum normally has large quantities of selection of food constantly moving around the restaurant in carts. You see what you like, you pick it, you eat it. Portions are small so price is decent.

The quality of food here was terrible. But come on, you say, this is fracking Phoenix! What did you expect? Fine fine fine. I'll stomach cold dim sum that was suppose to be hot, chewy meat instead of tender, and bland instead of flavorful...

The place is a dump and the line is 40 minutes long. Well, it is the only dim sum place no? 

The chaos though that is inside is what get's the place a 1 star. First off I don't even see how this place is setup for Dim Sum. The tables are arranged in a maze like formations where the carts can't even get to you.

Forget the fact that the carts can't reach you, most patrons got up and chased them down and brought back their own food. In the end we didn't even get most of what we wanted cuz they sold out. One of the employees shrugged his shoulders and told us next time to chase down we want to get instead of waiting. 

Totally not worth the wait, especially since the food quality was terrible.DO NOT SHOP HERE!
Went in here hoping to get help, admitting I didn't know much and they made me feel stupid. Very rude, short, and too cool for school. If you want good service goto bobs used motorcycles. I would rather throw my bike in a ditch then spend another dollar here, amazed they're still in businessI waited to write this review to let my nerves and emotions calm down, but in all honesty they have not. Worst experience ever. I'm just glad me and my son are alright.These guys seemed very nice, and they came out and gave me a quote for stump grinding. I had 2 trees that I hadn't cut down yet, but was planning to upon receiving the quote for the stump grinding. I needed to make sure I could afford it. I received a very reasonable quote from Harris and Sons and went ahead and cut the trees down and called them back to schedule a time for them to grind the stumps a few days later. I spoke directly with one of the guys and he said they would check their schedule for the following week and call me back. No one called me back. I called again and this time I left a message with their answering service. No one called me back.

So, I guess I need to find a new company to do the work. Unfortunately, I budgeted for the quote Harris and Sons provided and I am finding that the work is much more expensive. I wish I wouldn't have cut my trees down- I could have waited until next year, but I knew the trees were declining and since Harris and Sons provided a reasonable quote I thought I should get it taken care of now. 

I give Harris and Sons one star, because while I appreciate them coming out and giving me a quote in a timely manner, not returning calls or honoring the quotes- is really crappy. I am feeling pretty sad looking at my barren front yard with big tree stumps sticking out like eye sores.Don't let the name of this place fool you. They may be a cheaper grooming but they're certainly not better. We've taken our cat here a few times because of their reasonable pricing but I'd honestly rather pay more for better results.

The last time we took her to this place, they cut her whiskers. Pretty sure that's not how this is supposed to work but we made the mistake of giving it one more shot. We received a call at 4:30 p.m. today after having dropped her off at 11:30 to be told that "not even four people could hold her down" long enough to get her properly groomed. That's odd; not only is our cat super mellow but she doesn't have claws in her front paws (not our doing. We adopted her like that). The only good thing about this visit is we weren't charged for the hack job they did. 

Please keep this in mind before you go here.I have lived in this apartment for over a year and I started off with a one bedroom and after months I have upgraded to a two bedroom unit and I was placed on the second floor of the leasing office. My stay was going great until the office manager started to complain about foot steps, water running in the shower was too loud, and my dogs barking when they are at play. Then, it left me with no choice but to end my lease with grievance and was pardon for the breach of contract.To top things off, I haven't even handed them the keys back as I was still packing and to my surprise the apartment was cleaned out and noone had a say to where my belongings went. However, the previous staff whom were Samayah and Tracy had made my stay very comfortable and made it enjoyable with their daily greetings. But, soon management had let them go and i felt even more hostile living there because I still walked on eggshell each day. Management was very poor and corporate was the same way as well in handling any situation. I wouldn't even rate this place with one star at all but being that it had to I had no choice.CLOSED!!!  Drat!!!This place keeps getting more and more ghetto! I will not, repeat will NOT visit this store after dark by myself. Hire a security officer already! 

Not only does the clientele leave something to be desired, the selection is awful! I will drive to Safeway on 7th St and Glendale (at least 8 more minutes away from my house) just to not have to visit this store. It's a shame that the closest large grocer to my home is so horrible. 15th Ave and Northern is a really nice area, yet the closest super market is awful. I just don't get it?!Went there with my husband and 2 kids. We are of Mexican decent and in there all you see is white people. They look at you weird or you catch them looking at you and pretend they weren't. Now for our waitress, I hate when she serves us. She is so snotty and looks at us bad she seems like she has no patience for Hispanic people because once she turns around to a table with white people she is all smiles. I just feel so uncomfortable at that place that every time my husband wants to go I remember her. I gave it a last chance this weekend and still the same.  She's a white woman with green or blue eyes and red short hair.. just warning you if your Hispanic and you go there. If you are Anglo she will like you. Now for The food. . Its alright but doesn't have the real Mexican food feeling to it. The rest of the people who work there are nice and give you chips and salsa.. which I do like the salsa! Hope that if you go there you don't feel as uncomfortable as I do in there. The weird part for me is that I feel so uncomfortable in a "Mexican food"  and I'm Mexican. To be honest I do not recommend it the food is not worth going through what I did. Sorry Los compadres but I gave you many chances.This Place stole my Money! I paid my rent on the 3rd they sent me a 5 day notice saying i didn't pay and that I had to pay with a money order, so i did  couple days later i saw that have deposited my rent check from the 3rd and the money order, so they got both of them, now trying to get them to pay me back and they giving me the run around, this place is bad i mean people being killed there, roaches, bugs, people getting heir place broken into. and they wanna charge u 600 - 800 to live there... WOW, looking for a place to move into this is not the place trust me, Management sucks big time...I regret moving here. Once you're a tenant the management could care less about you. 

Your property was stolen? Well that definitely isn't the property's fault especially since they never shut the gates and nothing is ever locked. 
The maintenance guys rarely do anything around the property and it takes them two weeks to respond to a maintenance request. We had one of them tell us not to drink the faucet water but it was okay for the water to come out cloudy. 
We made a complaint that our neighbors let their dogs poop on their porch and don't clean it up even though the heat makes the smell worse. That was 2 weeks ago and still nothing. 
I asked two months in a row why are payments banned from being paid online. This is my third month asking and emailing and still no response. If I go into the office all of them will look around at each other like they're at a loss for words, not knowing how to run a proper business.
We've had people rummaging through the trash cans looking through people's trash for god knows what. In June, they was a couple peaking in peoples' porches and cars. 

I honestly do not feel safe here and if I could afford something else I would move in a heart beat. DO NOT MOVE HERE!Won't be long before this place goes under. Hole in the wall doesn't always mean good food. Tried the Beef Pho, hands down worst Ive ever had. Beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it. No aroma and the 'salad' was pathetic, no basil.. what's that all about? I didn't try the other dishes which might be unfair. However I will not be back to try anything else, just not worth it to me!Closed and re-opened.  Completely different ownership.  New place has better food, same cheap prices.  Had a bad experience with the manager, but when you can get a big bowl of good pho, so be it.  I will review under the new name after I go there again and hopefully the manager/server is gone.Bad service. Really really bad. Food is okayDON'T stay here! I don't care how cheap it is! Scary. Dirty. Scuzzy people. Run down interiors. Missing items. Go 1/2 to 2 miles north on I-17 and you can find a hotel just as cheap and much nicer. The other 2 reviews are 1-2 years old. I live in Glendale/Phoenix and only rented a room here for New Years Eve night. I wanted to have minimal driving to do on New Years and rented this close by room. I only live 6 miles from this hotel. I've lived in AZ 33 years and the immediate area. The area is good. The hotel it self is scary, dirty, old on the interior, felt very unsafe, has drug addicts walking around and a lot of scary long term people renting from here. There were 3 holes punched in our bathroom door, the microwave was missing, all the pots and pans were missing, there was no iron, no ironing board, no closet door, dirty lamp shades, dirty bathroom sink and sink top, and there were only 2 forks, 2 plates, 2 spoons, 2 mugs, 1 spatula, 1 glass. It was also a very small room. There is no living area and there are 2 chairs at the kitchen counter. On the outside, the hotel is very pretty and very deceiving. The lobby is directly at the entrance when you pull in. I paid and drove around to my room. I wish I drove around first. There were obvious drug addicts standing in the parking lot, lots of really scudzy people came out of their rooms looking at me while we were looking for our room, and we immediately felt unsafe. I've stayed at about 250 hotels and have never felt unsafe. As soon as I walked into my non-smoking room, you could smell an old cigarette stench. This is suppose to have a fully equipped kitchen. The microwave was gone and all the pots and pans. I immediately went down to the front desk and told them. They said "Oh yeah, that's the room missing the microwave". They said they would try to find me some pots and pans and didn't. They did bring a microwave to the room and offered to move us. This is obviously a hotel that charges to very cheap monthly renters and shady looking people.  We drove both of our cars to this hotel and were worried about parking in front of our room. We parked our car in front of the office for safety reasons. It's a good area. Just a bad hotel.  We were just going to grab our stuff and not stay the night, but because it was New Years Eve, we didn't want to be on the roads. There's lots of other hotels very close by. Skip here.Ok, here's the deal:
I read the mostly glowing reviews and got a buy one get one free that I can use for lunch. That's a deal!
BUT--------------
When I ordered, it seemed like a high ending price with tax for a $7 lunch special. The waitress' answer? I had to pay tax not only for the $7 lunch plate but also the entree I got free! So I paid nearly double the tax (ripoff) especially the tax for something I didn't order. How does that figure?
The food-got stomachache later on. The seafood tasted like plastic, like it came from a plastic bag or, worse, been in the freezer for a while. Only the beans had flavor.

Save your money and go to Taco Bell.Dear Manager,
It is a bad idea to argue in the foyer with a customer who is complaining about how long it took for their to go order. In addition, I suggest you find the source of the vomit-like smell that was the ultimate reason we didn't even wait to be seated.Sometimes even a home baker just wants someone to bake for them. 
I have not been in Phoenix long so I am searching out the non-chains for baked goodies. My fellow yelpers assisted in my choosing Karl's and was on my way home from an errand. 
I decided to give the Napoleon, eclair and cookies a try. I placed the box of goodies in my cooler (yep, I carry one in my trunk quite often now that I live in hot as heck Phoenix and a bakery may be on my way to where ever - anal some would say) for the trek home. 
I started with the eclair. I pierced the puff with my fork into the puff and it cracked. Not a good sign. Too hard. Custard was gummy and not pleasing so I stopped after the first forkful. 
On to the Napoleon. It was not layers of pastry and custard. It had the top and bottom pastry and a singular thickness of custard. I pierced the top layer with my fork and it did not break through the pastry and most of the custard squished out. The custard looked curdled inside was dried on the outside and I tried to cut it from the side. I went with a knife at this point. I cut a piece and ate it. The pastry was soggy and the custard was dried out (like old). I did not eat more than the forkful. 
A cookie next. Karl's had a beautiful selection of decorated cut out cookies. The frosting was very sweet (and I like sweet). The cookie was coarse and crumbly, yet seemed a little stale. I only had a bite of that, too.
Now, this was a Tuesday. I would expect everything to be fresh. It just did not seem that way. I was very disappointed. Sorry, won't be back.We have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVER

I am talking about 9-10 years worth...Why oh why is it so hard to find good Chinese food in this town?  The two behind the counter at this place are Chinese - please don't tell me you eat the garbage that you serve to the masses in Phoenix as Chinese food.

I should have read the previous review because I had a simple beef with vegetables (how could that be screwed up?)  Hardly any beef, the veggies were all previously frozen.  The pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish.  The pork is cut into tiny pieces and are extremely fatty - I'm not even sure it's pork.  I did see a dead cat not far from the front door, maybe he will be on tonight's special menu?

Wahsun is not too far down 19th Ave - GO THERE INSTEAD, this place SUCKS!I would like to write a review about the service at this store, but I can't. I waited ten minutes for someone to help me before I decided to leave. When I walked in I was greeted by someone helping a customer who said he would be right with me. He finished with his customer, went into the shop and was not seen again. I hope he has been found. Next in walked another employee with a customer. He told me that I would be helped shortly. While he was finishing up with his customer, he answered the phone, put them on hold and completed his transaction. He then went to the phone call which came in a while after I had been standing there. I guess a phone call is more important tan a live breathing body in the store. He did request someone come and assist at this time, but I had waited long enough. Based on the picture on the wall, the second employee was the Manager Frank. As I was walking to my car, an employee came out to ask if I needed help. That would have been nice while I waited inside. I told him no thank you that I was done. He then asked if I needed an air check or a flat. I told him that actually I wanted a new set of tires. He asked that I return to the store and he would get me a deal. I want good customer service when I go into a store, not the promise of a deal for poor service. I guess I should mention that I have been a customer of Discount Tire for fifteen years, and have always been satisfied. I have also always shopped at the Scottsdale Store, which although much busier, is run in a much more customer friendly manner.I wish I could give no stars. DO NOT EAT HERE!! I got HORRIBLE food poisoning from here. I didn't know of Yelp a year ago when I got it to write a review. It had to have been from the tomatoes in the salsa bar, because my coworker got the same thing as me but different salsa.Very misleading, advertising $49.00 and then changed the price.  The staff wasn't accomadating, the place was dirty and no security that we saw.  Our patio door (on second floor) was unlocked when we arrived. This place is worse than a Motel 6 with the price of a 139.00, so I wouldn't say it was affordable to the average person.  There was no clock, no blow dryer, no TV remote for either TV, no iron but an ironing board (they said people steal them) but for 140.00 they could buy more?  You could throw a cat out around the door.  This was a suite? but where a sofa should have been they had put in 2 double beds and as a result you tripped over the bed everytime you went from room to room.  The bedskirt was way to big for the bed under which I found the attachment for a inflatable mattress and other paper.  The bath towel made a good loofa!  The blankets were really thin.  Never again!!  Our Tom Tom said it was a Comfort Inn but obviously not any more.  The WiFi was spotty.  I found the front staff not that helpful.  If we had known what it was, we wouldn't have stayed... but it was 11:30 and we were tired.  AVOID IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO IT, There is a whole bunch of other hotels just down the street.I'm fairly surprised at how many good reviews on this are here. This place was absolutely disgusting! The food was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting for a couple days. We should have known better when we walked in and the owner was sitting there picking his ear! The waitress lady was nice but the food was horrid and we all felt sick afterwards. This place was recommended by a friend and now I have to murder her! STAY AWAY!First bad review I've ever had to give Manuel's and it hurts my heart! I ordered 2 portions of albondigas over the phone for a to go order as I just had surgery. Both portions were broth & veggies, NO meatballs at all! My nephew called to let them know & to get some & the woman who answered the phone ARGUED that there were meatballs in it! Really? Can u show me, cuz I know what a meatball looks like & I sure don't see any!
The broth & veggies is very tasty, but would be so much better with meatballs & I am just so upset that the woman argued with my nephew, that's terrible TERRIBLE customer service!My wife saw this restaurant on DDD and has been wanting to go for a long time.  My kids and I finally gave in.  The restaruant was clean.  There were two tables filled.  My youngest ordered chincken wings, which took 45 minutes.  Oh, by the way, we all had finished eating already.  I ordered the nachos grande, which had cold meat, cold cheese (not melted) and watery guacamole.  My other kids and wife all ordered beef chinmichangas, which my oldest asked if the meat was meat.  She my son asked if he would trade his chimi for my nachos, which I reluctantly did.  The chimi was vile.  I would rather have skipped that meal and gone right to bed.  Would never go again and hope the staff member at DDD who found this place gets reassigned to a desk job.No!

I said - NO!!!My family and I have been going to the Taco Bell at 1909 W. Deer Valley for years. Last Thursday night my Dad went through the drive through, we got our usual, they messed up the order and did not give him a mexican pizza and got mine and my Mom's order right. While eating the taco salad, I looked down to find a bug about the size of an ant crawling out of my salad. I promptly stopped eating my salad and told my Mom I was going to call Taco Bell to see if I could get my money back. All the manager said was "that he could give me another salad (why would I want another salad) and a free drink." I said no thank you. I think you should check the rest of your food for bugs.
My advice for people when they go to this place, check your food before you start eating it.It's been awhile since I've been in this particular Macaroni Grill. That's probably good since I was able to note the significant decline in the food and service.

I was there for lunch. Arrived at 12:45 pm. Slightly less than 50% occupancy in the dining room. My wife and I were seated immediately by the manager who was busy working the tables. As I was about to be seated in the booth, I noted the booth seat was covered in crumbs. The manager wiped it down remarking the busser didn't wipe it down (considering I hadn't seen a single busser, the manager was the one bussing tables).

I ordered the center cut lamb spedini and garden salad. The server asked if medium rare was okay since that's how it's normally served. I was fine with that. Salad arrived fairly promptly but I quickly noticed it was far from fresh. looked like bag salad about 3 days old. Wilted on the edges, limp and of generally unappetizing appearance. I sent it back without requiring a replacement.

Main course arrived and first cut revealed it was well done. I cut a few more. Well done too. Wait...I thought she said medium rare? Cool pink center remember? The server asked how it was and I told her not what was ordered. She returned it (kept the veggies to eat while new lamb was brought back). Replacement came out perfect and was juicy and tender. Previous was quite dry which led me to believe they're pre-cooking their meat, hence the well done as soon as it's heated up.

Manager never came to the table for either the salad or the lamb. in most places, the manager is required to authorize any reissue on plates. I would have been at the table in an instant to ensure I met the customer's concern/complaint. I think he was too busy making busy work. I noticed him walking around quite a bit but only sliding plates around in the kitchen window or placing salt and pepper shakers nicely. He was clueless and it showed in food quality and service. He was sweaty down the back of his shirt which may be fine for McDonalds, but not for a restaurant.

Years ago this was an ememplary dining establishment. Based on recent service I don't expect it to survive unless serious management is brought in.Worst bar in the N. Phoenix! Get rid of your regulars and maybe you will see some real business! You need to clean up too! The place smells like you have bar rot!!We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their "country comfort food" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants.I utilized Wade & his company a couple of years ago to have repairs done. Capacitor as well as a motor replaced. "Never Again"!!! The capacitor was never secured ...laid up against the empty box it came in. I had a Rosie on the House certified technician come out to do a tune up in April of this year and disclosed this to me. Not only did he share this with me but also informed me of a exposed wire.  No. ThanksSo I have been into this place twice and both times left me swearing I was gonna torch the place. If you ever want a good example of how not to treat customers this would be it. The  manager was even arrogant and rude. First time we went in we got a set of glasses that weighed a lot so i managed to get the cart into middle of the street before the front end manager came running out the door to tell me that I must bring the cart back. I asked her if I could just take my glasses to the car laughing and saying they were heavy. she replied absolutely not, bring it back inside now. so I left the cart in the middle of the street and walked away with my purchases and told her to get it herself if it was that big a deal for her. She shouted happy holidays to you too. I flipped her off and walked away. The next time I went in with my 14 year old cousin. As I am walking in I had a coke in my hand from one of the restaurants there and I was told i needed to not carry it through the store. The security guy told me he would hold it for me If I liked. I told him I was done with it and asked if they had a trash can at the counter. They told me I would have to go back outside the store to throw away the soda. Exceptionally rude the whole time I went to another store and will not be returning to shop there ever again.We placed an order at 735 and asked if they delivered to our address. They said yes, for $3. They also said it would be 40 minutes. An hour later...we called to find out where our food was! The guy who answered said "oh I was just getting ready to call you...I can't deliver to you. Its too far." Um, OK! Way to run a bad business buddy and keep your word! The ratings here aren't even that good but we thought we'd try it since they supposedly delivered to deer valley road. BTW, if you are in our area, Pronto Pizza does deliver, FOR FREE, and their ratings are better than this dump. Thanks for nothing, pink lotus!!!Please don't waste your time or money. Ate here twice, years apart and got food poisoning both times. Horrible, just horrible. Save yourself.I just got off the phone with the receptionist and didn't even get past the inquiry before deciding this company was not for me.  I called to ask about their services.  She told me that the person in charge was in a meeting and she wanted to obtain some of my information.  We proceeded to go through how many bed/baths I have, square footage, number of stories in the home, kids, pets, and then she started repeating the same questions like she forgot she already asked them. I told her we already went over those questions and she continued to ask them. Obviously very disorganized and not a great first impression.  I won't trust a person who keeps saying "Duuuuh" over the phone with my house.
NO THANK YOU!!It's hard to find a good vet now days- one that shows compassion, one that follows up, one that is thorough in communication.

My family has been taking their cats here since I was a preteen- back when Krista (I think that's her name) was running the place. So, when I moved back to Arizona this is the first vet I decided to take my cat to see.

My cat has IBS and has for years and lately her symptoms have worsened and have been causing her severe pain. The new vet at Larkspur cat clinic saw my cat and he recommended two medications to ease her pain and inflammation.

Now, when he gave me these medications he didn't mention any cautions or side effects. Didn't say to watch out for anything in particular- he just told me that they would help relax and ease the pain. So, I went home and I gave these medications to my cat. Within a couple hours she looked drugged up and out of it. She was acting quite strange and after 2 days she was very constipated and straining to the point that she was crying in pain. 

I decided to look up the medications prescribed and every single website I went to (and I went to a bunch) said that both medications are used in dogs- one of the dog medications was commonly administered to dogs in 17-23mg dosages- which my cat's dosage was 43mg (seems a bit high for a 6 pound feline), and the other medication had repeated warnings that it was controversial for cats and I read several times that is should NEVER be used on cats because it can cause constipation and blockages that can lead to disease and death, or something to that effect.

At this point I called the clinic and I explained my cats odd behavior and the constipation and straining. I also mentioned the medication and told them that I understand if there was a reason that the cat was given this type of medication, but was concerned because I read that there were side effects associated with this drug in cats and my cat was straining a lot and seemed out of it. 

The woman told me the doctor was busy and couldn't take my call. So, I asked if he could please call me back before 4PM that day because I was very concerned about my cat (it was 9 AM when I called), . The woman literally... LITERALLY, snickered out loud, condescendingly, and snorted that the doctor was very busy and she'll 'see'... ~click~

Anyhow, the vet NEVER called. Surprise!

I have found a new vet- that so far has been very good to my cat. They follow up and check in and make sure my cat's symptoms aren't getting worse. I showed the new vet and the nurses the medication that I was given to administer to my cat. They were all shocked. First, one of the medications are these huge capsules- they are people sized. The first comment I heard was, "I've never seen medication in that format... for a cat". The other medication I was given were broken pills. Again- everyone was shocked by the format of the medication alone.

The new vet said she was unfamiliar with using the 2 medications on cats. I could tell she didn't want to say anything negative, so instead she told me to give  her a couple days to research the drugs and she'd let me know whether or not it was safe to give to my cat.

A day and a half later I get a call from her. She says one of the meds is probably ok, but if the cat hasn't gotten better from it- don't give it to her. The other one- she said she didn't feel comfortable with me giving it to the cat and asked me not to. 

I will NEVER go back to Larkspur Cat Clinic. From giving me dangerous drugs (it seems like they buy what's on sale and give it out generically even if it's canine medication) that could kill my cat, no warning to the many possible side effects and complications to the dangerous dog medicine prescribed for my cat, then the horrific service- (Who condescendingly laughs at you when you are calling to say that your cat is having a bad reaction to the medication your doctor recently prescribed?) and then the fact that they NEVER called back- not to return my call, not to follow up, not to give further direction. I can't believe I paid $100 for this! They charged me almost $40 for the bad meds as well. 

I'm actually filing a complaint with the state board, and I told my family about what happened and we are all switching vets. I don't know what happened to this place, but it's not what it used to be.Went to this location for 2 yrs for oil changes and occasional miscellaneous repairs with no problem.  Once I got a 'new" used car, I went in for oil change and for them to look it over and came away with a 4 page repair list!!!  I have never gone back there.  I have gone back to dealer as well as a Midas location to verify the things on the list, they did find 2 things wrong, neither was on Firestones 4 pages of repairs and everything that was in the 5 pages was total BS.....I have never gone back!UGGGHH ~ DON'T do it!!! I really wanted 2 like this place but it's not a 'Gr8' anything except @ giving violent lengthy sessions praying 2 the porcelain gods as a result of giving them a try (a gamble I was pretty quickly sorry 4 having taken if it weren't 4 my lunch companion's insistence).

   I wasn't expecting much & everything I tried seemed 2 b @ the right temp & most items ranged from decent-good tasting, but 15 min8es in I fell ill w/ severe pain & loud thunderous disapproval stemming from my extremely unhappy stomach. Not sure exactly what the culprit(s) were, but I noticed the lo mein noodles were far greasier than they looked present8ion~wise b4 being on my pl8. I also had some green beans & mixed veggie dishes in addition 2 some EFY, couple bites of an imit8ion crab looking casserole, & a couple Crab Puffs w/ the red sweet n sour sauce. Whatever disagreed w/ me certainly gave me a 'sour' stomach & such painful forceful heaving that I thought I'd literally c my guts coming up any moment as I felt pretty much turned inside~out.

   I wasn't intending 2 visit their restrooms as I have a gr8 disdain 4 public 1s (which turned out 2 b a 'case~in~point' why) but it was either that, or lose it all @ the table. If u need 2 throw up, the condition of the bathrooms or even on ur way 2 them will easily push u over the edge (not that I needed it as I barely got there w/o cre8ing a spectacle as it was). Funky rancid stench & stepped on fortune cookies etc carelessly left in ur path on ur way there as u pass kitchen/janitorial workers who r 2 busy hanging around the soda fountain thinking it's a QT.

  Do urself, ur body & health a favor of skipping this place. I've never been so sorry as I was yesterday 2 give the benefit of the doubt 2 an establishment  by unknowingly risking myself in the process. I guess it coulda been worse = by spending full amount instead of the discounted price (thx 2 a coupon) 2 get an instant case of food poisoning. I wouldn't wish this on any1 & this has got 2 b the most Excruci8ing bout I've ever encountered ~ & I've experienced a couple b4!! Service was ok, interior outd8ed & in desper8 need of an upgrade (esp the latrines which were equivalent 2 rest~stop bathrooms @ best)!!

   Well, can't say I didn't give them a shot but take heed, ur better off not giving them the same chance I gave 2 prove I shoulda been more cautious about the neg8ives st8ed in previous reviews....... This is a case of shoulda stuck w/ my 'gut' so I could keep mine, instead of being talked in2 something against my better judgement..... ;-(Don't ever make this mistake. I currently live here, and after the maintenance technician finally used the last straw that broke the camel's back I am here to put forth the reasons not to live at Renaissance Apartments.

"24 hour maintenance for emergencies" is what they advertise, unless it's inconvenient. The repairman decided **that we don't need air conditioning** (It is 110 degrees right now) until tomorrow. We have lived without A/C for a full day now, and will surely enjoy our long night's sleep. His excuse is that he has to go get a ladder and that will have to wait until tomorrow. Apparently 650 for a one bedroom isn't enough money to convince the landlord to hire a maintenance technician who actually does his job. Instead, he threatened to fine me if I try to fix it myself.

The dog park they advertise is actually a walled off area with gravel, where teenagers hang out to smoke weed throughout the night.

Expect a poorly built bathroom. It will look great when you move in, but it takes less than a month for the cheap caulking they use to peel away, which in turn will cause disgusting stains that can't be removed.

You have better options than Renaissance apartments.Very UNFRIENDLY staff. Pulled into the parking lot at 8:30 pm and was checking in on Yelp about this Crowne Plaza, when a security guard rapped upon my driverside window and asked me if I was a guest or not. I JUST pulled into the parking lot! After speaking to him, he continued to call 'it in' taking my license number and speaking to his 'hq'.' NICE way to scare off business! Not up to par with other Crowne Plazas I stay at. Spoke with the night manager at the front desk, and no butt kissing from her about the harassment (like it was standard operation procedure for them) Needless to say I'm up the road staying at a Hyatt. Congrats, for pissing me off and ruining a nice evening for me.I am always hesitant to give restaurants bad reviews because many times bad reviews are just odd occurrences. La Parrilla Suiza; however, not only failed to deliver quality service, but the food was a nightmare. I ordered a water, two fish tacos, and a side of rice; a simple order for most Mexican restaurants. It took close to 45 minutes for a waitress to get me my water even after I repeatedly asked for it. My food was delivered after an hour and a half and it matched the services quality, which was horrendous. My fish tacos consisted of a cold tortilla, one fish stick per taco, lettuce, and avocados (which I asked to have removed). It was such a joke I just ate the fish sticks with my hands. The rice was the only thing that was mediocre. My meal experience was poor as was the guests around me, who routinely waited over an hour for the meals only to be presented with sub-par food. 

Overall the service was incredibly disorganized and poor and the food was worse than what a four year old with an EZ-bake oven could make.I could no longer resist this goofy, red and white striped, old-fashioned sandwich shop. When the craving for a good sandwich kicked in, I decided to give it a shot.

As soon as you enter, you are assaulted visually with orange-red (well, I think that's what they are, underneath) walls, jam-packed with old signs, toys, and bumper stickers. Mind you, this is in a very small space. The tables are the old school laminate booths, decorated with some very 80's photos of teens. Lots of big hair!

Trying to be somewhat calorie conscious, we ordered two "mini" 5" subs and some drinks. Each also came with a rather sweet potato salad or something similar. 

My chicken sub was pretty dry and boring, and served on an equally dry and flavorless white roll. The only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper.

All in all, the food got a big *meh*. The decor was cool, but not worth eating the food. Oh, and if you decide to go, bring cash, rather than deal with their bizarre ATM system.I know it is  Denny's but still. Come on Denny you have competition for good cheap breakfasts nowadays. You used to have a reasonable priced, okay breakfast. What happened? I ate here on 6/4/13 and the coffee was cold, the eggs were ice cold and runny, the English Muffin was raw, not toasted at all and the fruit was actually spoiled. (brown bananas and sour, pruny, moldy grapes, WTH?) The bill was 10 dollars and change. OH MY! The server was nice but overworked. This is not the first time this location has had problems. We used to go here for our welcome back breakfast at school. It was bad. One time it took 1 hour to get my food and I got sick later on. YIKES.Huge place with comfortable seating.  That's all the positive things I can think to say about it.  My fiance stopped eating halfway through his plate for fear that he'd be sick if he continued.  I soldiered through, because I had been craving chinese buffet all day.  I took a sip of the hot and sour soup and could barely even recognize what I was tasting.  It was just WEIRD.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken weren't too bad, but just about everything else was too dried out (we were there at 6 so it should have been fresh), or was overloaded with large pieces of onion.  Someone got lazy with the chopping, I guess.  We didn't try the mongolian bbq.  Maybe that would have been okay, but we'll never know, because we won't be going back.uh..can u say "GHETTO" now if you're looking for shoes or jerseys this might be the spot for you as they have they have decent prices.  otherwise i probably wouldn't recommend spending your time here...unless ur  just looking for some AC.The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  

Okay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.

Once again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it?!?

The Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The "sour" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.

The egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  "My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!"  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  

The Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!

Service was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.

It pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he/she wishes this place was closer so he/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  

I rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.  In this case, I left food on the plate and almost shouted "no" too enthusiastically when I was asked if I needed a box to take the remainder home.  Oh God in Heaven:  NO!!!!!This had to be one of the worst experiences we've ever had at this location. The server Nikki was awful, the food was mediocre at best. Never will we sit in her area again!Dis place is closed.My husband and his Buddy played golf here today. They just over seeded, they should have informed them before they played. According to my husband they had just over seeded and it was like putting on Shag Carpet.  Also the Golf Carts were VERY Loud.  He wont be going back there any time soon!Went to Sam's Club last Sunday with my mom.  Baby C wears Sam's brand diapers.  They're cheaper and they're just as good as Pamper or Huggies.  Well, we've never had a problem at this Sam's Club ever...until this past weekend.  Granted it was busy.  People were waiting in line.  I got out of the bottleneck and told my mom to follow with the cart.  I head towards the east end of the checkout lanes and find a lane and stand in it..waving my mom over.  No sooner than I wave my mom over, this guy in the next lane completely looks past me and pushes his cart in front of me.  I tell him "Sir, I'm standing right here in line."  He says..No I've been here the whole time.  To which i state, No you've been lane hopping and I've been watching you for the last minute.  You were in the lane over.  He proceeds to get in my face cursing at me in Spanish.  I back down...because a lot of not nice things were going to start flying from my mouth..(which would have ended in me probably punching the guy in the face)...and I state...alright sir..you were standing here the whole time..Though everyone around here knows you're lying.  That's fine.  My mom walks over after the guy starts cursing at me and states..."You do not speak to my daughter that way!"  He then starts cursing her out in Spanish and says..I'll see you outside.  UHH..WTF!?  

The whole time this exchange was going on...No one from Sam's Club - a manager, floor sup, NO ONE comes over to intervene.  My mom sees a worker, who looks to be a manager or front end sup..and says...why are you just standing there witnessing this happen?!  He says...well he's a customer.  WELL EXCUSE THE FRACK OUT OF US!  I THOUGHT WE WERE FRACKING CUSTOMERS TOO!?  

My mom dials up the police and they're there in no time.  We weren't about to mess around with someone stating they'll "See us outside".  Police get there and the dude bails.  

I can only hope that a Sam's Club will open on my side of town.  That way I wont be subjected to verbal abuse from rude customers that is apparently okay with managers/sups at this ghetto Sam's Club.Terrible customer service, staff arguing with each other. Slow slow slow!!! 20 minutes to get 3 cheese burgers and a small fry. It wasn't that they were overly busy, there might have been 10 people total.this motel sucks!! never going to stay in thsi Arizona dumpe ever again.My two cabinets and couch that are vintage were ruined in storage.  This was made evident when the movers returned my office furniture.  The movers showed me the damage before it was moved from their storage pod.  Then, they offer me $90.00 to settle the matter and had an erroneous contract to try and minimize my claim.  I informed them that the furniture they damaged was vintage and literally irreplaceable.  I will never use them again and considering how I was treated after they made mistake after mistake, would never recommend them to anyone.Well....I got sucked in. I already dislike Domino's to begin with...But I have been seeing all those commercials where they are bagging on themselves and saying how the pizza is completely new and improved. 

Well that's a load of Horse $h!t. 

We ordered a pizza last night because I am a bad wife and haven't gone grocery shopping. I say to the hubs, hey lets give it a shot. He moans in disgust. I say, well they say its completely new and improved, lets just try it out. 

We ordered on line. That was really cool. You can follow your order in the shop while they are making it. We even knew our delivery drivers name before he got to our door because the update told us his name and that he just left. That's rad...I would give Domino's a 3 just on this alone! 

We ordered their new pizza with the special crust and then new fancy sauce. Kept it simple and just got pepperoni on it. We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things. 

The chicken kickers were tasty. I really liked the dipping sauce. 

The cheese bread was yummy as well! 

The new fan-dangled pizza....HOLY GROSS!!! Same old Domino's people... 

Do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial. 

The commercial should go more like: 
Hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks. 
So we changed it up and guess what PIZZA STILL SUCKS! 

Our cat that always begs for food didn't even come around asking for pizza. That's pretty bad, that cat will eat anything! In fact, from now on, any take out we get will have a Tuki (our cat) rating on it. 

Tuki gives this zero stars, as he didn't even want it near him.This had got to be the worst food and environment ever! The place was filthy, the food was gross. $11 for what? REALLY BAD FOOD! Never again. My little brother says "YUCK...poor doggy"...he says he is not kidding, he said it did not taste like anything he has ever had before.I'm writing this review mainly to say that this location is now CLOSED.

Which is quite sad, not to mention perplexing, why TJ's would close one of their best-stocked and busy TJ's in the valley. Not a good move, in my opinion to force West Phoenix customers to drive either out to Arrowhead, 20th st/Camelback, or various other locations in Tempe and Scottsdale.

Bad business decision, in my opinion.I ordered a Serta office chair at the store, was told the chair would be delivered in 1 to 3 business days.  I am now on day seven, and no one can tell me where the chair is or when it will be delivered.  In this day and  age of instant access to incredible amounts of information a company that is in the business of selling information related items, affiliates themselves with an organization that cant track their item, does not deserve your business.   Go somewhere else, for your office needs, or make sure you leave the store with your items.gross, smells filled with dirt and bugs, hookers hang out here, this is a gross hotel
do not stay here.This is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do. I don't know how else to put it. I have been twice because the humane society pays for a visit within five days of adoption. So of course I am going to use the vet visit. From the second I entered the exam room with the vet tech I felt like I was on a car lot and preparing for battle. It is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet. Which I expected, I have been to corporate vets before. So my cat had an upper respiratory thing that animals in shelters get and the vet put him on antibiotics (incidentally the cost of the antibiotics is about $8 more per bottle than at my small vet office in central phoenix) which is great so we rescheduled for a check up.

I should not have gone. First of all I got shamed and lectured for a few minutes because my cat was not in a carrier. I know this was my bad but seymour never once got out of my arms as I knew he wouldn't because he is a very calm cat. I really did not see the harm and the carrier makes him so anxious. I was compared to a parent who does not put their child in a car seat. awesome.

Next I meet with a new vet tech who tries to upsell me on every vaccine on the market which I politely declined. He then tells me my cat is too fat (yea I know that) and should be 12 lbs. Yea no that is the equivalent of telling a 5 ft 11 large bones woman to aim for 115 lbs. He's a big cat not just fat. So the vet comes in (a totally different vet than I saw last time)  and tells me her name then says wow that is a fat cat you need to get his weight under control or like all fat adults and animals he will likely get diabetes. I am also a fat person so I feel like the lecture was intentional and she did not see that I adopted this animal 2 weeks ago. I have also been to this rodeo a few times and I do not have or make my animals fat. We are on top of the weight loss plan. Unlike the tech because they don't seem to communicate well she tells me he should be 15lbs which is the difference of him losing 3lbs or 6 lbs. Quite a different for an animal under 20lbs! She then says oh his eyes are pretty though just got to work on the weight. What does that mean? Did my cat really get fat shamed? lol hilarious! Then she says oh good I can feel his bladder so he's not too fat for an exam. Really? stop talking about how fat you think he is and say something nice to him while you are molesting his internal organs.

I'll be going to my own vet thanks;)Awful and no service, the food is not good anymore, plus they give old and stale bread, dust and webs on the ceiling fans and no one cares.I usually love going to Mimi's, but had never been to this location before. I will never go there again. We had a party of 15 with a reservation so they knew we were coming. We waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got 4. We dealt with that and passed them around. That was the least of the issues. About 45 minutes after sitting down, our orders were taken. The bread baskets finally came. I waited about 20 minutes for a refill on my coffee and then went and got it myself. I also got extra napkins, which we had asked for, and refilled some water glasses for my group. Some of us ordered from the "Cafe Express" menu, because we thought that would be easy and quick. Not so! It took at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered until ALL of our party had their food. That is inexcusable! When the food came, some of it was wrong, but we didn't dare send it back for fear that we'd never get the right food returned. Some of us would have ordered dessert, but figured it would take too long to get it, since our waiter, Tony, kept on complaining about the number of tables he had to cover and how overworked he was.
 
On the "Cafe Express" menu, it states that if you don't get your food in 15 minutes, it will be free. Since they had WAY exceeded the time limit they themselves had set, I pointed that out. If it had only been 20 minutes, we would have let it go, but this was well past that. I was told that the 15 minute time limit  did not apply to large groups, though that is not stated anywhere. After some discussion, we were told the manager would adjust the bills, but it was because we insisted that they honor the commitment they made, not because they wanted to. I am not sure if the problem is in the kitchen or out on the floor, but it needs to be fixed.

I will still go to Mimi's, just not that location.I love the food...however service here is horrible. Outright Horrible.  I have been working in this area for the past 7 months and not 1 time out of 7 was eithe my order ready or complete/correct.
Yesterday I told a co-worker I would give them 1 last chance and place my order 1.5 hour in advance to the to go optin online. Guess what.....didn't get the right dressing, salad looked curly and old and there was no soup with my order.
 A manager had to come out to swipe his card to see my order and yet they didnt realize my order wasn't correct. I wanted to order online for convenience, as I have only a 30 minute break. drive out, pay, grab food and leave. No EVERYTIME my food still needs to get ready. 2 weeks ago my soup dropped on the floor, but the carry carton wasn't folded correctly, the time before that my soad was spilled all over my food, because of the same reason. They rush, rush and don't pay attention to their customers. Back in March I had 1 hour lunch, sat down with 2 co-worker, no one came up to us for 20 minutes, we left our table to order to go. it took them an other 10 minutes to notice us. A'manager' came rushing by to apologize ' to be oh so sorry, here have some free muffins' and left. 15 minutes later, they didnt know how to swipe our cards, but the 'manager' kept looking in our direction, but didn't take any actions, I guess muffins do for any mess up.
When I filled out the online questionaire for free muffins and I gave them 1's, it disconnected me and no code. I will not recommend them to any of my friends. I will NOT go bacck here for my lunch.  1 mess up can be forgiven, but 6 out of 7 (!!!) NO, NO. I am done.  I heard Jason's deli across the street has great salads.......Terrible service (waited 30 Minutes at 11pm on a Thursday night) just to see a waitress. Beer was a great value. But bartender was upset when I told her that I needed to see a waitress (after 30 minutes of waiting). Even with the great beer price, I will not go back. Also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise.First and last time in this shop. Bad customer service. If you didn't pay 2K for your bike  they will snub you. Bad business.I used to like coming here for UFC...

The service has always been a bit questionable, but the food was decent enough to make up for it and best of all, no cover charge. 

I came for lunch a month or so ago with coworkers and discovered the new menu. No more sweet potato fries, no more jalapeno bottle caps, no more cheese curds? Say it ain't so! Also, all new servers, and the bathrooms somehow have gotten even more disgusting. Functioning locks on the doors would be nice.

Tonight was the last straw. A waitress or manager, and then a child (yes, really) kept coming on over the speaker to announce the drink special. We'd been there since 5pm, and so had just about everyone else. The final time was DURING the lightweight title fight, mid-round. 

I don't care if I have to pay a cover to go somewhere else. I'd like a wait staff that will notice garbage on the table from the previous customers and CLEAN IT OFF WITHOUT ME ASKING! C'mon! I'm not sure if most of the changes are due to a new owner or manager, but the servers need to be trained, and the overhead pages to announce drink specials need to stop. It's loud and annoying. Also, screwdrivers as a special on Saturdays is maybe appropriate in the morning, but how about long islands or rum and coke later on? I'm not going to drink a screwdriver with hot wings and pizza on a Saturday night.My wife and I always heard good things about this place.  We were wanting to go to Tagliani's, but thought we should try Native New Yorker for once, to see what the hype was about.  We were sat quickly and the lady seemed pretty nice.  Unfortunately she rushed us through our decisions and never offered any helpful options or features/benefits.  Happy hour lists appetizers being half off, but that's only some of them, and conveniently, the three I was considering were those.  I understand there are small prints on deals at times so that could easily be overlooked.  

The buffalo chicken dip appetizer we ordered was really good, but only worth $4 maybe $5 size-wise and could have been a lot better without the chunks of chicken.  

My wife ordered the veggie calzone with pepperoncinis and mushrooms.  When this came out we were both impressed with the size, but the bread didn't have much flavor.  Along with this, recotta cheese was a very "strange" cheese to include being that its so grainy and overpowering.  It ruined the calzone for me altogether.  

I ordered 18 wings on the bone.  6 suicide, 6 hot, and 6 pineapple teriyaki.  The wings had a good amount of chicken, more than any other restaurant, but the sauces ruined it for me again.  I can handle a lot of heat so my opinion may differ from others.  The suicide sauce wasn't very hot, but there were so many red pepper seeds everywhere and they were actually pretty gross, unless doused in ranch.  I felt they tried so hard to make them hot, they ignored the taste factor altogether.  The hot wings were very good and decently spicy.  The pineapple teriyaki wings were ok, but seemed almost soggy because of possibly soaking the wings in the sauce for hours, absolutely doused.  I'm not sure which wings caused it, and I NEVER get heartburn, but I did here.  

While we were waiting for the bill, we realized our server was the only serving the entire restaurant.  I understand this isn't her fault, but the restaurants.  The bill finally came, she had overcharged us for the calzone.  All minimal things that could be overlooked, but so many that it ruined the entire experience.  

With waters and those meals the total was $30.20.  I tipped $5 and got the hell out of there.  Should have gone to Tagliani's.  I took the extra food home, not to waste, but it just sat there in fear of heartburn again.

If you go for drink and wings, I imagine it could be somewhat of an enjoyable scene being the bar top tables are all close and near the bar and there are tv's everywhere.  

I would have given 2 stars, but my stomach hurts now.YIKES!  There is no way this place deserves five stars!  The pizza was so bad I had to go to Fry's to get something else for lunch... but then again, I guess at $4 for two slices and a drink, you get what you pay for.
'Homey' is not a word I would use to describe this place.  The family of aggressively accented men who run the place are probably the most interesting thing about it... but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it.  I am definitely not coming back.  Just gross.Is everyone else reviewing this place in cahoots with them or what?

I consider myself to be somewhat of a Chinese food connoisseur, so I am always excited to try a new spot. I was staying with a friend in this area, so I ordered from Abacus. First off, I found them to be a tad expensive. I ordered pork fried rice, chicken fried rice, crab puffs and chicken egg foo young with lo mein instead of white rice and it was $40.00!

The rice was bland and the pork was an odd color. The chicken fried rice was also bland. 

The crab puffs were 99.9% warm cream cheese with the tiniest sprinkling of crab essence.... 

Our disgust was in the chicken egg foo young and lo mein. The lo mein came in an individual carton and was just dried noodles. There are no veggies mixed in nor any meat. The egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce. I've ordered this same dish from every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in and NEVER has it looked like this. We sent out a search party to locate the egg, the foo or the young but were unsuccessful, so we contacted the delivery company thinking they got the order wrong. After a half hour we received a call to inform us that that was INDEED the chicken egg foo young and that they don't mix the meat into the egg; they just pour it on top. Since I already had it and was unhappy by the presentation, I figured... why not try it and complete the cycle of unhappiness. The taste did not disappoint in that area. Three tiny egg patties sat underneath all of the water chestnuts, thin liquid, chicken, broccoli, and every other vegetable they could throw into this container....


THE BEST THING I ATE WAS THE FORTUNE COOKIE.... I'll never order from them again!Tiffany never brought my water. I asked seven times.

I was only here for karaoke.This pet store was closed long ago. Needs to be removed.Worst salon ever. Worst customer service. Worst dye job. I had stains and the color bled everywhere. My neighbor was nice enough to fix it for me by dying my hair back to a color close to my natural one. When the stylist (if you can call her that) was putting my color on me she left in the middle to mix more color and left me there for 30 minutes. Half of my head was over processed. I noticed she was also using Safeway Brand aluminum foil (for food not hair. not impressive.). While I sat there processing she went over to where the other stylists were congregating doing their own hair, talking crap about customers, and texting on their phones (not a pretty sight). I will not be going back. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.Not only rude but seriously, the slowest service ever!!!!!!Wish i could give no stars. Management is unprofessional, unsanitary, and rude.  Order a sandwich took a bite, order was wrong took food back spoke to manager Ana. Most disgusting health code violation. She took my sandwich which i had already bitten. Told staff open my sandwich put correct ingredients in, gave back bitten sandwich and began preparing other orders without switching gloves. Huge health code violation. DISGUSTING. Who knows how many orders she tainted with such disgusting habits. Poor Management all around.This place is good for about an hour of entertainment, on a good day.  The hi light was paper airplane making, something we can easily do at home.  My suggestion, spend the $4 more and head to the Children's Museum downtown.  It is better by leaps and bounds.If I could give it zero stars I would!  This isn't the friendliest place in town.  Sure, it was close to our house but never again will I set foot in this nasty place.  Our first interaction with the owner was him making fun of Americans, that was why they have the "diner special" posted all over the restaurant.   I felt very uncomfortable the second I walked in there.  It felt as if he just saw dollar signs when he would glance at my wife and I.  


On to the food.... Horrible, just horrible, I ordered the Shrimp Lo-mein.  To my surprise the food came out really quick!  The second he put the plate of hot mess in front of my face the smell almost started my gag reflex. Now I knew why it had come so fast.  The mixture of noodle, canned mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, bamboo shoots and whatever else they had thrown in the mix with the shrimp all had burn marks on them.  It looked like they had only stirred the mixture only once, then let the one side just sit in the pan until they smelt it burn, ding, the timer was done.

 The smell of burnt food actually ended up being the taste of the whole meal!  Now, I am one who will have the waiter take back the plate of food if it is not up to eatable standards but in this case I didn't want to have to fight with this guy about how horrible this plate of crap was.  I nibbled on what looked eatable then we quickly packed our left overs, paid and left, the closes garbage can we found we threw the food away.

I'm not quite sure why or if we ordered the right thing but I can't figure out why this place is getting highish reviews on Yelp.  How this place is still open in that matter.  I say turn around and run from this place.  Go try a different hole in the wall.I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and "Small Business Saturday" I thought "why not give them another try", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said "Oh, I have another one in the box" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said "NOT cool at all" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  

I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  

I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.Do you know why there are zero stars checked?  BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS NOT OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS

My life plan:  "vacation" studying at new and exciting coffee shops and bars with the BDF (best drink friend, which is not the same as bast food friend) while we work on the weekends.  Two times I tried to go her, and two times I was denied.  I thought the closure was temporary the first time I went.  It was Historic Homes tour day... so I thought the private event was the reason it was closed on a saturday.  But this weekend, low and behold.... I still could not go!  Closed!  Every weekend!  No people in the old town componenet of Mesa -- which it too bad because it has a kickass yarn store and tons of potential.

Will add stars if my impending weekday visit really knowcks my socks off.  A penalty for th no weekend service will remain.One star but not based on their food or coffee, but on their service.

Both the website and the sign on the gate said they were to be open Sundays 8am to 3pm but it should say "or whatever we feel like". It was not open and there was no sign explaining why. A simple "closed for private party" sign would have been fine but nothing was there. I went out of my way to come to this shop, making sure before online it was open Sundays. They should note on their website that the hours are tentative and to call ahead, as a warning. This is no way to run a business.I stopped by @  Diamond's Sports Grill aka Sluggo's Sports Grill to try out a new place with friends and ordered a sourdough burger with fries.   Well...  I just google image searched "sourdough burger" and yep - what I had last night did not look like ANYTHING on the first 18 results.  

I know, sounds ridiculous but hey, I just wanted to double check because what I ate last night was ridiculously greasy to the point that the bread was soaked, the bread was barely toasted, the shape of the bread was entirely different to the shape of the burger and it brought back memories of eating short hot dogs with long hot dog buns back in the day when I was in college.  I appreciated the pleasant memories from college but now that I'm 31, I'd like to have food that's a bit better in quality.  The fries were unremarkable.

So food aside, I was paying the bill and the server did the one thing I absolutely abhor when I go out to eat.  For a $15.xx bill, I gave her a $20 and she asked me if I needed change.

Now ok.  I'm not going to be living in the streets over $4.xx but at the same time, I find it very annoying when someone asks for a 30% tip when the service was poor.

Don't go unless every place, and I really mean EVERY PLACE IN THE AREA THAT SELLS ANYTHING EDIBLE, is closed or you love curt service and bad food.

To be fair, the place wasn't all bad news bears, I got to meet up with my friends!  :)George was robbed of two pieces of currency in September 2013.. A scottsdale coin dealer helped recover his possessions that were stolen Kudos to that dealer in North Scottsdale.......... a  guy risking physical harm...... and danger..... I wonder if this George guy ever thanked him or gave him a token of appreciation..... if he did't shame on George......
Frank MillerSkip and goto Osha Thai opposite. We gave up a great meal to try this place. Knew there was trouble when there was dried food on the silver wear and last nights grease stains on the cloth napkins. I kept my mouth shut, the server had attitude at 'hello'. We left 3/4 of our food on the plate, it was bad, reluctantly had to open my mouth and tell the server food wasn't great, he replied with major attitude, 'oh thats funny, everyone loves our food' and then glides off. It was that blunt. Came back with bill. We highlighted the fact he didn't ask what was wrong and major attitude sprung again. Asked for the manager, he sprung major attitude again, manager came out, I felt for the guy, he did his best, some servers need new careers seriously or just need to jump off a cliff. 
Gave us half off the bill, we weren't looking for $ off, just to give our experience and really let them know. How many customers leave saying to themselves 'that was terrible' and they never know. I'm tired of spending my money on poor food and expected tips on rude servers. One positive.....Beer was coldCalled and made an appointment to get my tire repaired.  When I went there, the receptionist/salesman went outside to look at my tire which had a slow leak and was not fully inflated.  He then said they could not repair it because it was too worn and was dangerous.  He then went into a hard sales pitch about getting a new tire.  My car has less than 25,000 miles. Obviously, if a tire is not fully inflated, the tread will look shallower.  Waste of time, will never go back there or any discount tire again.  I really like how they take you outside so they can lay the sales pitch on outside of the other customers earshot.  Also, I can't be 100% sure but I think he put in a nail while I wasn't looking (it was magically in my direct line of view and was glinting in the sun and looked very clean) .  Stay away from these crooks!  They didn't even bother to try filling my tire with air.  Good thing I have my own inflator.I was a patient of Dr Pease's office for about 18 months.  Due to recent experiences, I've decided to search for a dentist to replace Dr. Pease.

In the time I was a patient, Dr Pease was never in the office when i was there for my appointments, so I never met him. His assistants are nice enough.  My frustration comes from their availability and lack of follow-through.

What they don't tell you is when summer hits, their entire office seems to take most of the season off since most of their clients are snowbirds, making it difficult for an actual citizen of AZ like myself to schedule appointments.  For my most recent appointment, I arrived at their office at my scheduled time, only to find the door locked!

Turns out they had allegedly tried calling me to re-schedule because Dr Pease would once again be out of the office. They then re-scheduled me for another day without telling me.  All of this as a follow up to a cavity that I may or may not have because they did not take proper x-rays.

If you're a snowbird, I'm sure his office will work fine for you.  But I'm moving on.Where do I even begin. The restroom was disgusting smelled like urine, out of toilet paper AND paper towels. Extremely slow and half ass pedicure. When I asked for paraffin I was told no it takes 2 hours to heat up (you would think they would handle that when opening the salon in the morning) and offered salt scrub instead, which I declined since it gives my sensitive skin a razor burn effect. 
NOT KID FRIENDLY. My 6 year old likes to get her toes done with mommy, and was yelled at for trying to turn on the massage chair "That not a toy!!" And after my toes were done I was moved to an uncomfortable chair to sit with a tiny little fan blowing cold air on my feet for 30 minutes!! I could go on but this pretty much covers the basics. I am normally a 20% tipper and for the first time I left no tip. We will most definitely not be back. As inexpensive as this place is I left feeling over charged and unsatisfied. I could have soaked my feet in cool water rubbed lotion on them and painted my toes at home for free and not felt unwelcome.Here's a dissss-gusting one for you.  Picture this.... 1993, Highschool, floating down the Salt River with a light buzz (who doesn't drink on the river?  Even 7 year olds are plastered) and my friend asks me what happend to my leg?  Why the bandaid?  I thought that was strange... nothing happened to my leg, I didn't have on a bandaid.  But I did.... it wasn't mine, it must have been in the water and it stuck to side of my leg with my ass firmly planted in the tube and my gams dangling in the water.  UGHHHHHH... I almost threw up, but instead I drank another warm keystone light and made it all better. 

Never again.Make no mistake, this is a booze cruise and is not family friendly.  We had observed the booze cruise of tubes from one of the recreation areas along the Salt River, but still wanted to give it a try as my daughter was finally old enough to go.  We thought that father's day might be a little tamer than the usual outing.  Who knows, it might have been.  Everyone brings marshmallows and litters them throughout the river.  One group had marshmallows the size of bricks.  I had to pick up one to figure out what it was.  Drunk people will also shot their water guns at you for fun, even if you have a small child.  Probably because they are drunk.  Some children through some water balloons at my wife.  When she confronted them, the father asked her what she was going to do about it.  This is a good representation of the type of people on the river.  I can see how this would be fun for social drinks, with or without kids, I suppose.  Bring your alcohol, and when you're done with a can, throw it into the river.  The bottom is lined with cans.  No glass is allowed.  It is also expensive for tubing compared to other tubing trips I've been on.  But guess what folks, that's how a monopoly operates.  High prices and poor customer service.so, as an auto owner, i've had nothing but good experiences with AAA, from Georgia to NM to California to Mass, and back home to AZ, never a problem. 

it's the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding. way back when, we looked into destination weddings with a AAA AZ branch. our rep always said "i'm looking into it, i'll call you tomorrow" and then a week later, i'd call to ask what the hold up was and was met by the same thing. a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired. 

so we've got plenty of time and decide to go to a different AAA AZ branch, the one on Glendale Ave. We were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle EVERYTHING to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember. said she did the same trip (although not for a wedding) for a group of friends every year, so she "knew what she was doing". things went sour from there. 

we hardly EVER received return phone calls on time. all the guests we invited that were to book through this AAA branch never received phone calls back. so every-single-one of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 1-2 guests, all of them. and when we pressed her about this, it was always "oh, my system crashed" or "oh, my phone wasn't working"....come on!

fast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon. still no word from the AAA rep. Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation. you want to see stressed? how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?

but the proverbial icing on the cake? we were advised to have our invitees "donate" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website. that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check. 

unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. at no point were we informed that 10% of "donations" would be kept by AAA. furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding "donation" check. it was always "they're cutting the check today"...a week later...."they're cutting the check today", etc. 

to summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only. their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with. we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.how is this place in business?  the only thing good I can say about it is it was soo bad it made us leave and we found an amazing place!  no names mentioned, but you can read my reviews.

service was non-existant and the place was not well kept at all.  We left after one short drink.  Too much wrong to list...just skip this one.My boyfriend and I visited this property and really liked the price for what seemed like quality. We put down a holding deposit on an apartment, pending approval. The document/receipt for the deposit stated that we had 48 hours to get the deposit back if we changed our minds, but that the deposit was refundable if we were not approved for the apartment. My credit was not approved, so they told us we were denied.  I asked if a co-signer would change things; they said no. I asked if we could get the apartment if my boyfriend was approved on his own. The manager said yes.  She made it clear that because I wouldn't be on the lease I would not be able to personally request help from maintenance and if I got locked out of the apartment they wouldn't be able to give me a key because my name would not be on the lease.  He got approved and we were excited to move in. Two weeks later, which was 2 weeks before our planned move-in date- my boyfriend got a call that management had changed and he was no longer approved for the apartment and both residents (he and I) had to be individually approved.  They said we could re-apply in six months. They were incredibly rude and had trouble explaining their reasoning for everything and they were constantly placing blame on other employees. All we wanted was for them to be honest with us, and they were dishonest and changing their stories repeatedly.  We had had enough and decided we'd rather not deal with such terrible, incompetent management.  After all that, since they said we were not approved, we asked to be refunded our holding deposit and they refused. The "Deposit to Hold Agreement" states exactly, "The holding deposit is refundable if my application is not approved payable to the party(s) completing this application." The woman kept insisting we were cancelling and that we only had two days to cancel and get a refund.  If we were not permitted to get our holding deposit back, then we should have been approved to move into the apartment- but we were not. Therefore, the holding deposit should rightfully be refunded.DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! They took two days to "fix" a problem for me. I got my car back and the issue was not resolved. I also have a new issue now. Now it having trouble starting. :( I wish i could give negative stars.Not customer oriented. No real leadership, there's like no manager to speak to here. Hopefully this place goes out of business machines here are old and hard to use.I've been to plenty of jamba juice locations before. But my experience at this particular store was just terrible.
I came here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 2... Store was fairly empty with maybe 1 person in front of Me and 2 behind me in line. 
 
I thought I'd be in and out in a few minutes as I just b ordered one smoothie, no extras, nothing special. 
But no... I was left waiting in the store for almost half an hour. 
I would have said forget it and just return my money but no one would come to the counter! 

 Someone behind me was served before me, and the woman in front of me was served after me! Also, after they finally finished my smoothie, they left the cup near the hot oven where they were cooking something. I tried to tell them that was my smoothie but they ignored me and let it melt, then 5 Minutes later moved my smoothie to the counter where they didn't even call my name. I took a sip and some of it was warm, except the chunks. Of powder that weren't blended! 


Also it's funny to me that the other bad review on this location was pushed into the "not recommended" area.If I could give this place negatives stars I would. The services they provide are pathetic. I've went her MANY times because it is closely located to my home. It has failed to impress me on each occasion. The multiple times I've had my eye brows done I was left looking like a clown. Don't get me wrong she did a wonderful job shaping them just how I grow them however I'm not sure what she did with the wax. I was sore for days. Speaking of pain, the time I had my acrylics done. The false nails were placed inappropriately making 3 of my nails face a different direction. When having them removed....SHE RIPPED THEM OFF. Im not kidding! She put another fake nail under to lift them up slightly, then ripped them off. After the third one, I asked her to stop. It started bleeding because she ripped my real nails off. Then she poured alcohol straight on them to sterilize it. I was SO angry! She could have given me a warning. From there she had to super glue my real nail to my skin so it would stay down. Just pathetic right? 

Now that Ive discovered threading, I will never have my eyebrows waxed again. 

And as far as nails...I will be doing my own until I find a salon that meets my expectations!FYI Suzanne's Bridal Boutique in Gilbert is by far the absolute worst place I have ever stepped foot in! Yes the dresses are pretty but seriously their service is worse than horrible!!! They have terrible customer service. They are by far the rudest people I have ever met. The charge hundreds of dollars more for dresses that you can buy online for next to nothing. ANNNDDDDDD they have the worst alterations, they truly are pathetic! The faberic was coming apart and had to get them to fix it, but worst of all was the corset they put in this dress was off by a half an inch on one side. Their way of explaining it was "oh you just pull it tighter" REALLY?!? Seriously save yourself the time, money, and frustration GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE! Shopping for your wedding dress is supposed to be a happy time not a time where you are to be treated with 0 respect.Stopped by to look, --not impressed at all--. 
Very poor lighting, dirty dressing rooms, VERY high prices. Small things like accessories are marked up way over retail(dresses seemed pretty outrageous too)!!
I am not plus sized but I'm also not a size 2. If you are over a size 10 in bridal (which is a size 8 in street clothing), there will be no dresses for you to try on here. There was 1 dress I was able to try. It was very expensive for not much dress and the alterations were very very pricey compared to other stores!!
Sales girls at the desk are not only RUDE and SNOTTY but also seem confused on how to ring you out for a simple trinket, EVEN WHEN PAYING CASH. 
I would not be at all comfortable with trusting my big day to these people.Smelled like pee, had tweekers standing outside looking like they couldn't wait to break into your car the minute you walked inside & no one noticed us or seated us so we left. Won't go back there ever again.Eww. Just eww. Based on the previous Yelp reviews I was expecting mediocre, at best. However the food at this place was just gross. Add that to the horrible service- we wont be back. 

There was 4 of us in our party, we were seated right away. I ordered iced tea to drink and it was so gross- clearly old and had gone bad. It was all downhill from there. Our four orders were taken correctly but 3/4 orders came out after about 45 mins. The 4th order took almost an entire hour to come to the table. Now, to be fair- if the restaurant was busy or the food was amazingly good- Im okay with the wait. However, the restaurant was not busy at all- and yes, the other reviews are correct- it looks like heaven's waiting room in there. Apparently the elderly like gross food. The servers brought out items and placed each plate, without any communication, at the center of the table. So, we were left guessing what items belonged to which order. There was never a refill on drinks, never a check back to the table to see if we liked the food, nothing. The only time we saw our server again was when she tossed the check on the table and walked away.the pizza was great for awhile, then the pizza started to taste like those big permanent markers. i guess it was the ink from the cardboard, got it 2 times, told the manager, he said no one else complained about it?  have to say it's the last time i go thereWORST nail salon experience ever! It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I went in for a manicure with my sister and we both experienced absolutely terrible customer service. Half way into taking off my nail polish, the lady who was doing my nails started going through her texts and opened up a picture of 2 puppies...she then proceeded to ask the other customers around me which one they liked the best because she was planning on purchasing one. So there I am, sitting with half of my nails unpolished, and if that wasn't enough, she decided to call the owner of the puppies to try to get more information on them.  I was completely dumbfounded...I looked over at my sister who had a male working on her nails...he thought it was appropriate to tell racist jokes about blondes and Mexicans, which happened to be the only races of women in the salon. 
His jokes: "What do you call a smart blonde?...A golden retriever." 
"Why did the Mexican go to Chinatown to get coffee?...To "capp-a-ccino""
My sister and I were so fed up that we decided to walk out mid manicure. I strongly suggest skipping out on this salon.Very bad food!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! 

We have been driving by this place for years and finally decided to try it out. It was bluntly a WASTE of a date night. We arrived at 7:30pm, and after four different wait staff simply looked at us and kept going about whatever they were doing we decided to leave. As soon as we opened the door we were told a table was ready but the busboy. We should have kept walking out the door, but unfortunately decided to give the place a try even though we were never greeted. 

Once we were seated the waitress took our drink and appetizer order. The coffee was horrible, and the ice tea was flavorless even with lemon. The salad bar was pathetic and the soup was mediocre at best. We placed our order within ten minutes of being seated. Thirty minutes later the waitress came by to ask if we would like dessert. We hadn't even received our dinner yet and she was asking if we wanted dessert!! I told her this, and 15 minutes later we received our plates. By this time our frustration level with the experience was quite high, and we immediately asked for carry-out containers. 

The potatoes from dinner taste like boxed potatoes and not seasoned well. I ordered something with rolled beef with carrots and pickle in it. It could have tasted good if the meat wasn't dried out. 

I'm 3/4 German but didn't grow up eating German food, so it this is an Authentic German eating experience I am forever thankful for my American food upbringing.

This was an unpleasant experience on every level, although I will say our server was nice even if the service wasn't. The $55 bill was definitely a cruel joke for such tasteless, and crappy experience.After reading all the reviews I am wondering if we were in the same place. Usually when I go to a restaurant I can say the food tastes (good or bad), but going tonight we had food that had no taste. My boys had the brats and they tasted like water, no spices AT ALL! While the cabbage was good ( and also the service), I think the gravy, rye bread and cheese were bought off the rack from across the street....nothing German about it! 

Considering that two adults and two young boys had dinner and drinks ( soda and two very small beers) we had a $50 bill. It is not enough any more to just put out tasteless food, even if it was an off night.Restaurant only....we stopped in tonight and were not impressed.
5 Year old specifically ordered a hamburger, ketchup and cheese only. It came with all the fixins and we had to pick them off. He does not like pickles and did not like the juice on his bun. The bun was huge and it was hard. The cheese that he wanted stuck to the lettuce. The fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. 
Hubby ordered a pasta dish with Seafood. He ate half and then the waitress was helping the couple at next table - the woman wanted to know about the seafood dish so the waitress asked if he liked it. His reply, "it was okay". When asked if he would order it again, he said, no, it was not that good.
Me, I ordered the Taco Salad. Took one bite and the meat-bean mixture was cold. I sent it back and it looked like it came out new (I had stirred it up), again, the meat-bean mixture was cold - I had two bites. It was tasted like lard since it wasn't warmed to the right temp. Ordered a slice of pie and mentioned to the waitress that the taco salad was cold which, it why I didn't eat it. She was going to comp the $1.00 pie. 
I mentioned at the register that I did not eat the Taco Salad and asked for it to be removed and I would pay for my pie. He offered to remove $5. That left me paying $3.99 for a Taco Salad that I did not eat. I told him that was fine but I would not be back. He said, sorry to hear that.  The couple sitting next to me did not receive the correct steak. The cook made a rib-eye instead of a strip or something to that effect. In short, the cook made an error on their order. Reading other reviews. It sounds like they need a new cook in the kitchen.
I would give the waitresses more stars, they are really hard trying to make up for lack of help in the kitchen. They were fun and joked with my son before the meal arrived. 

I recommend the butcher shop, we have been a customer for years. Their meat is good and I love their twice bake potatoes. Buy a steak and cook it at home. Skip the restaurant.This restaurant came highly recommended so I was eager to check it out. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. 

First, the portion sizes are incredibly large, which you'd think would be great. However, they're SO large that it begs the question of how on earth they're able to afford to give out these portions for a relatively cheap price? We're talking fresh, raw fish, not American-style buffet. Bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to sushi. 

The albacore was pretty tasty, I'll give it that. However, the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls!

Hot rice is disgusting!!!!!! So, so, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gross and a huge turn off!!! It warms the fish to the point of it not tasting right. Also if you don't eat the rolls immediately, the entire thing changes its consistency because the hot rice is melding with the cold fish and other vegetables. There is nothing more disappointing and disgusting than unknowingly biting into a warmed piece of sushi with hot rice. 

They also only had 2 sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant. The rolls came out sloppier than I'd make at home. The rice to fish ratio was totally off. There was so much fish in the rolls and so little rice you couldn't even fit the whole thing in your mouth. The rolls were literally falling apart from the moment the chef cut into them, mainly from the lack of tightness when being rolled. It looked like a total mess.

Sushi is just as much about the beautiful presentation and the flavor of the rice, as it is about the taste of the fish. Unfortunately this place had mediocre fish and horrible presentation...and hot rice, which tells me they're not willing to take the time (or care about their customers enough) to present fish properly.Regarding UHaul's "Family of Companies," poor customer service, illegal policies, rudeness, and inability to understand the definition of words used on their own contacts:

I ordered a U-Box from UHaul and picked it up (and returned it for shipping) on 6/12. As per their confirmation email to me, it was GUARANTEED to arrive at it's final destination 6/22. It did not arrive until 6/26. I was informed by a local UBox representative that it would be no problem to get the UBox sent to a slightly more convenient location. I kept in touch with her for several days and she then told me she had tried to speak to the shipping department.The shipping department had told her there was no way to change the destination without calling the (undisclosed to me) third party shipping company. Then they told her they couldn't do that as they didn't have a working telephone number for the shipping company!!!!

Every call I have made to UHaul, be it a specific location, regional office, or corporate headquarters has been handed off when I ask about getting a partial refund. Every person directs me to call another office. When I was finally able to get in touch with the originating Madison, WI office, the person I spoke with (supposedly the shipping manager- Brandon Fiddler) was incredibly rude to me as said flat out "I see it was shipped late. That's how it goes. I'm not giving you anything." I called corporate, after speaking to this man, I was told that I apparently threatened legal action so they won't speak to me any longer and have closed my case? Seeing as how I never threatened legal action, I find this preposterous, and I challenge them to produce the recording I did so in, since they record all phone conversations. UHaul has taken moving, an already stressful experience, and made it completely miserable. I have spent more than 7 hours on the phone with them, and can't get any resolution at all, and generally, receive nothing but insolence. They love to tell you that you have to contact the originating office or the receiving office or corporate or that the people you need to speak to are all away at the moment and have wildly unpredictable hours.

In addition to all of this, I had initially rented a trailer as well, and had a hitch installed on my car. The day comes to go get my trailer and they (surprise) don't have it. They make me drive out to the middle of friggin' nowhere to get it, 5 minutes before this gas station that does UHaul on the side is closing. We do the paperwork and he's ready to connect my trailer- except the hitch is incomplete! I had to run around this tiny town trying to find the remaining parts and lucky for me this nice guy stayed late. What a complete nightmare.

Update: A very nice guy at the original location approved roughly 30% of my expenses/ demand for money back. But that only happened AFTER I filed a complaint with the BBB, which is still going back and forth. FILE A COMPLAINT WITH BBB ASAP, that is likely the ONLY way they will even pay attention to you. Also, do some googling on it, their customer service isn't the only thing they like to pass blame from office to office on. If you sue them, you have to sue the corporate office in Phoenix. They will say it's a family of franchise companies and pass the blame, but that's how the actual law behind it works, and they will lose.

Oh- in addition, in the process of researching, I found this guy's story, READ IT.

I encourage you ALL to file small claims against one of the WORST companies I have literally ever dealt with in my life (and that includes Charter)!We decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15% off for first delivery....perfect , so i ordered on line with a  delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him know....perferct, so came the delivery time...plus 10 minutes........plus 10 more minutes.......plus 10 more minutes......so i called back to find out where the order was....she said   oh were sorry we thought it was for pick up....WHAT THE HELL so i can't tell you how the food is BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT ANY. ended up going else where. A return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice.DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! I am still absolutely horrified by the customer service we received today. Our spa broke the other night (of course when we were actually going to use it), so we called our home warrenty who apparently are contracted with Foster's. I read some negative and positive reviews on Kudzu, but of course, we are at the mercy of our home warrenty.

The technician came to our house today to do a diagnostic on it, and after a while with him outside, we received a call from our home warranty telling us that the technician called them and said he was unfamiliar with our type of spa and would not be able to fix it. First of all, the spa and control panel are by two different companies so we have no clue what which company  he was unfamiliar with. Second, and most shocking, we went outside to talk to him and HE WAS GONE! He just left without even speaking to us. In all fairness, we called the company to complain and they offered to send someone else out. Thankfully our warranty is sending a different company to us.Horrid! The girl at the drive thru told me it was 60 cents for ranch and I was purchasing 3 chicken nugget combos with fries... Are you reaaaaally that cheap mcdonalds?! NEVER AGAIN I have
Never heard of a fast food chain charging for all of your ranches, fuck you mcdonalds you stingy a$$ FUCKERS truly fuck youUp until tonight we ate here weekly. No more! Service was poor, did not EVER bring my wife's salad and my baked potato was only partially cooked. They took a whole two bucks off the bill, never brought the salad, and the server never apologized for not bringing the salad. Maybe 1 star was too high a rating come to think of it.Will NEVER deal with Home Depot again. Got what I thought was a great deal on a dishwasher but actually GETTING it was another matter.  First scheduled delivery, did not get promised call day before with delivery window nor did I get 30 minutes before delivery call.  When I finally called, I was told they didn't have any and I would have to reschedule. SAME story for second delivery - did not get day before call, and after waiting on delivery day I finally (again) called the store - only to be told it would not be delivered that day. I finally told them to cancel my entire transaction, canceled my credit card and now have to go find a dishwasher.  Note, HD's story is always that "it's a third party deliverer" - that is not my problem, they represent HD to me and this is my first and last experience with the company. GO LOCAL!Terrible service, seated a couple that came in 10 minutes after us first, let other people supposedly seat themselves!  Worker's yelling at each other, dirty!Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore.Andrea had a horrible attitude from the start. Every flower suggestion was turned down and the push towards roses was HUGELY obvious. Their "contract" was a piece of paper that said I would owe $___ amount by a specified date with no promise of services. When I questioned the lack of verbiage promising services/product in exchange for my money, Andrea became enraged that I "didn't trust them" and threw me out of her office. Don't be swayed by cheap prices, their service was junk and Andrea's lack of social skills reeked throughout the meeting. Contracts protect the consumer AND the vendor-run from these people!Tired fish, old rice, and terrible service ( my order came 1/2 hour after my dining companions), and when it finally arrived it was missing one of the items I ordered. Some other people in our party left due, they said, to the smell of the place. I can't deny the place DID have an odor.  Waited 45 minutes for the check,. Worst yet, I had terrible diarrhea the next day.  DON'T GO THERE! Your bowels and plumbing will thank you. PS - my understanding is that this restaurant is under new ownership. They better get their act together ASAP.The food is good but the services sucks!!  We had a young skinny asian server with glasses 3 times in a row. All three times was bad. He serves us like he hates his job. Everytime I order more food or water he gets mad at us. 
We came in on a Saturday  night at 9:45 and the restaurant closes at 10:30 but the asian server looked at the clock and told us that they were closed. I looked around and there were still customers.
We are done!! Were not coming back here again!!I was really excited to start classes at CGCC, but the staff completely turned me off to the school. They are beyond unhelpful! They gave me the run around for weeks. Denied me financial aid, even though FAFSA approved me for 2 grants. It's been a complete nightmare trying to get enrolled and set up for school... I will definitely be going elsewhere. They are NOT friendly, or helpful. I can't say enough negative things about CGCC. I'm not a fan.Absolute garbage we went to grab a quick dinner the other night. I ended up with food poisoning and missed work and vacation. I will never return to this location again!First warning would be that any rest that is completely empty at 7:30pm on a Thursday means the food is not good. The service was great but the food was a miss. I paid $19 for the 'short ribs' which actually was 4 tiny slices of overcooked meat. The rest of my party's dinner seemed average at best. The biggest problem is that my credit card was charged twice....I spoke with Eric the manager once after it happened but to date no credit back. I would have been willing to pay for the meal but I don't want to pay for that now either. I guess they need to get $ however they can.I ordered food for pick up..  I was told the total was $16 and came to pick up my food and had to pay $24, I argued  and should have just left.  I payed the 24 buck and could hardly eat it is was dry and disgusting.  I am sorry to have given them the chance they never deserved.This place is a stink hole! I havent been to this place in years and now I remeber why!! the decor is crap and dirty, i hesitated to even order food afraid of what it like when they prepare the food YUCK!!! I had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon so thats the only reason i went .
 Sausage burrito was salty, potatoes was old (extra .60) and it looks like generic yellow cheese( extra .50).
 Im done with this place I wish you the best of luck if you choose to eat at this dump.....I have no idea how they ever received a 4 star rating. This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure. Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food, she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill. The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out. The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back . John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs. He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese, onions, peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt. Overall you would be much more satisfied going to your neighborhood Denny's than Hoosier Cafe in my opinion.I find out that Saturn has stopped making Roof Racks for my 2003 Saturn Vue which means I cannot get a Roof Rack for my Bikes for road trips, bummer deal. Then I remember how hitch racks have gotten really awesome and that I can get a hitch installed. Well who do you go to for a hitch installation? Google results show that Uhaul is the masters of the hitch install and that being that I call Uhaul. This is where the fun begins, and by fun I mean something akin to stabbing my eyes with a pencil.

There is a Uhaul, to my chagrin, very close to my house, so I figure it will be most convenient to call them. After numerous rings I get to talk with Robin. It doesn't sound like Robin is having the best of days, or years, or perhaps longer. I tell her that I would like a hitch installed on my car and we go through the make model year routine to determine what I need installed. She wants to know where I want this done, which is an odd question since I called a specific location. We get through that and she gives me the price of $179.95 for parts, labor, and warranty. She lets me know that it may be more depending on how the wiring configuration is done but I let her know that I will not need that since I am putting a bike rack on and that will be it for the foreseable future. I get a confirmation number and she emails me the receipt. I am also told that someone will contact me to setup the appointment. This is June 10th.

On June 12th, Friday, I still have not received a call so I decide to give the Uhaul location a call back to see whats up with the appointment. I offer my confirmation number but the gentleman just wants my name. He says that the appointment is set up for Wednesday June 17th. I am surprised by this since no one ever called to set that up. I ask if we can get it done on Monday June 15th instead. The gentleman says yes that will be fine and to bring it in at 8am and that it should only take 30 minutes. I enter this into my calendar and go about my weekend.

June 15th rolls around and I go to the Uhaul for my scheduled appointment for the hitch installation. I am greeted by a gentleman walking away from me to talk with another Uhaul employee, or rather Manager/Owner James Flake. After an awkward minute of me standing at the counter 5 feet away from these two gentlemen talking about their work I finally am greeted by the younger one. I let him know that I am here for my scheduled hitch install which causes him to look over my shoulder to James and laugh. He then lets me know that James will be doing the install. I ask if I should bring the car around back and he thinks this is a good plan.

As I pull around I see another customer waiting on James and can see that things are going to be moving slowly today. I wait in my car for 10 minutes until James comes up and asks if I know that this appointment is set for Wednesday. I tell him that yes I am aware that originally it was set for that that but that I had called on Friday to reschedule. He lets me know that its going to take a while as he has deliveries to take care of but that I will be his priority. I am okay with this since I have brought my book along and have no appointments till the afternoon.

10am rolls around and James Flake comes in to let me know its all done. We saddle up to the register and he tells me the total is ~$220 which I inform him is incorrect. I tell him that the total parts, labor, and warranty was quoted to me as $179.95. He snickers at me and wants to know who told me that. I explain that it was Robin to which he responds that Robin does not work there. I let him know that it is irrelevant as I was quoted $179.95 and that is what I will be paying. Another Uhaul employee comes over to see what the fuss is about and they start discussing that I was quoted the online price for the hitch which is cheaper than their price. I stand and say nothing to this.

James is still not willing to offer the price I was quoted so he lets me know that he can take the hitch off. I let him know he is welcome to do so. He then tells me that I will have to wait since he has other customers. This cracks me up because there is nothing better for your other customers than to have one who you are trying to Bait and Switch standing in your store raising hell.

Another Uhaul employee comes over and his name tag says owner as well. By this time I have found the email and let them see it. They agree to honor the price and I am on my way.

Clearly Uhaul has some communication issues between its stores and the central call center that my initial call was routed to. The first issue this caused was that I never got a call back for when the installation would occur. Second when I called to setup the installation time I talked with the store where I was apparently talking to someone too busy to actually write down the appointment that we set up. Third was the price issue.Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.STAY AWAY & Don't Waste Your Money!!
This place is terrible, there's no one here. The machine is set up to take your money & then it doesn't work!  These people need to be reported bc THEY ARE THIEVES RIPPING PEOPLE OFF!!  
There's NO PHONE NUMBER POSTED ANYWHERE (they must've gotten tired of all the complaints!) & when I called the phone number I found here online ...GUESS WHAT?  You get an annoying fax machine sound.  I think that's their way of saying F You!  
THE MACHINES DON'T WORK- The soap dispensers don't work... it's a joke!
Whoever owns this place is raking in the money & exerting ZERO EFFORT. I see a sign that says the doors automatically lock automatically at 8pm- no one even comes to lock up. (I'll bet they sneak in the back door & empty the machines at night)  They're prob afraid everyone's getting sick of their s$!+ & is waiting for them to show up!  And they SHOULD BE AFRAID!  That's what happens when you're in the biz of ripping people off!
Take my advice & stay away- drive further if you have to- bc it will be cheaper in the long run. 
I'm taking the one load I was able to put in the one machine & I'm taking it to another laundromat to dry- bc these scumbags aren't getting one more quarter from me.  Then... When I get home I'm going online to file a formal complaint.  There's enough good people in this world who are honest & appreciate our business. Life's too short to do business with CROOKS.This place is horrible.  Depressing atmosphere, poor quality food, very small portions, but high prices.  Flabby corn tortillas, very little filling (tacos, burros, quesidillas), and barely warm.  No chips available on weekdays.  Ordered items with pork and was told it was "spoiled."  I can't believe this place stays in business!I have eaten here a number of times years ago, not sure when they changed ownership or if some younger family members took over, that said, the food has gone down.  This last order, we threw most of it away.  We had ywp orders of Orange Chicken, DRY, NO taste, No Kick appeared make last week.  I'm not sure what the fourth item was, I thought I had ordered Chop Suey with chicken, what I got was a hard, Tasteless unrecognizable something.  The only good thing we received was Chicken LoMein it was good.  I'm not sure what they use to cook with MSG, not sure, but I had a sneezing fit and had to go to the bathroom.  I would call down to complain, but there is a young guy who thinks he's funny, NOT, and the rest don't care, I'm also afraid of them spitting in or doing something to my food.  I do not Recommend this restaurant .So I dropped in for a quick lunch and a soda the other day with a friend of mine.  We just wanted something small.  So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, " What?  Say again?"  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying "do you want fries with that?".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid.

When they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, "$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?".  So to get the other sandwich they charged me $4.90.  WTF??? Almost $14 for our snack/lunch?  Not only another example where you are better off going for a real lunch at places where you can get a lunch special for $5.99 or $6.99, and get good table service, and they have employees who can speak and comprehend the English language.  And even for fast food restaurants, JIB is better, cheaper, and higher in quality.

I normally do not frequent MacDonalds because I always thought they sucked.  But this place was convenient to my cause the other day, but I will now never go back again.Crappiest service ever! If they is even a remote chance you may return something go somewhere else or look at every bit of fine print on your receipt. Never shopping at a Radio Shack again!Wow!  I have lived in the area for over 10 years and love Mexican food.  Unfortunately, this is the worst food I have had in many years.  Choose another place!The First Round Draft in Gilbert is AWFUL!!!! I ordered a Ruben..easy right?? NOPE, I asked for the bread slightly toasted and it came looking like someone put it through a shredder (I was told that is how it looks if you order it like that). It had a golf ball-sized amount of meat on it. The waitress never came to see how things were and I finally had to take it to the bar where I was an inconvenience to the bartender. It still took a few minutes for someone to come over and by that time I was finished. So the waitress sad "OK" and turned around and walked away. The rest of the staff thought it was amusing. In these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way. There are MANY other places to go. DO NOT EAT HERE. When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad. Terrible service and worse food! The place was empty, I wonder why...Yuck. Wife and I have been to this place a handful of times over the 19 years we lived nearby. We certainly know it is a dive bar and were in the mood for one drink.....at a dive bar.

When we sat down, I said to the wife that it looks like they have not spent one dollar on upgrading or cleaning since we first came in 19 years later. So we ask the bartender lady about the happy hour (Sat night) specials and they are pretty reasonable. I get a a well vodka tonic and the wife a big draft.

Drinks served. As soon as I took my first sip, I was hit with the grossest odor from my drink imaginable. The only way to describe it is if you have worked under your sink and removed the p-trap. That was the smell. I asked my wife to check it out and she almost threw up. Trust me, we are not wimps or over reaching yuppies. 

I called the bartender lady over and told her my drink smells really bad and will take a beer. I also asked her if she would at least smell it as well so she could maybe figure out which of the 3 ingredients might be causing the smell....ice, vodka or tonic water. She said, no I do not need to and dumped the drink out. WTF....you would think she may want to find out the source of the issue. I did not make a big deal of the situation when I spoke to her and kept it friendly but was surprised that she did not care at all. I feel sorry for the next person who ordered the same drink. Had the girl checked out the drink and cared at all as to what may be causing the odor, I would not have written this. 

Lastly, our seats at the bar had a great view of the sinks and equipment behind the counters and to be quite frank, I cannot believe this place can pass a food inspection. 

Word to the owner(s)...read these reviews and use it as a lesson on success going forward. It is for your own good.I hate writing bad reviews but I wasn't very impressed with this place for the prices they charge. :( All was not lost though since I had printed out a coupon from their website for 20% off. The pedicure stations don't have massage chairs and I didn't think my manicure was as clean and nice as it could have been. The lady who did my nails was super nice but I don't think I'll be returning to Total Bliss unless it's for a different kind of service.Just went there recently and I honestly thought the place was closed and getting ready to move because it was super cluttered, knick knacks everywhere and a stench of mold that was only slightly tolerable. The people were nice but I did still get a Silence of the Lambs vibe from them, enough for me to choose a table farthest from them. They also charged me an extra $2.00 for using a card to pay for a $3.70 drink and did not inform me that would happen! To give them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume there was a sign that I happened to not see that informs patrons of this. By the time my friend arrived, I had already sent her a text that said "Pretty sure these people are going to skin me alive". My friend wanted to order a burger from them but like other people mentioned, I strongly question the uphold of health codes in the joint. We left and actually went to Panda Express because even that was a step above the Coffee Cove.Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)On 11-19-10 @ 1:49 PM, I ordered a single hamburger with a bowl of chili.
The girl turned the chili pot up on its side to get only a half bowl. Then a guy came over and scraped a little more out of the pot, charged me $5.32 and gave it to me.
I ate the hamburger while reading some lit up sign exclaiming that FRESH IS BEST. Then took a spoon of chili and spit it out. I told the girl of the problem and she said she has more chili on the stove and did I want some. No way and I left. I called the number on the receipt to complain and some guy did not want to talk and told me to call the 800 # on the receipt. I told him there was no #. I told him--I will handle this a different way and here it is--I AM A YELPER!
I told my wife about it and when I mentioned the location, she told me she hates that place and does not go there. And as you can see, NEITHER WILL I.

However, most Wendy's are good places to eat.Hate this place!!! I came here under the new management and it was the worst experience of my life. I went to get a pedicure and asked for the callous remover and the owner took too much off. Yes, it was the owner! He kept talking about other nail salons and how his is better and how they focus on the customer experience. I could barely walk for 3 days!! It was so tender and just hurt way too much. I never had this happen to me before and I hope no one ever experiences this. I don't care how good the place may look but if you can't do your job and just worry about your business, maybe you should pick a different profession.I agree with Anna. I am a long time Gilbert resident and used this service center exclusively for years. After Mark Boley left and Tom took over, the place went to hades in a handbasket quickly.  The old nickel and dime routine was too much for me. They told my daughter she needed $600+ front end repair when all she needed was a simple alignment. They did a "tune-up" on my son's truck, only to find out a  month later at another facility they never changed the spark plugs.  I have since gone to the Goodyear on Baseline. Still have to watch out with some of their quotes. NOBODY needs a nine year battery in Arizona.  ;)Food is pretty good cheap (on the menu)the waitress is the owner and she will trip you off add charge you way too Much for stuff and then go crazy on you off if you mention it or tell her that your food is wrong. She is very rude and sassy. .. NEVER GOING BACK which is sad because it is a cute little diveWent for lunch  closed   All signs are off the building no notice. What happened?   Pfft gone!Let me start by saying that if I could give this place less than one star... I wouldn't hesitate.

We took our van to AAMCO because we had an oil leak. That's it. One problem. After looking at our van we were told that our few hundred dollar problem was actually a $1200 problem because we also needed to replace our rack and pinion. Knowing nothing about cars we believed the manager of the shop (Bill) and gave him our money. When we got the van back everything seemed to be in order and we were happy. Bill was even nice enough to knock off some money to save us some trouble. They were closing for the day so they couldn't take care of the alignment that we needed done to finish the job. 

A day later we heard this horrible knocking noise in the front of the van. We called Bill and he asked us to bring it back. We took the van back in to find out our front shocks had suddenly gone bad. So now we have another $1200 problem on our hands that magically appeared AFTER taking our van to this AAMCO location. We exchanged words with Bill and got nothing but excuses and blame on us for not bringing the vehicle back sooner, and the large amount of miles... etc. According to Bill, there is no possible way that it was their fault. So now that our shocks are bad, we couldn't get the alignment completed. As a result our van has been pulling right for weeks and our front tires are completely bald. 

The day the excuses started we asked Bill for the phone number of the owner so we could get this issue worked out. Bill absolutely REFUSED to give us his number but he told us that the owner would call us back. Well... that never happened. Not only that, we have called and spoken to Bill on numerous occasions and get the same story. The owner is out of town, he's busy, he will call you back. The most recent time we spoke to Bill he said that the owner was not going to call us back because he told Bill to "handle" it. Well Bill's idea of handling the situation is to not call us, refuse to provide a number to complain to, and do absolutely nothing to help us. The customer service at this AAMCO is absolutely horrible and I will do everything I can to ensure they don't receive business from anybody I know.

We got screwed by this AAMCO location and I hope you read this review and decide to take your vehicle elsewhere.The Summary:
- AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.
- Would give it ZERO stars if I could.
- Came in with small brake issue and a check engine light. Diagnosed with 4 days and $1200-$1700 repair
- Arrived three times to pick up the car only to find it had another issue.
- Left three weeks and $2500 later with the same brake issue, new engine issues, and a worse transmission issue.
- Jack seems like a nice guy but hes either maliciously ripping people off or his people are incompetent.

The Story:
Had a 2002 VW Jetta with engine power issues and a check engine light. My own diagnostic tool showed some cylindar misfires. We brought it to Jack's Napa AutoCare Center on a referral from a body shop. They quoted us $1200 to $1700 for a new water pump (which broke) and possibly new heads and a head gasket. We trusted Jack because he seemed like a geniune guy. It was supposed to be done in 4 days, which turned into a 11 days because of "shipping delays" from Volkwagen. My girlfriend had them look at the brakes, which they replaced the rear brake pads on.

It was supposed to be done on the 11th day so I drove to that side of town just to find out "a new issue came up". I shrugged it off and let them work on fixing it. It finally came time to pick it up so I drove across the city and we couldn't even drive it out of the parking lot because the brakes suddenly didn't work. The check engine light also instantly came on with a new code related to the Crankshaft Position Sensor. I went back in severely annoyed after almost two weeks and two attempts to pick it up.

Jack assured me that next time I was back the car would be in tip-top shape. He also explained that it needed a new brake booster and "unfortunately it's the expensive one". We paid for a $300 brake booster and let them get back to work. A few days later it was ready to be picked up. The brakes worked just as they had when I dropped it off (after new pads and a new brake booster, both recommended by Jack). The cylindar misfire codes were gone, but the check engine light came on with yet ANOTHER code related to the Mass Airflow Sensor. Regardless, we wanted to be done with Napa so we left just to find that an existing small transmission fliud leak had ended up as a full blown transmission issue. In fairness they did throw in the labor for the brake "fix" for free.

I later found out that the battery had been disconnected (battery case was re-installed backwards), most likely in an attempt to clear the check engine light in a shady way. We sold the car as a "mechanics special".just wanna update. We end up getting the stock cabinets from home depot with a lot cheaper price(with the same layout) + warranty + no assembly cost + free truck to get your cabinets+ ready to pick up.

So, stay away from this store!!!!While we were happy with the quality of the cabinets we received here, the customer service was abysmal. If you don't mind not getting phone calls returned and constantly badgering for the latest status, go somewhere else. You might end up paying a little more, but it will be worth it in the end.Left numerous voice mail messages and emails - none returned.  Business must be good to ignore potential customers.  Look elsewhere for someone that is interested in your business.Really disappointed by this place. Had relatives in town for a wedding And needed same-day laundry service. I called the place like 8:45 AM to ask about same-day service and was told, "as long as you are hereby 10 AM." I arrived at 9:40 AM with the close and asked the lady to have them laundered same-day and she told me, "sorry. They already picked up the bags." She was very polite about it In fact she was a bit snarky In her tone. I pointed at this HUGE sign that they have hanging in the store that reads in big letters IN BY 10 OUT BY 5 And I Told her it was 20 min. before 10 and she again said sorry and that was it. This really threw a wrench  in my day because by this time I was too late to go to a different dry cleaner. If you're going State same-day service 10 to 5 Then don't tell people on the phone to be there by 10 AM. Or have An advertisement sign stating that fact. It's false advertising  and a disservice to customers.Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!

The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  

Don't be fooled by this "gourmet" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.

when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.

skip this joint....and save your money.didn't they close already?. we wasted $23 on a all organic gluten free pizza that took them an hour to deliver less than 1/2 mile, and it was tasteless and the size of half a large pizza.So Let me start off by first saying I am from New Jersey on the Shore. I use to eat pizza once a week if not more. I have recently moved out to Arizona, I've been trying pizza from all places. Rush Street pizza is near by my house so I decided to order from the pizzeria. 

I ordered 2 Large Pizzas, One half pepperoni and half cheese. The 2nd pizza was half olives and half chicken and bacon. We also decided to get some garlic knots. 

The pizza arrives at the house. I open the pizza and it looks amazing. I go to bite into a slice of pepperoni and it is absolutely disgusting. There is no sauce, parts of the pizza is over seasoned and parts are under seasoned. 

I called back up, only to hear they told me I am wrong for ordering it that way. I never once ordered, in my life, a pizza with no sauce, unless it is a white pizza. This case is not a white pizza. At this moment, I am very furious and asked the guy politely to exchange my pizzas and try to make them a better, and of course with sauce. He was very mean and finally decided I could order two pizzas again and only have to pay half price. The pizza right now is in the trash waiting for the birds. Dont be mistaken by the reviews that are 4 or 5 stars. Management and whom ever makes the food is very new to the pizza industry. I have tried other places. if your looking to spend 20 to 40 dollars here, DONT! You can spend less amount of money at Dominos, papa johns and get more for your money and actually enjoy the taste of the food, This is a Mickey Mouse operation. Very disappointed.What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.

How are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.  

Valley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.

Bad Chinese food fast!The worst service in all of Chandler.i have been here a dozen times and it never improves. Takes 10 minutes to get a menu and silverware. Another 10 minutes to place an order and then 30 minute to make an egg. I am a person who enjoys supporting non-big chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service. The village in is only 2 miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek.I was horribly disappointed by my landscaping job.  My father-in-law passed so I had to leave the state.  I was not there to oversee the landscaping job.   When I returned, they gave me the WRONG rock for my front yard and didn't have enough for the back.  When they returned weeks later with the rock, it was incorrect yet again--I just dealt with it.   They didn't finished putting in all the scrubs and trees and I had to call a number of times to get it done.  This yard project was done a few years ago and I still am bitter about it.Let me start off by saying I've been here once before for eyebrows and they didn't turn out so well. I ended up with scabs on both my eyebrows for two weeks (not too pretty). Now let me start my review on my nails... They made it a bit difficult for me to make an appointment, but since I was leaving town they could squeeze me in. I got there, was seated pretty quickly, and then chose my color. I decided to go with gels, I've done them before so I knew the process fairly well. There was absolutely no room in their "nail salon" section. I didn't feel as if my girl did my nails well what-so-ever. I feel bad to name her, because in all honestly she was extremely sweet just had no idea how to do proper gels or a standard pedicure. My gels were soft, and had indents in them. Gels are supposed to be hard so that kind of thing doesn't happen. Now my pedicure... It was awful! She didn't know how to do an even coat. I do not understand. I do a much better job. So I called the manager, Nikki I believe was her name. All she did was make excuses for the girl saying oh maybe it was bad lighting or a bad curing machine for the gels. Seriously?? I would never go back there to see any nail tech. They offered to do my nails again but honestly it was so uncomfortable in there and everyone had to keep moving around each other. Save your money and find an actual nail salon where they have some massage chairs and space!First experience here was with my mother. Food was great our waitress was pleasant but I actually think we got more help from the buss boy who I ended up tipping.  So second time was with my fiance and after this experience I will not ever return first my fiance is weird and doesn't eat with metal utensils so we asked the hostess for plastic ones and she said she would return with some and never did. No big deal she is only a host.. anyway our waitress was awful.. tired, lazy and I had to ask her for a hot sauce like 5 times she never offered to refill my drink however anytime my fiance was running low she seemed to notice she had a horrible attitude towards us both, my guess she was hung over..  Still no excuse. Terrible terrible service from the waitresses however the buss boys do an amazing job with assisting customers and are most of the reason I returned a second time. However the waitresses ruined it and I'm never going back and wouldn't recommend it for someone who is actually looking to enjoy where they eat.Wednesday around 4 PM. There was no receptionist and I waited 20 minutes, still no one. I left. Don't even bother coming hereWOW! Really? A 4 star rating on Yelp? That's a load of crap and I'm sorry I didn't read Jeff F.'s review before we plunked down down about $30 for the crappiest Mexican food I've had in a long time. 

We were in town from San Diego for a wedding and looked up our taco shop possibilities on Yelp and found this. Sadly, I didn't take my own advice and see further than just the 4 stars...the topper is that the customer service is as it is many times in a Mexican restaurant, shitty. The counter girl acted like we were doing her a favor and even when my mom and I spoke to her in Spanish, she didn't say a word. Perhaps she was having a bad day or didn't give a shit but when she called you to the window to pick up your food, she waved you over quite dismissively and then walked away. WTF? The joint is as small as a cracker box at a Greyhound station and just as clean...yikes! 

I'm a Mexican and I'm used to some highly seasoned, tasty grub of all kinds here in SD and this place wouldn't last a week in any part of our city, especially in the hood where they serve REAL street tacos. 

We ordered: 
2 plates @ $11.99 each with a variety of 9 street tacos, the only decent ones were the tacos de cabeza and everyone wanted one, so I only scored one. Shit. The rest of them, adobado, al pastor and carne asada tasted like dog food. The adobado meat had a weird, nutmeggy taste...gross. No salt, no life, no zest, and the damn street tortillas were cold. If you sold street tacos like this in TJ, you'd get your ass kicked in a second. 

1 Carne Asada burrito: full of beans, rice and tiny, over chopped up chunks of something that must have once been a decent piece of carne asada. Lame ass and looked like dog food. 

Beans and rice on the side: Out of any can would've been better than this crap. 

Drinks: My husband wanted a Pepsi was told there was none, only Coke. Yeah you dumb lady, only Coke from the dispenser but there was Pepsi in cans and we were looking right at them. 

Salsa bar: How is it possible to screw up a salsa bar? What a bummer.Save your money and time and go somewhere else, because even if the food is dull and flavorless like this food, you might get better CS.I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!

We ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, "The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes."  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.

After waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: "Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend."  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?

A few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, "We were just going to leave."  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.

I used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.Had plans to go to breakfast at RNR but they were closed at 10:30 am so we Yelped it and found Orange Table at the top of the Yelp list with lots of good reviews.  

This place is pretty hard to find.  Had to stop and ask 3 people, make 1 phone call to restaurant, and husband running all over trying to find.  Finally found it unfortunately!  Its a cute little place.  We had hoped the food was going to be as good as the reviews say it is but no not really. 

 My husband had banana pancakes with side of bacon.  Pancakes were honestly no joke the worst I have ever had.  I literally spit it out in my napkin.  Husband said it wasnt that bad but he wouldnt have it again.  I had a mushroom omelet with a cream sherry sauce.  It really was not that good to me.  That sauce would have been great on a piece of steak but it was just a weird pairing in an omelet to me and the taste I just couldnt get past.  One bite and I forced myself to try another bite just to be sure and ya I was sure yuck no good I pushed it away.  

Unfortunately my waitress was busy in deep conversation with the table next to us so she didnt know there was a problem until my husband was completely done.  She offered to have something else made but 1/3 of the breakfast menu was corned beef which I am not that fond of and nothing else sounded that great so I declined.  

She brought the bill back and gave us half off the meal I couldnt eat because it tasted awful so for that, my husbands 2 pancakes and bacon along with a mocha the bill was $35.  That kinda pissed me off so I asked her if she could please do something about it because I literally ate a bite and it just wasnt good.  It was so much not good that I just wanted out of there.  She said I dont know I will have to ask the owner so I said ok and then she walked over to the cash register took it off without asking anyone and then drop it off again.  

So 2 lousy pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, and 1 coffee $20 with a $3 tip.  Asked the hub would you go back he said NO.  I of course would never go back.  Oh well better luck next time.  

Check out the unfiltered reviews.  Lots of bad reviews there.  They seem to have had the same experience I had.  They have to be paying people to review them positively.Total brunch fail. 

11:15 - Two friends and I arrived at the restaurant on a Sunday. We put in our name for a table, were told we would have a 20 minute wait. 

11:35 - 20 minutes after we were told we had a 20 minute wait. Was our table ready? Nope. 

11:50 - Still no table. There were a few tables that had been open since we arrived. 

11:55 - Finally got seated. Placed our order right away and asked for waters.  

12:15 - It took 20 minutes to get waters. Water glasses were dirty. 

12:30 - Almost 40 minutes after ordering, our server came out to tell us there was a 'problem with the ticket' and this is why our food was taking so long. (Translation - she forgot to put in our order.) The table next to us (who sat and ordered after us) had already eaten and cashed out before our food arrived. Did our server offer to bring us bread or anything since she screwed up our order and we were starving? Nope. 

12:45 - Food finally arrived almost an hour after ordering. Food was not good. My friend ordered the banana walnut pancakes (recommended by our server) and they were mushy and not cooked through in the middle. She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted. We had ordered a side of bacon to share and it was overly greasy, and the eggs benedict my other friend and I ordered had obviously been sitting for some time - the hollandaise sauce had started to congeal. Congealed hollandaise - yummm.  

We asked to talk to manager (we were surprised she didn't come over on her own) - she was very unapologetic and condescending, popping over briefly to say "I heard you had a bad experience."  They discounted our food but we all barely ate -  very disappointing brunch! 

With so many great breakfast/brunch spots in the area, we won't be returning to Orange Table.We had trouble finding this place and had to call them twice for directions as the hostess/phone answerer did not know where they were located apparently. The food was really undercooked and slow to get. The waiter was super nice and we did not have to pay for the few bites we did consume. My friend got the monkey cakes, which were undercooked.  I got "the hatch" which said it was chicken breast, but appeared to be chicken breast lunch meat. We won't be rushing back.Mediocore at best. Sat on patio which was dirty and had 1/2 a dz. empty, dirty, planting pots sort of laying there like discarded rubbish. Planter in the middle of patio could have added so much, but alas, just had 3 non used heaters propped up against the wall, one of those discarded planters and ...idk..gravel, dead grass? 

Food: I got the yogurt/granola/fruit. In the height of berry season, no berries, just the cheapest pieces of fruit - 1/2 a strawberry cut up to little pieces, couple of pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew and then some red grapes. The granola was store bought, bland, nothing special. 

Bottom line- don't bother. 

I was really hoping for a cute/quaint/good food place here. If it was ever good, they are resting on their past glory. It is NOT worth a stop in unless you're desperate for a cup of coffee.Came in for scan. Was given questionable water in a white plastic container with a paper cup and told to drink it all. I asked about where it came from and was told from the staff kitchen and it was not tap water. I was given a second white plastic container with water right before my scan and asked to drink it. 
I felt very uncomfortable with this procedure because there was no way of knowing  

1 Water source 

2. cleanliness of container that gets reused, refilled over and over again 

3. total disregard of operating a professional lab by giving out questionable and unsanitary water instead of a sealed bottle of water. This caused a lot of stress. 

4.Later on I callied in and spoke to Nicki, the office manager and related info above to her. I was told that I was the first person to complain, thus shaming me for bringing an unsanitary practice to her attention.  

 I am writing this review so that if it happens to you, know that you are NOT the first person to question this unsanitary practice.

I hope SMIL decides to change this reckless practice and use sealed bottled water so that there are no questions or worries.Oh NO!  A disappointment, again. 

I was too late for lunch and the same old bartender had the same old line while I listened to the same old music from the same old guitar player. OK, so the guitar player is the BEST thing this place has to offer. 

Last time I was there, the bartender also was the cook and the waiter while the owner stood at the end of the bar and sipped from his "water" pitcher. 

Come on now, Cowboy. Saddle up and give us something new on a Sunday afternoon. How 'bout a coupla Cowgirls serving beer and nibbles that don't stop at 4pm. Maybe you could smile once in awhile and welcome your guests and make them happy to stay longer. 

If I could buy your business, I would call it the SILVER SPUR and nothing "RUSTY" about that. Yee Ha!!I haven't been here in a long time but now I know why.  It was overpacked and the crowd was awful.  Felt like I was in a bad part of Phoenix or something.  Very trashy.  When I went to go to the bathroom, some guy was smoking a black and mild or something INDOORS by the hallway!!  ugh would not willingly return to this dump.Took a 3-year-old Seiko Perpetual Calendar watch in for battery replacement.  When I dropped it off the employee/owner? told me he could replace the battery, but wouldn't set the calendar.  I told him no problem, as I'd done it before and had the instructions.  I was frankly surprised at his comment.  It's not that tough.

Got the watch back, paid my $17, and left.  When I got home, I noticed the date was stuck between 11 and 12.  No problem, I thought..  I'll do a full reset and just start from scratch.  

The first simple step is to pull the crown out one click, hold the button for two seconds, and wait for the watch to drive the second hand to zero, and the date to 1.

The second hand drove to 10, and the date never budged.  The watch worked perfectly until the battery began running low a few weeks ago.  In 30 minutes he managed to mess up the internal workings of my watch.  Guess that's why he was reluctant to agree to actually set it when he finished.

I'll go to a certified Seiko repair facility from now on.My husband and I went here for the Living Social deal ($40 for $20). Not sure it was worth it. The service was great, our waiter was really nice and helpful. But our portions were quite small and the dishes overpriced. For instance, my husband's side salad had one slice of tomato in it (pretty sad looking) and the bruschetta was just 4 bland and boring slices. My chicken marsala was alright, but still stingy, even with the sauce. The house wine was decent, but I'm not sure if it was worth $9 per glass. Also, the place is pretty small so the tables are quite close together. This wouldn't have been a problem if it didn't require the waiter to keep putting his backside over our table while he was leaning to pour water for the table next to us. It was embarrassing for all involved, though I don't think he noticed. Overall, we were pretty unimpressed with this restaurant.I always here great stuff about this place.

The food and service totally suck.

The tortillas are pretty good and the scenery is great but seriously, a blind homeless guy could cook better.

Complete rip off, dont believe the hype.You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.
Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.

You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. 
Nope.
This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,

Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.
Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.

Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.
Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.
Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???

And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) 

Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.
Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.

But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.
Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.
Oh well, who cares...right?
There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. 

Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? 
You both have so much in common.I went there again had the Margarita pizza. 

It was soggy, and tasted like a wet foot. The sauce wasn't good and the grated Parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can. 

They say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?

If you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.

So this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad.SHC has the best, cleanest ER BUT if you get submitted to the hospital, it's the worst hospital ever!! 

I won't bore you with the many complaints I had during my stay, but if you can avoid being submitted to this hospital, do whatever you can. Going back when I was being taken to the ER, I would have taken a longer trip if that meant I could have stayed at a better hospital. So just ONE of the BAJILLION complaints I have about this hospital is...

They are under staffed and the nurses are witches. After my surgery I had to pee (sorry if that's TMI) but I couldn't get to the bathroom on my own so I paged a nurse. NO ONE came around for an HOUR. Towards the end of that hour I was paging the nurses every two seconds. Still nada. 

Finally, I grabbed my cell phone, called 411 and had them connect me with the hospital, I spoke with a receptionist and had to ask her if someone would please come to my room to help me. It was after that a nurse actually came to help me. Can you believe that??

There are a lot of elderly people in this part of town too and they probably would have just been left there to crap all over themselves or been ignored. If you have a grandparent or know an older person staying here, get them transferred.

other issues in the eyes of someone on pain meds:
-they didn't toast my bagel and it made me cry. through tears i said to my sister, 'they didn't toast my bagel!!!' and then i'm pretty sure i through it on the floor. but that parts a bit blurry. 
- they didn't knock before barging into my room in the middle of the night, which scared me and made me cry. through tears i said, 'can you please knock??!!'

issues not related to pain meds:
- you have to share a room. yuck. my roommate was a farter.
- the nurses are evil. they don't pay attention to the needles and tubes INSIDE of your SKIN when they go to take your blood pressure!! imagine having those ripped out of your arm bc the nurse isn't paying attention
-in order to leave they make the head dr or nurse or something check you out. we waited 6 hours waiting for the nurse person while the nurses kept telling us to hold on, it should be soon. and then we found out it wasn't necessary and they finally let us leave. 
- the nurses argue. see conversation below:
"samantha- are you in pain? do you need more pain meds?'
'yes'
'you must not be in pain if you're sleeping'
'i'm not asleep'
'your eyes are closed'
'ummm, i'm responding aren't i? i'm not asleep'
'well if you were in pain it would be impossible for you to lay here calmly'
'can you please stop arguing with me? i am in pain so please stop arguing with me'Did not enjoy living here.  A very badly designed residential complex.Good location, but management nickle and dimes you on everything. Charges you for  parking even if they don't put signs up for your spot.  Had a 20% increase in rent from 2011-2012.  Loud garage if you live next to it.  Faulty entrance gates to the complex and they won't replace the old locks.  I also hope you like being woke up at 8am sharp on the weekdays, because that is when the landscaping company starts cutting grass and blowing leaves about 3 days a week.  That being said...have fun living at the Palladium!I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I had the worst bar experience I've ever had at Giligin's. Here's what happened: A friend of mine and I ordered some food which turned out to be horrible. When we complained to the waitress, she brought the owner to the table (who happened to be working the front door). So, this rather wide man walks over and when we told him about the food, he proceeds to grab a fork off our table and shove a bite of each item we had ordered into his mouth. With his mouth still full of food he barked: "The food is fine, pay for it." all-the-while spitting pieces of chewed food over us and our table. Then he walked off. In disbelief of what had just happened, we called him back over to speak with him again. The owner was polite enough to come back over and threaten to sic his bouncers on us. Do not go to Giligin's, the place is disgusting.Came here with a friend on a tuesday when they do 'Gold Fish Racing'. The lady who MC's the whole thing was extremely vulgar and offensive. If you enjoy seeing people made fun with racist and sexist comments and jokes, you might enjoy this place, until you become the target of the remarks.The Girl Bartender is rude and lacks the most basic concept of customer service.  In times past, I had frequented Gilligan's, however, with the overwhelming options in old Town, I will no longer bring my business to Gilligan's.  There are many other bars that offer, not only better food, but better atmosphere and a more friendly experience.  For Example:  Bungalow.  There is no point in wasting your time and money at Gilligans.Compared to the other Walmarts in the area, this place should be torn down to the ground.  It looks old and outdated.  This isn't a Super Walmart.  It's dirty and filthy.  Stained walls and floors, the racks look like they haven't been cleaned in years.  Ugh!

I don't understand why people still go here.  I guess it's close but the products on the shelves are nothing compared to other Walmarts.  I only go here is I need shampoo or kitty litter.NOT A 24 HOUR STORE!! Even though it says so in Walmart.com... And I hate false advertising... Especially at 5:30 in the morningThis has got to be the worst pharmacy of all the Walgreens stores! They are always so busy never enough staff how to handle the amount of people.I lived in a apartment belongs to this company for 1 year and 3 months and here are my comments.
Pros: large rooms, good service team.

Cons: 
1. Pricy. For a apartment in the middle of no where they charge over a $1000 for a one bed and jack the rent 10% every year.
2. Highly greedy. They tried to rob me two months early termination fee without stating in lease; trying to take all my security deposit for cleanning even I have done my part well enough.
3. Management team is good when you paying the rent, once you want to leave they turned into cold stones. Trying to take as many penny as they can.
4. 200 people with only one pool that is shared with another apartment building, total of 500 people in summer but only one pool to use.
5. Laundry room is horrible. Water leak a lot.

Don't recommend to live with this company's property at any level. I am an angry customer who don't felt being treated correctly.The mutitude of billing errors everyone in our group has experienced is unacceptable from a resort of this caliber.  I have been trying to get assistance since yesterday morning and have yet to get a call back from someone who cares. The resort itself is beautiful.I new this place sucked from the last time I ate here but for some odd reason I was tempted to eat here again well I was right it still sucks I had a hankering for spagetti and meatballs first I will say the sauce was watery and had very little flavor the meat balls tasted like a lot of filler and also had a strange flavor the bread stick was ok ...Hmmm...the conversation went something like this:

Me: I'd like to get this skirt hemmed.
Her: I can do that; it would take approximately 10 days.
Me: And what is the cost?
Her: Twenty eight dollars ($28.00).
Me: [Choking] What!?  $28.00!?
Her: Honey, if you don't want to pay that, you don't have to.  I don't have time for this [walking away from me and the front of the store].
Me: OK.  I guess that's settled [walking away from her and out the front door].

I guess this establishment doesn't need the money...nor the goodwill.Went here on a Groupon type deal.  The deal was too good to be true and as is with most things in life, that is correct.  I rolled up to a very old looking and dated "salon". My nail tech was 30 minutes late. When she did arrive, she and the owner gave me a lesson in what I wanted done. Fine. Then, it took 4 hours to get done what normally would take 1.5 AND IT ONLY LASTED ONE WEEK!!! My nails literally started to lift and come off and when I text the pictures to said Nail Tech, she told me she was booked and couldn't fit me in. Do not go here! Waste of time and money.Air conditioning was not functioning at a summer event called WINTERFEST.  Seriously?

It may be an okay place to go to see an event, but I wouldn't risk planning an event there.  Big time disaster.Beware of Brandi!!!! She is the Rudest and Most Unfriendly employee I have come across in many years.  She carries the biggest "I could care less about the customer attitude" possible.  Before I could even order my 2nd item she turned he back on me and started packing the first item I ordered.  When I asked a question about ordering wings pcs. She was very short and snappy with her response. When asked a follow up question she answered "that's the way it is NOW" It was as if she was a robot on an assembly line screwing nuts on a bolt. While still trying to complete my order and talking to her, she begins taking an order from a drive- through customer and ignoring me.  Note: The restaurant was not busy.

As a result of her, I decided pay for the one item and leave. I did not ordering the other chicken items, sides, and desserts I normally order when I do take out from KFC. Todays' check was only 14.00 I usually spend over 40.00 at this location for takeout. 

I then went down the street to Church's Chicken to complete my order.  I prefer KFC's food but the service was much better at Church's. 

She alone is reason enough for me not to return to this location.Once was enough for me. Parking is a pain. The place is small and cramped as well as hot. They do offer drop off service which even though I haven't used it has to be better then trying to do laundry in this hotbox. I prefer the self serve laundry on mckellips across from the police station.OK, so what if it's an authentic 1950s ice cream parlor? The stuff they're scooping up is boring major brand-name label ice cream full of air, and the toppings are nothing special? And the wallpaper is dirty and faded? And the carnival-esque decor is kinda creepy, unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here staring sadly off into space as their ice cream sodas melt away? You can almost imagine the opening scenes of a tear-jerker Lifetime movie set here. That's not good.Been here a couple of times.  The ice cream is ordinary.. whipped cream from a can.  Wouldn't give it a second thought if it wasn't located in the heart of Old Town.  But you know, when you your hours say your open to 10:00 PM you should be open until 10:00 PM.Just getting home from celebrating my son's 5th b-day, a night I will never forget!! Recomended to go to this Sugar Bowl that it would be a true B-Day treat I would not expect coming home to share what a HORRIBLE experience my whole family and I went through. Something I thought would be so simple, guess not for this Sugar Bowl. Starting with a 33 min wait to be greated by a server that had the excuse of she thought we were taken care of by someone else is not exceptable. Can't u see there's no drinks on our table? Then, the food comes out and every dish is made incorrectly. Server says, she's new and wasn't sure what there food looks like. Well didn't you study the menu & have to take a test on it before getting a section? Then, after our food was remade I gotta say FYI in my opinion, you can get a way tastier patty melt at the waffle house.. The server mentioned the Manager would be over shortly with apologies & most likely fix the bill.. I am not looking for a free bee but a Manager visit would of been nice. DIDN'T HAPPEN, yet I watched him hesitate over n over to walk our tables way, yet instead of doing so I guess he just was hoping the problems occurring would just disappear as he continued to eat food right by the kitchen door. And the problems,THEY DIDN'T GO AWAY instead, got much worse. Now it's time for a Birthday Ice Cream Treat. Well, seems like the whole table gets there ice cream 1st as I watch my son's melt away and have to explain to my 5yr old way he doesn't have his. My son, the look of sadness in his eye's tore this Mother up. The server says they are fixing it up nice..as I LMFAO, b/c I can see they are just adding more whip to cover up the melty mess and sticking a candle in it.. By the time they came out to sing Happy Birthday, I was Singing in tears!! My son should not have had to watch everyone else eat ice cream and then wait longer for his while they tried to fix there mistakes. As a person whom has been in FnB for over 15 yrs, including Managment & General Managment after serving in high volume establishments, would NEVER recommend this place to go.Exspecially for a celebration. And to the Server whom never came to apoligize to us before leaving, if you can't own your mistakes and show some sympathy on behalf of the place your working at, then I highly suggest to get out of this career now, it's not ment to be. Suger Bowl, thank you for making a night to never forget. I will never forget to tell people what your place is like..Everything was fine until we saw a cockroach roaming around the shelves behind the counter where we were sitting.   When we finished we were sitting there for awhile before one of the staff finally brought us our check.  I wanted to get change for a tip, but there was nobody at the cashier and none of the workers bothered to acknowledge us.  During this time (and it was NOT busy) several workers were just standing around talking.  When one of them walked by with his face buried in his phone, I'd had enough.  Left a .50 cent tip that was frankly too much for the lousy service, but we'd have been there another 20 minutes just to get our change.  

The cool, old-fashioned ice cream parlor we were hoping for was in actuality a dirty dump with bush league service.  Derp.Thank you for ruining my Saturday afternoon.

It's been 15 hours since I ate here and I am just now starting to feel normal again.  I've been eating tums and chasing them with soda (to settle my stomach) as well as making several bathroom trips.  I have never been this sick from eating anywhere.  I think Taco Bell would have been far superior and they don't even serve real meat!
    
The chips and salsa were okay.  My bf and I split the cheese crisp with beef (first mistake).  The beef looked grey  and the cheese looked old and overcooked. My entree was the chicken burrito,  I think they use chicken in a can b/c the meat was so dry and shredded.  The waitress offered a sauce on top and good thing I accepted b/c otherwise I would have had to choke down the dry burro.  

Gordon Ramsey needs to take over and revamp this place.  The location is prime but it seems like they were just being lazy all around.  I think they need to pare down the menu because there are too many choices and most of it is the same crap just re-worded.  Also, I kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit.  If you don't have any tables you could be helping out in other ways.     This place really lacked warmth from the staff and I think it's important to make your customers feel welcome. 

I really don't see myself coming here ever again unless they make huge changes.A poor example of Mexican food in Phoenix. The food was mediocre, the service terrible, and the prices far too high for this lack of quality. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well. The margaritas lacked any real taste and we were charged $35 for the pitcher (price not listed on the menu). When we tried to voice our concerns to the manager, we were told too bad, that's the way it is. This place is just a tourist trap in Old Town Scottsdale.I've been waiting to review my neighborhood Starbucks until I could at least give it a 1 star, since zero is not an option.  They get one star for firing the unpleasant barista that made my Saturday morning visits miserable.  It is inevitable that every time I go to this Starbucks, I either get terrible service, or I get good service and they mess up my order.  This is not the place where "everybody knows your name", because they don't ask!  Wasn't that the premise of Starbucks when they first opened? Everyone's name was on their cup?  I want my name on my cup!!!! Despite my complaining, I continue to go back, every week... Why? Because I'm a sucka!Above the door when you enter it says "you will find truth inside" and the truth is..... Its awful at kazimierz.

Made reservations for 8 at Peters food spot Cowboy Ciao. Also put down my creditcard to hold a spot for 8 at kazimierz for nye. Dinner was great, I dropped a grand on it (overpriced for atmosphere) walked into kazimierz where the owner Peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows. Very very rude owner and bouncer. they lost our name off the list then stuck us in a waiting area by the front and tried to pawn it off as our intended reserved private table. No dice Kaz, we are off to another bar... Ps the comped champaign was flat. Big let down. Big attitude.Interesting place.  Worst service in Scottsdale.  Prices are ridiculous - $25.00 per glass of unknown cabernet.  Better to go to Fifth and Wine.  Rip-offs.For a place with such an interesting and hopeful menu, I was terribly disappointed. Putting chile powder on everything does not make the dish flavorful and is far from creative. Will not be back. Decent service though and would try f n b next door.Cowboy Ciao used to be a spot I went to about 8 or 9 years ago.  I decided to go there again due to nostalgia reasons, and it didn't live up to my expectations at all.  

To start off, the food was not as great as it used to be.  The scallops had a sour after taste to them which I attributed to being in the smoker way too long, and they needed a better sear.  The wild boar meatballs needed more seasoning. The duck confit relleno was pretty good, but the batter was oily and fell right off the chile.

Next off, we got seated in the brightly lit room to the left as you walk in.  The room resembles nothing of the ambiance of the rest of the place.  I was turned off by the faux wall artwork.  The waitress seemed rush every time she came to us, and it showed with her missing our mushroom pan fry order.

It's hard to explain what it was like being there.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you just wanted to leave after being there for 10 minutes?  Bad service, so so food, and being in a room that reminded me of the olive garden leads to wholly bad experience.

With so many other good restaurants such as NOCA, FNB, Herb Box near by, I won't ever recommend this place to anyone again.Stopped by today. They were having a cheerleading fundraiser for a local high school. We waited 40 minutes for our food. My lemonade was not refilled the entire time. Food is set down. Right away I can tell my wife's avacado on her salad had been sitting out for quite some time. It is browned. Everything on my plate, a regular slam, is cold. I left, no charge. Upset enough to drive to ihop 6 miles away. 2 out of 10, would not eat here again. To be fair I believe it was the waitress' fault and not the kitchen.I have made my last trip to this place.  A more fitting name would be The Original House of Rules...I ordered scrambled eggs and sausage...asked what it came with...they said potatoes or toast...I asked if I could substitute fruit for the starch (something I never get resistance on anywhere else)...no...so I opt for rye toast...they say whole wheat...I guess that will have to do...and ordered the small portion of fruit on the side for $3.75...bananas and strawberries...what, no melon - its definitely in season?  No melon...strawberries and bananas.  No cell phones (which doesn't bother me - I always leave my phone in the car when I dine)...no credit or debit cards...just cash...no gift cards...just cash.  And if you didn't know about that rule and don't have enough, you can step up to the Original ATM Machine and pay $2.50 to get the cash to pay the bill.  Maybe its just me, but I'm used to establishments being a little more customer friendly and flexible.   The food was just okay.  Not even close to good enough to justify all the rules and inflexibility.Where do I start? I have been to an orginal pancake house in California which was nice and had very good food. This one however I think was the very first originally pancake house because the decor was horrible and dirty looking. We decided to still try it and the food was not good. I don't know how u really can mess up breakfast food that much but they managed.I had a friend in town that was looking for a unique bookstore, so I immediately thought of the Poisoned Pen. After realizing that the store did not carry what my friend was interested in we decided to check-out. 
I have been a resident of Arizona and Scottsdale for almost 20 years so I love to collect non-fiction books about my state and city.
While we were checking out I was greeted with a snickering comment by your "cashier/owner"....."Tourist"
Even if I WAS a tourist, I am giving my hard-earned dollars to local businesses such as yours...so what does it matter what I am buying?? You are getting your money either way.
I am embarrassed to have recommended your "shop" to my friend. And bad reviews get passed on 10X more than good reviews...WRINKLED

All i really want from a dry cleaners is a properly pressed shirt bc I firmly think ironing is a very tedious task.  They buy machines to make this very efficient and that's why we would pay $2 for one shirt.  So when the shirt comes back wrinkled, they are wasting my money AND time.  I really hate feeling cheated.

Please use this dry cleaners if you enjoy wasting your time.

Admittedly, I am in fact angry .. . .The WORST dry cleaners I have EVER been to!!!! They DESTROYED my wedding dress!! I can never get that back. I asked the girl there repeatedly if they had dealt with wedding gowns before, she assured me everything would be fine as they had cleaned wedding gowns before and they would take care of my special garment, I get it back and they said they could not clean it, but that they tried and through their attempts at cleaning my dress they stained my white floral details pink, they left their own rust stains or something along the bottom of the dress, they put a safety pin right through the garment leaving a hole and they destroyed all the clasps at the back so my dress no longer closes, I can't even store it correctly because of these people.
I cannot believe how much destruction they can do in just one day.
Then when I went to pick up my dry cleaning the next day they couldn't find all of it and made me late for an appointment waiting for them to try locate my duvet cover which I landed up leaving without as I just couldn't wait anymore, when I went to pick it up the next day there were rust stains ALL OVER IT!! So they kept it and cleaned it yet again, and when I went in to get it after their second attempt at cleaning it it still had stains all over it, so now I have to take it somewhere else.
I will NEVER EVER use this place again and I don't recommend that you take anything you care about here to be cleaned because this is the most destructive laundromat I have ever come across.
Seriously, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CLOTHING TO THEM!!!! I would give them negative stars if I could.I took my dress shirts and pants here in search of a more affordable dry cleaners. They ruined my favorite pair of slacks and did a poor job with my dress shirts. They are very cheap and I can see why.  Extremely poor quality...I will never go back.Was really excited to try a new Thai place in town, heard nothing but great things about this place. Received water as soon as we sat down, and then hadn't been acknowledged AT ALL, over 15 MINTUES we sat without service. A table that had been seated after us had already had their order taken and drinks received. After telling someone we were tired of waiting, we exited hungry and irritated. I'm in the industry too, I know how it goes! This was unacceptable! I'll stick to Phoenix for great food and great service. Sad we didn't even get to try the food!waste of money ask thai food got a chefs idea ... i guess i jus like mom and pops type of a place.... maybe i try it again but was really a high end place ... i order a soup and veggie rice and chicken basil .. the best thing was the rice liked the veggies . the other food was bad and i paid 50 for all of it ... should of went to subwayFirst off everyone knows you don't dry off a car in direct sun. This place has no covered area to finish wash/dry

They do not use air guns or even attempt to dry out door wells so you're guaranteed to have water spots dripping from every crevice.

Danny's charges $5 extra for hand wash, this place wants $35 to hand wash. 

Lastly for my $20 wash they did not dress my tires.  So either they forgot or don't do it - either scenario is crappy.  No excuses as I was the only car there, which may have been a harbinger of the poor car wash I got.Reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what I requested.  Called them and they simply told me that I ordered wrong.  I paid good money for something I could not eat.  Since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice Teryaki Lite...  Ok, no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway.  Tried to eat it... Chicken was dry as cardboard, and rice was a sticky mess.  Never again.

Save your money.Quite disappointed with my experience here.

I was looking for a specific item (a black/grey cell phone case which they had on their website) for a birthday gift for my girlfriend and because I work near by to Scottsdale Fashion Square, I figured I would check there to save on shipping/be more convenient for me.

They did not have the item in the store but offered to order it for me and I was told that it would take "3-5 days" to arrive to the store (which is where I asked for it to be sent due to the location of where I work).  Now I assumed that the 3 to 5 days were business days but seeing as I was ordering it on Saturday the 14th and didn't need it until Saturday the 21st, I figured that at the worst it would be there on the Friday which I explained all of this to the saleswoman before making the transaction.

After receiving no call by Friday afternoon, I put in a call to the store to ask what the status was and the saleswoman told me that it was scheduled to arrive the following Wednesday (the 25th).  Shocked, I explained the time frame that I was given when I ordered the case and the saleswoman stated that the time frame should have been 5-7 business days (which as it turns out, the 25th would still be 8 business days after it was ordered).  The saleswoman also tried to explain away the delay by saying that it may have been due to the holiday, to which I thought to myself "what holiday is in the middle of September?", and the saleswoman quickly followed the holiday explanation up with "I mean its only a Jewish holiday, but it may have caused a delay".  

This definitely shocked me (only a Jewish holiday?) but I proceeded to take the steps to see if my order could be taken care of in the time frame I was looking for.  She looked at other stores in the Valley but it wasn't there.

After hanging up with the sales woman, I was looking at the receipt and noticed that the original saleswoman had ORDERED THE WRONG COLOR.  Completely miffed at this point, I called back to check if the color I had asked for originally was at any of the stores and again the answer was no, and after discussing the incorrect order the saleswoman said that they could cancel the order and reorder in the correct color and have it one day shipped to the store.

Given the circumstance, I understand that they did what they could but why wouldn't you have just one day shipped the original order? That way when it was wrong, I would have known in time to make other arrangements.  Also, the sales staff may want to work a little bit more on listening to what the customer is asking for/ordering and not saying insensitive things like "only a Jewish holiday" because it will certainly be a long time before I go to this location (if ever) again.  

Stick to online shopping or only buying what you can walk out of the store with when it comes to this store.Absolutely the worst company to rent from. The AZ Regional Manager is rude and completely uncooperative. They just want your money and do not attempt to work with anybody. During our short stay at San Marcos, an Equity Residential community, we were bullied by the Property Manager. In February our garage flooded (because of rusty, neglected piping), and the Property Manager could not be contacted by myself, Scottsdale Fire Department, or the City of Scottsdale to shut off the water. After all of our things were destroyed, a San Marcos employee entered our garage, after it was agreed upon by management and myself that no one would enter or touch my property without my notification for insurance purposes. The employee did not only unlawfully enter the garage, but was touching my personal property. When he was confronted and told to leave, he retreated to the front office and called the police. The San Marcos employee attempted to file a false police report stating that he was physically harmed and was forcefully removed from the garage. No charges were filed because the peace officer could not find an evidence that the employee was harmed or telling the truth. This San Marcos employee entered the garage unlawfully, lied, and attempted to file a false police report. Throughout all of this the Property Manager and Equity Residential have been uncooperative, and demand $1300 to buyout of a lease that was violated by their own employee. My keepsakes and possessions have been ruined, the cops have been falsely involved, I have been continuously bullied by management, and now I am battling ridiculous fees and charges. DO NOT RENT FROM EQUITY RESIDENTIAL!Wow....reading these reviews is making me scratch my previously perfect-haired head and wondering what went wrong on my visit to Sassoon last week. 
It's like waking up in the morning and thinking "I didn't REALLY do that, did I"? and then going to the mirror and immediately getting that sinking feeling that I made a really bad mistake...except this one is going to show for months. 
I had been going to the Root and had perfect haircuts from Lauren, but had to cancel my appointment due to the Christmas rush and boy, do I regret it!
In addition, I saw a gal while I was eating at Zingburger and she had the perfect haircut and perfect style for me. Rather that ask her if I could take some quick pictures with my phone camera, I decided to "go to the source" of her great haircut and style and booked an appointment with Tobias at Sassoon. BIG MISTAKE!
My hair looks very choppy, and the sides are so thinned out that it feels like a good 50% of it is gone (onto the floor at Sassoon). The back is sorta cute but much shorter than I wanted and it doesn't blend at all with the sides. In fact, it looks like I have 3 haircuts plopped on my head and none of it makes sense. 
I had my Mom go with me and she just looked at it and said "the back is kind of cute" and my husband didn't say ANYTHING...until an hour later when he said "I told you to leave your hair alone for a couple of weeks...it looked great and now...."
I honestly think it was the worst haircut I've had in 30 years, and unfortunately, it cannot be "fixed" until it grows out (Hello! LIke in 3 MONTHS)...
This I will say, I like the vibe of the salon itself. And, everyone was very nice. However, as a previous client of Sassoon, I remember the days when EVERYONE walked out of the door looking like a million bucks with classic styles and precision cuts. I didn't view that this visit. 
A $92 haircut from the Sassoon's Assistant Salon Director should look a heck of a lot better than this...
My friends that have seen my haircut all say the same thing: it doens't blend, it is choppy and it'll grow...I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner, however that did not happen. 

First, half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came, then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table. 

Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks, this did not happen. 

Later, we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat, however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti, Chicken Cannelloni, Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells), she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner, someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates "without meat" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew, that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me, did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything. 

I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night, not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.Normally very happy with this place but came here for Mother's Day.  16 people. Made reservations using open table for 7:15. It's now 8:50 and still don't have food yet. Very unhappy. They obviously overbooked and couldn't handle it.Actually doesn't even deserve one star.  The whole time they asked if I wanted this and that extra.  I did give in and got $33 pedicure which includes callus remover.  I got home and my feet look exactly the same.  They also charged $3 for shiny buff which looks like CRAPPPPPPPP.  Oh and at the end my bill being $83 they tell me they need cash or check or I can use their ATM for $1 charge.  After a little while she then decides it is ok to use my card.  I am so disappointed with this place, especially taking my mom here for Mother's Day.  The one lady also had nerve to say that I should pay and I am rich.  WOW!!  Thankfully I am employed and am able to pay but cant imagine if I couldn't.  Anyway,  PLEASE PLEASE don't waste your time nor money here.  They can care less what your nails look like.I ordered a 16'' Pepperoni with extra cheese and 12 hot wings. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive and was only slightly warm when it arrived. The wings were a combination of overcooked and cold as well. The meat on the wings was tough and not very good and the sauce was the worst I have ever had (even Hungry Howie's sauce was better). The pizza was probably a 2/5 star pizza; it was standard greasy new york pizza, but thicker and without the flavor you would expect. It was also kind of tough, but it was not overcooked. The pepperoni topping was bland and tasteless -- I could've ordered cheese and it probably would taste the same.

All in all, this was the first time I have ordered from Streets of New York in probably a decade and I now remember why. It's more expensive (about 50%) than the alternatives and definitely is the worst I've ever had. 

Will not be buying again.Cockroach in my Kung Pao. 

I will never be eating there again.I have given them several taste attempts because they are close by,all yucky and the cashew chicken (missing the nuts-oh gee there was 6 I think maybe)- with vegetables was terrible.Not sure what they are fusioning? LOL The soup was bland and spring roles over cooked.The decor is cool. sushi is blah-The only thing I enjoyed is the white rice! I will not be going back... and we spent some bucks and wish we had not!I called to see how much it would be and how long it would take to have a pair of jeans hemmed about an inch from the bottom. The gentleman asked me "when do you need them by?" I said "I need them on saturday but I cannot drop them off until saturday." He proceeded to ask me if I thought the place was a fast food restaurant and had a VERY RUDE attitude. I have NEVER called an establishment who ONE treated me in this manner, and TWO answered the phone with..."HELLO?!" and no business name associated with it. I will never take my clothes here to be altered due to the RUDE phone call conversation. Someone needs to train their answering service how to speak to potential clients.Forgot my baby's meal, a member of my group order a jicama slaw and got red cabbage and onion. Half ass apology and paid for our fries. Other than that, tasty food, but not good enough.I really wanted to only give this restaurant a half star, but Yelp does not allow that. To begin, I don't even know how this place has 4 stars and falls under "Mexican food." I arrived at this place under the false pretense  that I could get some decent Mexican food. How wrong I was. First, I thought we would receive chips and salsa when the water came out, but I was wrong that would be at an additional $3. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with red sauce. While you would think this would be an easy ask it seemed to be very difficult to do. While the server was very nice in getting this done the burrito was HORRIBLE! The beans tasted as if they were thrown from the can to the stove for about 2 min and then out to us. The rice was crunchy and did not taste like regular spanish rice. Needless to say I will not be back for Mexican food.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself. 

Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took "the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I "get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world". Apparently my "myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, "[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it. 

I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.



***ADDITION 10/19/2010***
I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to "hold" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  "actual customers".*********** Used Another Groupon************

NOTHING has changed ........ However you'll love this

I viewed, a great encounter at the table next to us .......
One member in the party of 4, asked for the manager ......
He showed up, and the Lady asked if he knew So and So ........Yes, he did.
They chatted for a few minutes, and he left their table.

When, their meal was finished, he stopped again ..... and announced that dessert was ON THE HOUSE.
They had their desserts, and requested their check.

This group of 4, presented their $40 Groupon ..... for which they paid $20
AND ALSO presented a $25 D&C Happy Birthday email.

The Waitress of course, said you can redeem one ..... but not both, at the sametime.
Well, THIS BIG SHOT OF A CUSTOMER, asked for the same Manager, who had COMPED 4 desserts, again.

HE CAVED, and both certificates were applied towards the tab.

******If You Haven't Read My Previous Review ......... Its a "must read" *********

***Remember "Comping", doesn't improve the bottom-line,  UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR IT.***I agree with Alist R.'s review above.  I just got back from Prestige Carwash, the only reason why I went is for the coupons I get in the mail.  So I pull up and guy #1 is trying to sell me on this Express Carwash for $39, after 5 min of saying "no" to this guy, guy #2 tries to sell me on getting the cracks on my windshield filled in, that was another 5 min of saying "no".  The wash itself isn't that good.  It's NOT a hand car wash, they run your car through a drive through car wash and have some guys do a quick dry and run Armor-all on the dash while missing some spots.If less than one stat were poss 
the service was horrible, the wait...outrageous,.. the manager was so inappropriate to his employees in front of the public.. when i called to complain  he was a jerk and cared less about the service that was provided and satisfying the client
WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!  which is a shame, literally around the block from my house... if he would of made right by me, i would have been a loyal patron.  his/their lossI already wrote a review about this horrible place. Somehow it has disappeared. I took my van there to be washed. It has automatic doors. The yanked the door of the track and the door would not close. I ended up with a repair bill of $ 980. They denied that they had done it. It was closed when it went through the wash but would not close when I left. I pointed it out to them. They told me that they were insured for damage such as that. When they saw the repair bill they would not honour it. DO NOT DEAL WITH THES SHISTERS. IT IS NOT WORTH THE GRIEF THEY WILL CAUSEMan at the door with free samples was so rude. When my friend and I walked into and out of the store, he waved his basket of chocolate in our face but didn't offer us any samples. Staff inside was also not helpful or friendly.we went here late 2010 and had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon. the wait time was terrible and the entertainers were amateurish. we ordred appetizers and drinks and then our 2 entrees came. they came in small plates(lunch portions) . we complained and they said they split the dinner entree to make two. we complained but the manager wouldn't budge. well, we didn't either. we paid for our drinks and appetizers and left, but not before yelling out  "this place is a fraud !" i am of spanish descent and this place is a disgrace to my heritage.Atmosphere: old and run down, very loud flamenco dancing. Service: nothing special and she overcharged us by double. Still waiting on the manager to correct this mistake two months later. Food: meh. Bland, and waaaay overpriced. The mushroom appetizer has a nice sauce though.  We will definitely NOT be back.  I agree with the other commenters that this place needs an overhaul not more Groupons!  PS This review has been in my drafts for a while. Went to Pepin in the summer of '12.OMG. People need to wake up. Ra was good once. When it FIRST opened. Now that it is corporate and owned by Benihana it has turned into the Applebees of the sushi world. One thing I dont want a sushi restaurant to skimp on is the quality of fish. It has gone downhill. The Old Town location is the worst. How they get away with it with so much competition is nuts. Thank GOD the new Pure Sushi location just opened. It is in the Scottsdale Civic Center next to the Mondrian and AZ88. Beautiful, stylish place.  Google map that shit! The only sushi restaurant that should be more ashamed of themselves is Sushi Roku. But at least they are new and still workin out kinks. Anyway.. Happy New Year all!I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!They don't cook the fried rice in front of you.  The scallops are the sandiest I have ever tasted...almost not edible. The vegetables tasted like...vegetables...minus flavor. The soup was salty. The salad was...ok. There is nothing desireable about the teppanyaki experience. The sushi looked good. I won't ever know if it is because I have no desire to go back there. Since there are other restaurants that have amazing sushi...I won't be back. Last, the server, was sub par and didn't deserve the tip we gave her. Don't go here...there are so many restaurants that are better in Scottsdale.I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today.
I don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from).
But, jeez, I was embarrassed today!
I remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset "old-timers" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for "early bird specials"? I don't know.
I got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here.
It went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited.
I just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L). 
He took our orders and we waited...and waited.
My fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by "right out" he meant 4 minutes from now).
This might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse.
The fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish.
The mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign.
You know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together. 
But it was a successful lunch in the business sense.
I try to "vote local" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today.
Jeez...this was embarrassing!I recently visited Frank & Lupes in Old Town Scottsdale for a dinner with friends, and was very disappointed with the experience.  During the evening, our service was quite slow and erratic.  Our party was charged for small servings of chips and salsa, which they brought to our table before we ordered anything.  Some in our party were surprisingly charged for premium alcohol even though they ordered house/well quality.  Even worse, the salsa we were served was watery and of overall poor quality.  We had friends at another table, and they echoed the same sentiments.  

I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again!!  All diners are forewarned!!Overpriced and overrated. Bathroom situation horrible. It takes at least 10 minutes to walk to the restroom if your seated in the front room and then you gotta get real lucky scoring one of one stall bathrooms to actually do what you gotta do. Moving onto the food, there are no lunch specials available, so you must select off the high priced dinner/lunch menu. Whoever is saying that this salsa is good is clearly off their rocker. It is a watery mess with nothing in the salsa. It is more like a bowl of Frank's red Hot Sauce than a true salsa experience. Chips though were tasty and seemed homemade, but doubt it now. Our lunch choices were the Chicken Mole and one of those tortilla shell salads from the 80's. Her dish was quite standard and I heard no complaints, but my mole had some issues. Smartass waiter said this wasn't a hot item and mole typically isn't, but 1/4 of the way through, this gringo started heavy sweating. Then we have the chicken which did not seem like real chicken. Plus the dish was chicken mole enchiladads, but all they did was give me two cheese enchiladas with some nasty chicken on top and then that horrible mole sauce at a price of almost 12 bucks. 
   Frank and Lupe's time has come and gone. How bout remodeling your cramped front room and modernizing your bathroom facilities while your at it. Scottsdale garbage.Wow...truly awful service & food...went around 3PM place was not busy yet service was really poor...Margarita too sweet...Michelada was off-tasting as well.  Nothing remotely authentic about food & really poor example of the great Mexican food we have in the Valley!Where to start, let's just saw Awful!!!!!  Service was ok, waiter was pleasant.  Ordered the angel hair with chicken, it showed up almost 10 minutes after every one else was served, and when it did, the pasta was almost RAW... How do you screw up angel pasta, well they did.  Another in our party had the eggplant parm.  They should call it no eggplant pram...barely any eggplant...overall, ever rated, over priced, and just not very good....We too never got an opportunity to eat here.  After waiting at the door behind a party of 4 for about 5 minutes with no host or hostess I asked the party in front of us how long the wait was.  They said they did not know but had been waiting there for 10 mintues waiting to be greeted.  

I decided to walk into the restaurant and look for some help.  I spotted a server and smiled and asked what the wait time was explaining that no one was there to greet us.  He looked as though he was going to help and started walking towards me and then past me and said they were busy.  No sorry someone will be right with you we are a little busy.  Just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude.  

I walked right back to our party of four and said this place is rude let's get out of here.  We went to Bucca Di Beppo across the way and were greeted with big smiles and open arms.  The staff was amazing!  Shaken by my experience with the rude waiter I asked our waiter at Bucca to provide me with a duplicate receipt of our dinner bill.  

I took the receipt back to Italian Grotto and wanted to speak to a manager explaining how they lost the business due to a rude waiter.  Well I never showed the receipt because again there was no host in the lobby so I proceed to walk into the restuarant to find the manager.  I was stopped by a halfbaked and drunk man with an empty bottle of wine in his hand in a gray shirt with gray hair and two diamond earrings in his ear.  He approached me and said you looking for someone.  I replied yes the owner or manager please.  He stood there and acted as though he were the person.  I asked are you the owner?  He said why are you asking me questions? I never asked you questions?  I turned to my friend and said they cannot be the owner.  I again asked and got the same response.  

He ordered us out of the dining room and told us to talk to him on the tile area considered their tiny lobby.  I walked back and he was beligerent and drunk and proceeded to tell me that I was the rudest person he ever met.  

Complete whackjob!  I agree that friends have to be writing these positive reviews.  Dick's Last Resort known to be rude on purpose posed as angels to this place.Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner/server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at  your own risk.Just left the place, at home now waiting for a pizza as we left this place in disgust! Not only are we disgusted at the NASTY BUG! (see the last picture) in my friends salad but also at the attitude server Henry gave us as we pointed this out to him. He insisted in a rude manner that this was an anchovie. I'm pretty sure anchovies don't have legs and wings and look like a freaking BUG. I know he didn't want to make a scene for the parties around us, so he tried to make us look stupid. Well sorry Henry, the only stupid one here is you, especially for telling us to "just leave" after you failed to accept this mistake. That's the worst thing you can do to your costumers who have frequented this place. HORRID!

we figure this place stays busy and open because of its amazing location. that's all it has going for it.This place made my stomach flip! The owner was rude and assumed that we did not speak English because our skin was brown. I have never felt more offended in my life.  And then he acted like he was giving us complimentary glasses of wine and appetizers to redeem himself as a "New Yorker" and charges us    The place is way overpriced and nothing special.  Move on now !!!! We had an app and a glass of overpriced wine and decided to leave because of the offensiveness.   Disgusted by what an owner representsLet me just say there is nothing worse than when a relationship goes sideways.  I've been coming here for years, as I have a small watch collection and always come here for my batteries.  Their 5-year warranty is a super deal...but then, this evening, it all went terribly, terribly wrong.

Three weeks ago, I brought in one of my watches thinking it just needed a battery.  They told me it needed a new mechanism.  It would cost $185; they would have to send it out; and I wouldn't get it back for six weeks.  Although I was pretty bummed, there didn't seem to be much choice.  

So I paid the $185 for the watch and settled in for a long wait.  Two weeks later, they called to say the watch was done, which would seem like extra special good service.

When I went in to get the watch, the young man immediately noticed a problem.  The watch didn't have the proper time.  He gave the watch to the watch guy who fiddled with it for a few minutes.  When the watch guy came out, he told me the hand was just getting a little stuck, and it should be fine now.  I put the watch on my wrist and left.

About an hour later I looked at my watch, and it was on the exact time it had been when I picked it up.  It never actually worked.  And then I got to thinking about it:  Initially they said they would have to send it out and it would take six weeks.  So, why was it done in two?  I would be willing to place a large bet it's because they decided they could make a few bucks by doing it themselves and not "sending it out."  Do I think my watch got a new mechanism?  Well, I am planning to send it back to the maker, and I guess they can tell me the answer to that.

When I went in to talk to them about it, there was only a young man and the jeweler working (neither the manager nor the watch guy was there).  I explained everything to the young man and said, "You know, at this point, I just want you to refund my money, and I'll send it back to the maker."  He said, "Well that's not going to happen."  What exactly did he think my reaction to that statement would be?  Maybe he could have tried, "You know, I don't have the authority to make that decision.  I'll need to have you speak to the manager."  That would have made sense.  But NO!  Nick, as it turns out he is called, thought it would be a good idea to call the shot on this.  After I became fairly upset, THEN, Nick decides to say, "Well that would be up to the manager."  No kidding, Nick.  

If this had been the totality of the problem, the relationship might have been salvageable. Sadly, that's not the case.  When I picked up the watch initially, before I knew there was a problem, I also brought in an earring I wanted reconfigured so that the two stones in one earring would make two separate earrings.  The jeweler came out, looked at it, and said it would be no problem.  He would just add a new jump ring to each stone and they would be done in an hour.  It would be $24.95.  Remember:  a new jump ring.  That's it.  Not a new bezel.  Not a new ANYTHING else.  A new freaking jump ring. 

On the same night I went in to discuss the problem with the watch, I also needed to pick up these earrings.  And what to my wondering eye did I behold?  A bill for $24.95 TIMES TWO.  I said, "Oh, that's a mistake, it's one pair of earrings.  The man quoted me $24.95."  The jeweler who I dealt with came out and said, "No, I meant $24.95 EACH."  And then Nick, who WAS NOT THERE when the quote was given, decides he's going to weigh in.  "Oh, yes.  That was per earring."  Okay, Nick, now you and I have some real issues.  But seriously, when he said $24.95 was I supposed to know that was $24.95 to put a tiny jump ring on EACH stone?  I asked if the price on the earrings in the case was for one or both?  Have you ever charged PER EARRING?  Earrings are a set.  If they sold mittens, would they charge per mitten.  Socks?  Shoes?  Shoelaces? Earplugs?  

Okay, so now I'm pretty worked up.  I was going to let them keep the watch and have the manager call me tomorrow.  However, at this point I told them to take a long look at their computer and consider how much money I had spent there.  Yes, they agreed.  I had spent a lot of money there.  Well, I said, "that $185 for not fixing this watch.  And the $53.04 for the $24.95 jump ring on the earrings is the last money you will ever see from me."

Maybe Nick and his manager will have a nice chat about this.  But, my guess is, probably not.  So, since this site is all about helping other people out, let me just say, the young lady in front of me was getting an explanation about why the engraving on the back of her watch was crooked.  Yes, they were justifying it.  Crooked engraving!    

If you need something besides watch repair, engraving or a simple jewelry repair... oh forget it, I still would NEVER recommend this place.This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.Horrible service!  It took them forever to answer the phone so I could place my To Go order.  When I took my food order home, it was incorrect.  So I called the restaurant only to be put on hold for 15min, with employees picking up the line on occasion to ask me to hold longer.  When I asked for the manager I was hung up on.  After another 5min. wait back on hold, I was finally able to speak to the manager.  He was nice enough to refund the price of the entree that was incorrect, however, I would still not recommend this location.  I have been to other Pei Wei locations in the Valley with much better service.Very disappointing.  We chose the Pinion Grill for a special occasion.  Very nice view but very slow service and unacceptable food.  We both chose the rib eye steak which was a huge mistake.  It was very thin and tough. The waiter apologized for the slow service and comped one of the steaks, but both the venue and the food choices were a mistake.What a snobby rude place. It was like the movie pretty woman. Me and my friends walked in dressed nicely, but I guess not Scottsdale nice. The woman immediately judged us and when my friend, the bride to be, pointed out a dress she liked, the woman had the nerve to say it was out of her price range! My friend never mentioned a price range and in fact, she could have afforded if she wanted to. She had $5,000 set aside for her wedding dress. Yes the dress was on the expensive side, just slightly over $5,000, but who is this woman to tell my friend she can't afford it. The whole shop seemed cold and uninviting. I would recommend you stay away from this place. In fact, there is a store right around the corner called Lillian Lotties and that place is wonderful. They are inviting and so nice and helpful and will definitely not judge you. I recommended you go spend your money there instead. You will spend half the money. Destiny's Brides prices were extremely high. If you don't mind lower customer service and don't mind paying at least $5,000 (and that's one of the cheapest prices), then maybe this place is for you. They did have a decent amount of dresses and the only other nice thing about this place is that you can also get the groom's tuxes there, so it is a one stop shop for the wedding party.We went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.I never shop at AJ's. That being said I have stopped into the Baseline & Val Vista location for the salad bar, coffee, and sushi and have always been really pleased.

I made a trip to this AJ's to obtain some specialty items for my husbands upcoming birthday dinner I was preparing. He requested prime rib and I am NOT into meat nor do I know anything about certain types, cuts, etc. of meat. Knowing I was heading to a "fine foods" store though I was comfortable with the expectation someone who works in the meat department would be extremely knowledgeable and help me with my purchase. I was absolutely wrong. The two gentleman working the meat counter had less meat knowledge than I did. They did not know a single thing about prime rib including if they even sell it there nor were they offering to find someone else in the store who did. 

I also wanted to pick up some sweet sparkling red wine as a celebratory after dinner treat. I asked the head of the wine department to help me and he pointed me to two different bottles stating they were both very sweet. I purchased the sparkling Syrah (against my better judgment thinking the entire time in my mind that syrah is not a sweet varietal, but reassuring myself this guy does this for a living and what do I actually know about sparkling red wine) which as it turns out, was NOT sweet at ALL. 

I headed over to the bakery for some carrot cake, again at the request of my husband, and was confident having read so many reviews raving over their cake I would find something insanely delicious. They have two different carrot cakes, one from a third party and one they make in house. The girl working in the bakery actually recommended the third party offering that "it's better than ours and the pieces are bigger" Again, trusting the employee's advice I purchased two pieces. 
It was the most disgusting piece of carrot cake I have ever ate. The frosting tasted more like old sour cream than frosting making the whole HUGE piece basically inedible. 

Very disheartening experience. I recovered by heading to Whole Foods (on Mayo) were I absolutely can always count on all of the employees being so helpful and insanely knowledgeable. There was no prime rub displayed here either but of course the meat man went in the back and cut a piece especially for me offering lots of advice on cooking, seasoning etc. I was so upset at myself for ever doubting that my beloved Whole Foods could not handle the "fine foods" dinner I wished to prepare.This place has VERY BAD customer service !!!!! Only positive thing is the food is good. I don't understand why businesses treat their customers that way for delivery.Why do stores like this exist? Does anyone in Arizona really need more brightly colored, tacky tchotchkes? It looks like Elton John threw up in here and then Liberace tried to cover it up by bedazzling everything.Not real sure how this place decides what to take or not take, but today I stopped in with a bunch of clothes which were worth more than $5,000 and they did not want to consign anything.  They said it is not something they want and it was outdated.  I did not think leather jackets, hand made leather boots, Anne Klein cashmere sweaters and tailor made jackets and tops ever go out of style.  An older woman came in after me with a bunch of bright colored sweaters and they took everything she had.  Go figure, some people just do not know good quality if it bit them in their....you know what.One of the worst customer service and BAD ATTITUDES I've ever experienced.  The owner is very UNFRIENDLY.  He treats you as if you have wandered uninvited into his shop.  I asked for a Joseph Phelp wine and his reply was "why would I have that here?!"  I is as if he didn't want any business or customers at all.  The wine selection is average and over-priced.  THE ARE HUNDREDS OF BETTER WINE STORES nearby.I have eaten at several California Pizza Kitchen locations around the country.  Anytime I see one, I go because it seems relatively consistent and reliable. My experience a few nights ago at this location, though, was absolutely disappointing.  When we first sat down, I ordered a glass of water and a full glass of their house Pinot Noir.  The water never came, and our spunky little waitress returned with a glass of white wine.  Confused, I politely asked for a glass of Pinot Noir again, and specified that it was a red wine.  She argued and said, "No, you ordered Pinot Grigio, so here." So, I drank it anyways because I am not the arguing type.  When it came time to order, we ordered spinach dip as an appetizer, and my friend and I split a full-size BBQ chicken salad and a mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza on a thin crust for our entrees. Considering this is three of, what I assume to be, their most popular items, I expected the exceptional quality of food I usually receive there.  The spinach dip, which was cold, came out at the same time as the salad and pizza. The pizza wasn't on a thin crust. The waitress never returned to ask for refills or anything, so we had to flag down another waiter for our bill. All in all, disappointing.EXTREMELY disappointed with this CPK. I used to love the chicken ceaser sandwich. Even though they discontinued the sandwich I called in to see if they could still make it on different bread. When I called in, the lady that picked up said they could make it on a ciabatta bread. I then drove 15 minuets to enjoy this meal, and when I got there they proceed to tell me that there is no way that they could make the sandwich. NEVER GOING BACKI was so displeased on Valentine's Day with both my food and service. I have lived in the valley for years and always wanted to dine at Elements. Normally on special occasions or when we are in the mood to treat ourselves we have our usual spots; Mastros, Flemings, Donovans... If you couldn't tell we enjoy a nice steak, but this year we decided to mix it up and give Elements a shot and were very excited to finally check this place out. 

The view did not disappoint. Megan, one of the managers was very pleasant when accommodating our reservation. Another one of the managers was also very pleasant who sat us, but I do not recall his name... Unfortunately, that is where the pleasantries stopped.

Our server came across rude and uninterested. This could have been because of the prix fixe menu or maybe he was just having an off night but our drinks were always left empty, we rarely saw him, he came across very snarky and even sarcastic at times. 

I was also unimpressed with the food/menu for the evening. Out of our table of 4 the only thing anyone enjoyed was the bacon wrapped shrimp. The majority of us ordered the short ribs and not one person was impressed. The salads were ok, the desserts lacked flavor, and the presentation could have been better.

For a dinner totaling $600 for 4 people who barely drank ( I think 3  beers and 3 cocktails for the whole table) I left feeling like I had almost been taken advantage of. I feel like Elements rested on their reputation and truly did not make the extra effort in service or cuisine that has awarded them their stellar reputation. As a business owner I understand you can't be perfect 100% of the time but this was a definite disappointment and I felt my experience warranted the lowest possible rating. Hopefully, one day we can give them another shot on a non holiday, non prix fixe menu and I can change my opinion but as of now they or 0 for 1.The store is clean.  This is the worst pharmacy I have ever used.  The pharmacy just down the street at Scottsdale Rd & Shea is the one to use.  Every time I have gone to this pharmacy the service has been terrible.  I have had to wait at the drive thru for 20 minutes just with me already at the window.  90% of the time they do not have the medication in and have to order it.  The people at the pharmacy are not helpful and seem overworked..I read a lot of great reviews so we tried it. I was not impressed.

This is definitely an older crowd (50+) and it seems they cater to that crowd. The food was small portions for the high cost, and the flavors were not all that great. The sweet breads were chopped up and drowned in sauce so you could barely taste the breads. I did not even think they were what we ordered.

I would not spend my money here, especially at their prices.Been a resident here for 14 months. New ownership right after I signed 2nd year lease in July. First I should point out at renewal the agent in the office quoted us a rate. When we came to sign the paperwork the next day, price was $70 a month higher. The woman working said he must have misquoted us. I fought with corporate office for 3 days to get then to honor the quote he gave. Since that time service has dropped to horrible levels. Shower head broke off - 3 days to replace. Sink faucet knob broke in half. Guy looked at it & told me he had a knob for it but needed to go to storage room to get it. Said he'd be back in 10 minutes. Never returned. 3 days later it was replaced after I had to contact the office about it again twice. The excuse? Only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Now, our washing machine is broken. It overflowed a week ago & flooded our hall. Went to office to let them know & she said she would send maintenance right over. Never came. Contacted them again next day & excuse was, again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Guy came and shop vacuumed water but was still another day to look at washer. Got a call from manager that it's fixed. Yay right? Wrong! So it isn't overflowing now. It just doesn't spin out or refill for rinse cycle. Doh! Went to office again. Will have someone look at it "tomorrow". Tomorrow came & no one came so I called office an hour before closing (it was Friday). Excuse? Again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. And no one will be here over the weekend so she'll have him come Monday. Not to be a dick, but them having only 1 maintenance guy is their problem, not mine. a week and still no washer? how about pulling a working one from an empty apartment for a quick fix? Or at least a credit to my rent for having to go to a laundromat 2 weeks in a row? Creative solutions & customer service people! But there is neither, just excuses. Hence this review recommending you STAY AWAY from this property.They are changing their complex name to Mosaic, so be forewarned the issues will exist there, too.

I am sick of this. The water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. The first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now I wake up and there is no water and I can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work!

Also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. They also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and I come home from work after it is dark. Since I come home after dark, I notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently.

The new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. You can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late.To call this hotel a 5 star resort is like describing the Reno Aces as a major league baseball team. If you're expecting the customer service, amenities and quality of a typical JW Marriott hotel, this is not the spot for you. The rooms are old and smelly (my guess is that the rooms haven't been renovated in over 20 years), the service is juvenile and the food is subpar. Although the area and the surroundings are beautiful, there are many other hotels in Paradise Valley that are encompassed by the beautiful Arizona mountains. If you stay here, you'll be paying JW Marriott prices but you won't be getting the quality.Six of us went to dinner on Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday. When we entered the restaurant we did notice that there were two very large groups in side rooms. We were seated at the far end of the dining room where it was nice & quiet. Our waitress arrived promptly but was extremely harried & had difficulty staying focused on us long enough to take our order. The drinks arrived quickly and that was the last good thing that occurred in the entire evening. The salads took about an hour to be served. When she brought the salads we asked the waitress about our meals and she said that perhaps she should put our order in. We had to ask for bread & butter. At this point we called the manager over to complain & suggested that a complimentary round of drinks might be appropriate. His response was that he did not have the authority to do that. Another 45 minutes brought us our dinners. Unfortunately, they were inedible. The sauce for the sand dabs (which were way too large to really be sand dabs) had been sitting for so long that it had completely congealed. It did not pour even when you turned the gravy boat upside down; the same with the sauce on the chicken piccatta. One of the meals was so overcooked it had to be sent back. The manager was once again called for & he saw to the food being sent back to the kitchen. When the food came back it was barely edible but we still had not been served any of our side dishes & the dish that was overcooked had not been replaced. Ten minutes later side dishes started to arrive, not the ones that we ordered but whatever the kitchen had sitting around. This whole horrible evening had started at 6:30 pm. At 9 pm we got up from the table having never really had our dinner. The waitress came running over with our bill. Our response was that we had never eaten dinner & should not have to pay for it. Once again we got to talk to the manager. Instead of trying to make us happy & inviting us to come back and give them another chance to make things right, he accepted the fact that we would not pay & let us walk out the door. The six of us went out for yogurt because we were really very hungry. It was certainly not how we planned on celebrating our friend's birthday.Went with another couple with Groupon. Sat in the bar since there was no one in the dining room and there was a piano player in the bar. The bar was about 1/3 full of very old "cougars". Two waitresses who thought they were slammed with business. We waited 30 minutes to get waited on and finally ordered our own drinks and dinner from the bartender.  Food was average and the wait staff was HORRIBLE! Will NEVER go there again.disappointment supreme!  dated empty dining room should have been the first clue.. extremely overpriced and poor quality food.. the only consistent factors was bad food and poor service.. with the great choices in Scottsdale there is no reason to consider Remington's.. even with a Groupon the meal was extremely overpriced... be smart, stay far away..While eating in the restaurant, I saw one of their employees yell at two customers (who looked to me like professional women) and refused to sell them the cake they had picked out.  I called to report this to a manager, and it turns out it was the owner who had thrown them out.  She said they had made a rude comment about her to an employee, but I didn't see that, just her coming out from the back with the cake, refusing to write on it or sell it to them.  She told them she didn't need their business.  Very strange!Where do I begin...this is a compilation of my last three visits to RCSH and my experiences were all the same.  Why go back?  I was given a number of gift cards over the last couple years and used each one.  I now ask that I NOT be given anything to do with this restaurant..  Here are the reasons:

1.  Confirmed reservations were ignored or not honored.  The final visit resulted in an hour wait.  Yea that was a great anniversary visit waiting at the bar.
2.  The staff is uniformly ignorant about customer service.  Is it so hard to take less than 30 minutes to come and take the order?  Can you come back sometime again during the meal?  Why do I wait another half hour to be asked if I want coffee and dessert once my plate is removed? Does each visit really have to take 2 and a half hours? I exempt the bus staff as they tried.
3.  The food is ordinary...no comparison to The Capital Grille or others.
4.  Each and every time we had such bad service we were given free desserts.  They clearly understood that our experience was bad.

Please FIX 1, 2,& 3 above.  I don't care about the dessert if the rest of my experience is so awful.

After the last time I have stopped going and will not be back.  There are other places that give you great value for your time and money so take the opportunity and go elsewhere.  Scottsdale has Atlas Bistro and Monarch Cafe that can rock your socks off.We booked the Hermosa Hideaway package with a King bed for New Year's Eve 2007. Our troubles began upon check in. We checked in and were shown to our room and were immediately surprised and upset to find a Queen sized bed and no fireplace. A week prior to our stay, we specifically emailed the hotel to inquire about fireplaces. We received a timely response ensuring us that ALL rooms at The Hermosa Inn had fireplaces. We immediately voiced our concerns to the front desk, and we were given the option of changing to what we believe is a "Rancho" room. This one did have a King bed and fireplace, but we had to move our belongings ourselves across the property. 

The second room was better, but it was annoying and inconvenient to change rooms at a hotel when paying $400+ a night. It should have been correct the first time. Furthermore, someone at this hotel is incompetent if they are informing guests that all rooms have fireplaces when that is clearly not the case. Two other small details that were unacceptable given the price: the remote control for the main room's TV in the initial room did not work. Secondly, the chocolate strawberries that we were presented were pretty nonchalantly thrown on a plate. Again, not that big of a deal, but for the price, the presentation should have been exemplary.
 
We settled into our new room and enjoyed our champagne. Around 6:00pm we both became hungry, and we inquired as to what options were available. We asked about room service and/or appetizers in the bar. We were informed that no such food was available; because it was New Year's Eve, there was not room service and the dining room was only fixing the fixed menu meal. We understand that New Year's Eve is a holiday, but such a holiday should not incapacitate and overwhelm the kitchen to the point that no other food is available. What if we hadn't planned on eating in the restaurant that night? It's not like it is mandatory for guests to dine at Lon's. It was 6:00pm and we had 9:30pm dinner reservations since that is all that was available. We were hungry and had been drinking champagne, so leaving the property was not an option. No one thought to offer us even bread, which was clearly available since it was served at dinner. We then called back a second time to find out if the restaurant might be able to figure something out if we were sitting in the bar, and the person on the phone was very rude and hurried and said that if we came to the bar that "someone might be able to figure something out for you" but they were very "busy" at the moment. This is really atrocious at a hotel that calls itself "a luxury boutique." When we returned from dinner we had not gotten turn down service (it is the principle of this fact that bugs us). No one had removed the leaky champagne bucket either.

Our poor stay wrapped up in the morning when we went to check out and perhaps get breakfast. There was one guest complaining about something when we arrived in the lobby, so the person at the front desk left to try to find the maintenance person and help that guest. The front desk then stayed unattended for 10 minutes (while the phone rang off the hook and others of us waited patiently). The maintenance person finally appeared and proceeded to get into a "discussion" with the person at the front desk while we were checking out - this totally interrupted us paying our HUGE bill and was unprofessional to say the least.  We couldn't believe that the front desk person and maintenance person would carry on that unprofessionally and tactlessly while guests waited in the lobby. Before we left, we asked if breakfast was available (which had been advertised and promoted in our package), and we were informed that "if you go in there right now they will probably still be able to help you." We were miffed that we "might" get helped for breakfast at 10:00am when it was supposedly included in our package.

Overall, the main issue with The Hermosa Inn (and Lon's) is that it is way overpriced for the service offered. Our bill wasn't even adjusted for the cheaper room we ultimately stayed in. We spent more at The Hermosa Inn in less than 24 hours than we spent in 2 nights at a luxury hotel on Vancouver Island with all 3 meals included. The service there was amazing, impeccable and attentive and set the standard for what luxury means. Luxury does not mean telling guests that all rooms have fireplaces when they do not. Luxury does not mean telling guests that no food is available until dinner at 9:30pm. Luxury does not mean leaving the front desk unattended. Luxury certainly does not mean maintenance people and front desk people arguing in front of guests, and luxury does not mean telling guests that breakfast "might" be available if they hurry. 

A traveler has not had a good experience at your property if they wished they would have just stayed home for the night. The property is quaint and pretty, though, so it has much potential.Terrible.  My wife and I went there early afternoon on Thursday.

First, the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:

"Are you together?"

Well duh, it's 2010.  Two wedding bands, my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me, somewhere in N. Africa, but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a couple.

Next, the food was miserable.

I had an "Orange Peel Beef" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky, fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it.  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish.   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer.  

Again, I ask myself, why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in Arizona?

My wife, or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed, ordered some chicken dish.

Again, over-breaded, had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white rice.

This was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch.  

Literally, my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home.  Three of three strikes, shame on us for giving it another shot.

Pei Wei was awesome about three years ago, but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks.  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend "food stand-down" and retraining of the chef's.

I was HEAVILY disappointed.  Again.Absolutely, without a doubt the WORST bank I've visited in AZ. The people at this branch are incredibly rude as well as just not caring at all. I was attempting a deposit of all things. Don't waste your time with this branch and after this experience, US Bank will get NONE of my money.

Even their company website customer reviews for this branch are 2.5 out of 5!I feel like several other patients have already expressed that Dr.Klag is great, but his office people leave alot to be desired and that's putting it mildly.
 In june i was given a phone call telling me that i needed a CT scan right away. I informed the office person that i  was in their in february and Dr. Klag stated that he did not have to see me anymore and everything was fine.They kept insisting and calling me so i went and had the test which my insurance wouldn't cover.The result was when i went for the review with Dr.Klag of which he was 2 hours late for; when he walked in he apologized and asked why i was there.He stated that he had not ordered the test.So i payed $250 for a test i didn't need not to mention radiation.
Now the story gets better because i decided to call billing because i thought why should i pay for a visit that i didn't need along with all the other factors.For three weeks i tried to speak to someone in billing and left messages for the Director of billing some director she would not return a call,her name is Linda Ellis.I own an Employment Company so i can say with authority this is one employee that should be fired pronto and does Dr.Klag a huge disservice.
 At this point its not the $65 for the visit it"s the whole idea that they don't know what they are doing and really don't care.There are alot of people out of work and i am sure someone else would appreciate those positions and do their job with pride.To put it shortly, rude employees, overpriced items, and misleading signs.

My parents are new to the Scottsdale area - we're originally from California - and since my siblings and I are visiting for the holiday season we decided to decorate a cactus. My dad and I drove over to read their sign declaring, "Open from 8am to 4pm everyday."

"Everyday," it seems, except the days they don't feel like it. We showed up around 2:50, hopped out of the car, and started looking at the cactuses. First of all, they were quite expensive. Definitely not in our budget and, according to my parents who have now lived here for a couple months, more pricey than they've seen other places.

We'd been out of the car, and surprised by the prices, for barely a minute when an employee comes rushing over, declaring (quite rudely, I might add) that they were closed. We pointed that the sign said they were open until four, and the employee gave us a vague answer, "you know, with the rain, and uh, Christmas... Anyway, we're closed so... But we'll be open at 8am sharp tomorrow!"

Admittedly, it had been raining - but about an hour earlier! It was still a little cloudy but with no signs of future rain. And if Christmas was the reason they were closing, then why be open tomorrow?

Quick side note, this is not the first time I've gone somewhere in this area only to see they have close well before the time they claim they would. Maybe it's the norm here? Still, how can people expect to get business if they're closed?

Sir, you may be there at "8am sharp" tomorrow, but we certainly won't be. Or ever again.There's never anybody at checkout....the employees  always seem to be in a rap session in the manager's office. Deli is a ghost town. No self check out. For some reason there's a Starbucks inside even though there's one right across the parking lot.WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! If you don't like serving guests upstairs, please don't seat us up there. I eat out every day and I've never seen such lazy, careless service in my life. To start, It took 15 minutes to get greeted. When we finally did get greeted, it was by a rude server who seemed annoyed we were there. His first words to us were "are you ready?" That set the tone for the rest of the dinner. He went downstairs and came back up to check on us one time. The bartender working up there ignored us, we never even got refills on our drinks, and we had to go up to her to get our bill, even though all she was doing was just standing behind the bar doing nothing. The food was good, and they were playing Monday night raw on the tv upstairs which was the only reason they are getting one star from us. Your food is good, now please fix your service!Ordered #35 on the menu. Extremely disappointed. Four pieces of hard lamb... and 95% of the dish Jasmine rice. Very blah. Will never come back.I wouldn't recommend this place. The bar hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. The coolers are disgusting. This was a terrible experience! If I was an owner I'd be appalled at the condition this place is in.  Absolutely disgusting. I should submit the photos I took to the health board. Filthy establishment.This place single handedly took the cake for Worlds Worst Chinese Buffet! Soon as I walked in at 3pm the people seemed sort of rude. I was so hungry  I didnt care. The workers were constantly evening out the serving pans almost immediately after I took a portion out. They never once added new food, they just kept smoothing out food piles to make it look like it was freshly put out. They charged me $11 which thought was high.   Everything at the Buffet was just awful. Half cold rice, the beef and brocoli was so over cooked it disentigrated soon as i took a bite. I tried probably 12 different items and was laughing at how miserable the meal was. My advice RUN!This place is horrible. The only time this place might be satisfying is if I were completely stoned. 

The sushi was worse than the stuff you buy from the grocery store.

The orange chicken was watery.

The teriyaki was dry.

There is nothing that would ever get me to come back to this place.If these guys are providing a service, it's to themselves to make a profit and not to it's customers to provide an honest service.  I am by no means an experienced professional mechanic, but I do have plenty of experience repairing my own vehicles and I know the difference between a necessary and unnecessary repair.  I took my car into their shop just to have my front disk break pads replaced, which by their advertised special would have been under $100. They called me to say that the master cylinder was leaking and unsafe so needed to be repaired, an extra $450, and they refused to do the job without repairing that as well. I called their bull#### and did the pads myself. 60k miles later I'm still driving and haven't added a drop of break fluid to the reservoir. I've bad plenty of used cars and know things like that just don't need to be done. Don't get ripped off! Stay away from these cons!If I could give them zero stars, I would.

In June, LA Fitness withdrew my monthly fee FIVE TIMES. That's correct: they charged me my monthly dues FIVE TIMES within 30 days. it was never reimbursed.

It only gets worse.

Around the same time, I moved out of the area, and called to cancel my membership. They told me it had to be done online. I went online and it was literally impossible to cancel that way. For fear that they would continue to withdraw money, I cancelled my debit card and got a new one.

The harassment begins.

I'm not exaggerating: every week, once or twice a week, I received a call from one of their many call centers around the country, calling to tell me that there is a "problem with my credit card" and that I owe them money. The first call, I explained that no, I do NOT owe them money; that in fact THEY owe ME money, and that I would like to cancel my membership immediately. I was told that I have to do it online. I told them that this was not possible. They told me they'd "note my account".

At least A DOZEN more calls followed over the next four month (FOUR MONTHS!), all "informing" me that I "owe them money", then me stating that I want to f***ing cancel, then them saying to go online, then me saying - even asking to walk me through it and being told they don't know how!!! - that's not an option, then them saying they'd "note my account".....

Then there was today. Yet another call. Broken record, I'm getting fed up and I threatened to contact the Better Business Bureau (which I will do next). I ask if she can read English, as there MUST be something "noted on my account", yes? No. Nothing. NOTHING. Which leads me to believe that these assholes were just trying to get more money from me.

The most frustrating part: she literally cancelled my account over the phone in about 15 seconds. (I assume. I received an immediate email confirmation.) Absolutely no reason for those assholes to harass me for 4 months.

Oh, the kicker: the email said I still owe them $79. Fact is, technically they owe me over $100, but I'm willing to take the loss to get these assholes out of my life.

DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT give this company your credit card info...which is the only way to join...so, FIND ANOTHER GYM. 

I realize that my complaint is corporate's issue, and not Scottsdale's, but there is no where else to Yelp this and Scottsdale is where I signed up.Bought a new Volvo from Volvo of Tempe and the sales portion of things was good. Now the Service Department is the opposite of good. Had an appointment at 2 but didn't get started until 3, minor thing but that meant the rest of the day was shot. Had to get some parts replaced but it turned out that they had ordered the wrong parts, how is that possible I bought the car from you and you have the VIN in your system?

Then when we had an insurance claim we wanted to have the repairs done by a "Volvo Authorized Body Shop" which they had a plaque on the wall for, but they refused to meet the industry standard rates as they cost $72 / hr more than that and refused to meet the rates even when Volvo of Phoenix would. 

I highly recommend you go somewhere else if you want good service!I will never return to this Jiffy Lube.  My experience here was unpleasant.

I won't recount the whole story of my experience moment by moment, but what I will say about this place is that I left there feeling as though I'd been bamboozled and that they'd try to take advantage of me. 

I will say that I felt as if they were trying to sell me ANYthing and everything.  Their gimmick?  They pull out your air filter and show you how dirty it is and try to sell you a new air filter.  they try to sell you all kinds of services.  Despite my stating - I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING ABOVE A STANDARD OIL CHANGE.  Every time I was asked would I like this or that, I repeated that statement.  After the oil change was complete,  I was told my oil change would be $74 dollars.  $74 dollars for a standard oil change?  really?  I spoke with the manger, i wanted them to put my old filter back in and put my old oil back in my car.  I wasn't going to pay for that.  They tried to slip in a charge for some kinda super duper oil despite my repeated requests for nothing extra and just the standard oil change.  The manager did reduce the price back to whatever teh standard oil change cost would be.

I will NEVER go back here.  I quite possibly will NEVER go to another Jiffy Lube.  I can't stand the way they try to push any and everything on you.DONT GO HERE!
I got stomach upset after I ate their carne asada burrito. The standard is not as Filbertoes or Riva's.

STAY AWAYWhy does this place have such good reviews? We drove through and the order was wrong. No flavor whatsoever. Everything was very very plain. Not impressed. I wouldn't recommend it. I am a bit bummed at the wasted food and money.Horrible customer service!!! Sat in the drive in repair area for over 30 minutes without acknowledgment, only to be told they couldn't assist me. Mind you the store and services bays were near empty, and it was 3 hours before closing. All this for a simple nail in the tire. I'll be having AAA put the spare on in their parking lot and going to Discount Tires, tomorrow.Dr. Genet is the Worst Chiropractor Ever!!!! I have had many chiropractors that have done a great job and at American Chiropractic Center they 
Really Suck...... I will never go back and I would never recommend anybody ever go to this location. The Dr.'s at this location are only concerned about the money versus the patient. Dr. Genet acts kind in front of your face but really only wants to take money from the insurance company. Anyone that I encounter about Chiropractic Services I will only tell them to avoid American Chiropractic Center at all possible costs!!!How the mighty have fallen. Time was this buffet was plentiful with good choices. Now even the early birds have deserted this coop. 

The salad lettuce was browning -- the garland around the fruit bar looked fresher. The pastas were cold except the mac and cheese which was tolerable. I think they had pizza -- it was round with a cheese-like substance on it, but I couldn't confirm for you if it had been baked. The fried chicken and fish sat in their grease, drowning slowly from neglect.

No one was at the carving stations and there were no knives to carve the roast and ham yourself. Eventually when we found someone else being served from the station, my wife and daughter formed a line, and then were treated rudely as if the carver had better things to do than serve them.

The only saving grace were the desserts. Let's just say if the ice cream machine wasn't working there would have been a riot.

Fresh: 1/5Out of 5 stars..I would give this place a -12. We passed by an old country buffet today and were talking about how we used to go there when we were little. We looked up online and saw hometown buffet was the same according to the website. So we gave it a shot.

Horrible mistake. We got there at 7:20 and the lady at the counter said "you know, we close at 8", we asked if it was too late to be seated, she said no so we sat. We started looking around at the food. Everything looked like it came straight out of a can. There was a carving station with no knife that looked as if it had been sitting there for days, hospital looking green beans, mashed potatoes, corn,carrots, and some other mystery items (honestly we had a long discussion about what they could be and nothing had a sign). I grabbed a couple things and some chicken nuggets. Everything tasted disgusting except the chicken nuggets(it was clear they were previously frozen). I decided to go back to get some salad, I figured that was safe at least. It was 7:30 and they had already pulled all the salad items to put away. I managed to grab some lettuce before they took it to the kitchen. The lettuce was sitting in water and when I got back to the table noticed most of it was brown (ate some). I figured I would grab some chocolate lava cake quickly before they pulled that too. It was horrible. It tasted like a cardboard flavored sponge, my fiance said it tasted like..a$$.

Now, here's the best part... I walk into the bathroom. All the stalls look like they had been kicked in, out of the 4, 2 were out of order and locked from the inside. 1 of the 2 open ones was clogged and someone left a very nice number 2 for all to see, I went into my last option...THERE WAS FREAKING BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE!!! It seriously looked like a crime scene. It was all over the toilet, smeared on the stall walls, and all over the floor. I was horrified! I obviously didn't use the restroom and didn't know if I should go home and shower or attempt to wash my hands. 2 of the 3 sinks we're broken, literally missing parts, and one hand dryers was hanging off the wall, the other had already fallen to the floor.

How DARE these owners allow their bathrooms to get to this point, and how is this place still in business? I would NEVER go there again.I would give it less than this as they never responded to my letter or emails. It was our anniversary and my lobster was horrible it tasted and smelled like ammonia. I did not eat it but did not want to make a big deal in front of customers or dining companions. So I wrote a Letter when I returned home. No response so I emailed sent another letter. We went there a lot. Never again. If they do not care about their customers there are plenty of restaurants that do. Highly disappointed.This place was terrible! The room smelled like old popcorn when we arrived late in the afternoon. Since we were on a tight schedule and only staying one night, we decided to not say anything. The next morning we found hairs in the shower and on the floor that didn't belong to my husband or me. There were stains on the carpet and plaster/paint peeling from the ceiling in the closet. I don't know how this place got labeled a PLUS - maybe it was because of all the things we found in the room that shouldn't have been. We won't be back and highly discourage anyone from staying here!If you go here to by a car do this: 
1)by some water-based, non irritating lubricant 
2)research positions that are the most comfortable for when you're getting screwed
3)if you're turned on by lying, swindling and games, these clowns are for you!

For starters,hopefully douchebag Johnny lemke is gone from this dealership. Had two back-to-back horrible business deals with this Chapman Autoplex and will not, I repeat, WILL NOT, ever be back. I got cornholed bigtime on my last Dodge in 2003. Me and a couple other co-workers bought from a sneaky and unscrupulous sales woman named Kim Chartier back in 98 or so and I should have learned back then not to come back to this dealership. All of us got screwed in so many ways that it will take me two hours to state what happened. Years later, we still joke about this dealership and how bad we got it. My friend Debbie L bought two or three used vehicles from Kim C and she almost needed therapy when she realized how bad she got screwed, and she could have saved alot of money buying from someone else.I turned in a leased car back to them in 2003 (dont ever lease-sales reps make more commission on leases) therefore I was talked into one when I could have bought the car for $10 more a month. Costly mistake.  And before my lease on my Dodge Neon ended and I still had another payment left, they talked me into ending my lease a month early so i can get sold another Dodge-well they were supposed to make my last lease payment for me and of course, they didn't, and I got stuck with two payments for one month. Also, my interest rate was almost a point higher than I was quoted over the phone-when I went to sign the Chrysler Financial papers, the sales manager was no where to be found, and someone else was left in charge of it. When I confronted the sales manager the next day,  he said I could have free car detailing for the entire time I owned the car!! What good is this when I am not coming back??  I should have walked when the interest rate was higher than he told me over the phone but but I needed a car, was in a bind,  and wanted this horrible experience over with. I was also sold a useless extended warranty that I could have negotiated down in price, but once again, the gal that sold me this made her money and thats all that matters.  After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork, and another issue with my turned in leased car, I called to complain to the head manager, Johnny Lemke- what a jerk, very rude to me, and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing, they won't honor it.I will never buy a Dodge again, never buy an extended warranty-they are a scam and don't cover anything, and I will never deal with this dealership again.  After my experience with them and some issues with my turned in leased vehicle, I got to fight ANOTHER battle with Wells Fargo Auto Lease Finance-totally different story there but I won it, with no help  from the Chapman fu**tards. This dealership did nothing to guide me through turning in my leased vehicle either- I  think they should have recommended me do some stuff as I was buying another  vehicle from them. Nope. You need to do your research on turning in a leased vehicle and don't expect anyone at the dealership to save you any money or give you any useful advice. You need to ask the bank that you're leasing from, where their lot is and turn the vehicle in there. If you leave it at Chapman or another dealership, you will be charged a pick up fee. I ended up beating this and not paying but don't rely on the dealership to make this an easy transition. I hope the knuckleheads that were here back in 2003 are gone. And by the way, my junk Dodge Stratus was totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver- the POS was an even bigger POS and insurance paid it off and paid my GAP insurance so I got rid of the car and wasn't stuck with it any longer. Words of advice: do not lease, do not purchase extended warranties, do not do business with Chapman, and buy from private sellers people- it is cheaper and they are more honest. Run a carfax too.Yes, this place is "really cool" - if you're a college student or on the lower end of the socio-economic scale. (Would Vision Quest last a day if they were in North Scottsdale? I think not. I'm just sayin'....) I think it's incredible tacky, not to mention unethical, for retail stores to do readings in full view of other customers. You're browsing the books, minding your own business, and you have to hear other people talking about their divorce and other personal stuff. Do I really need to hear that? Some of the customers evidently have no shame (and would probably YouTube their doctor's appointments, too, if they could), but some of the readers should know better. Long story short: If "New Age" for you is all about spending $$$ on expensive workshops and seminars and buying crystals and books and CD's, like that Cake song "How Do You Afford That Rock'n'Roll Lifestyle," but only "How Do Afford That New Age Lifestyle?," you'll love the place. If, on the other hand, you're mature enough to realize there's nothing "spiritual" or "new" about any of it, it will leave you feeling a little cold and short-changed. It's too bad this place is the measure against which other metaphysical retailers are judged.Holy crapoley Batman,this place is full o the bunk.
This is the bright sparkly faerie dusty get a pic with your aura(yeah,,,really)tree hugging hippy kind of place wthout Grateful Dead stuff.
All the wannabes,hipsters,and folks who are trying to be oh so exotic and esoteric can come here and get readings in full view of everyone.
Really awkward to try looking at books while someone's marriage hangs in the balance or someone else was Cleopatra TOO in a past life.
Was everyone who pays for a past life look see famous?Didn't anyone shovel shit back in the day?
This place is so phony it's downright laughable.
It's so phony even the staff doesn't have the nerve to even make eye contact.
Or maybe they sense I'm a chi thief setting upon stealing their chakra life force of chi.Yeah,I'll take a bagel with cream chi please.
Maybe I'm there to steal their souls.
I know they can tell.
I'm not one of the corn people.
Vision Quest,just for the record,you suck.Had two homes "cleaned" by Molly Maids- if you want to call it that.    First house was a "move in".   I had already cleaned the bathrooms of the small 1000 sq ft home.   For some reason,  it took them almost three hours.   There were two women and one was talking on the phone NON-STOP the entire time.   She was holding the phone between her shoulder and ear for over two hours!!!  She basically did nothing while the other woman cleaned... over the areas I told them I had already cleaned.    I was charged 169.00 for this!!   Then,   a couple of days later,  they "cleaned" a move out.   I am not sure why they call it a "move out".. when they do absolutely nothing special.   Inside of cupboards were not cleaned,   -   just a superficial cleaning for 149.00.    Moving is so stressful that I thought I would cut down on the amount of work I had to do,  but I will never hire this company again.   I - not being a professional cleaner-  could have and would have done a better job in a shorter amount of time.    Very overpriced,  inefficient and nothing special!I really hate to give a bad review but I was so pissed off after leaving this place I just want to warn anyone who will listen. STAY AWAY!

So first off I explain what I want done and the guy is not paying attention, instead he's talkig to his coworker... I let it go, I figured he's got it. NO! He filed my nails down to the point where hey started to hurt and whenever I would say ouch, he would stop and look at me like I was crazy... To top it off after hurting me repeatidly my nails were terrible. My index fingernail was slanted to the left, it was horrible. I had to go home and make them super short and paint them so they would look decent and then after 3 days they began to lift!!!

I swear to God I had half a mind to be like F off I'm not paying you. But I didn't. (kickig myself 4 it now)

Seriously guys stay away. Goto 101 Nails on Shea instead or any other place for that matter.

Rude people
Bad service
Crappy attitudes
Can't seem to even glue the tips on straight!!

This place is a joke!

Fail!!!Usually when I eat here, my food is good. However, today I ordered from here and the food deserved zero stars. I ordered their General Tso Chicken. I mean, I can't believe they even served me the food that they did. The rice was over cooked and extremely sticky and the chicken was so dry, almost inedible. 
I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you're looking for decent Chinese in the south Scottsdale area, go to New China Gate on McDowell/Hayden.If you are a Chinese food junkie like me, try another spot. This is the kind of place which gives Chinese food a bad name. Over-fried, greasy and downright tasteless. I had the Kung Pao combo.... the Kung Pao sauce was a gelatinous mess with everything from zucchini to bell peppers thrown in. It was actually hard to tell where the chicken was hiding. The "alleged" fried rice was still in the shape of the ice cream scoop when it arrived. The "fried" rice had fused into a starchy ball. And did I mention the egg roll. Hmmm, maybe I did't because it was one bite......and off to the trash.So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.Worst experience ever from this great place! Body builder about 35 behind the counter, lost our order after 35 minutes, asked when our order would be ready. Got major attitude! asked for our money back, he wanted the receipt after just taking the order 45 minutes before and loosing our order. where did the nice guys go?This review is based on just food.

I have no idea why people rave about this place. Ill go piece by piece.

Counter style ordering doesn't really bother me, and the guy taking my order was super cool. The behind him though, kind of a jerk and kept bitching about getting in late orders. It was close to closing probably 45 minutes out, I wasn't at the 30 minute mark so I think i was good. I walked in and then 20 others walked in behind me, obviously DeFalcos is no stranger to later diners.

Ordered chicken parm and mac and cheese. The chicken cutlet itself was absolutely nothing to call home about. It was pounded out, breaded and friend appropriately, nothing special at all. The pasta was way over cooked, and the red sauce, was watered down and lacked any depth or flavor. Ive cooked, and eaten both American Italian and traditional Italian my entire life and this sauce fell very short of what I expected. It wasn't like it was a quick crushed tomato, garlic, red pepper, onion, basil sauce that you through together on Tuesday. It was an I spent all day making this sauce, let me dump some water into it. 

Mac and cheese, same deal. Noodles were overcooked, the mornay was a joke. Literally watered down and tasted like nothing. I tried to taste it, it literally tasted like nothing. I put some salt and pepper on it, it tasted like nothing and salt and pepper. 

Finally the garlic bread. It was good, extremely reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. Not being rude here it just was reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. I regret having to write this, i thought everyone was spot on about this place but it was not good at all. 
My $0.02.If it had been possible to give zero stars, I would have.
ordered their hand made pan pizza. Complete and utter rubbish.  Raw uncooked dough in the middle.  Bland, boring and pathetic toppings.

VItos is close.  Momma Spinnys is close.  Why did I fall for the advert and believe Dominoes might, possibly, produce an edible pizzaWent here for an Orange Julius. It was $3.50 for a medium and it didn't have any ice in it. It wasn't cold at all and definitely wasn't worth the money.Ugh!  We normally come here for breakfast which is good, but made the mistake of having lunch.  WOW, what a disappointment!

We both ordered salads and ice tea.  It came with wilted lettuce that seemed to have it's strawberry dressing tossed hours earlier.  The portions were minuscule which we didn't finish.   The tab came to $24.76.  Ouch!

So, skip the lunch and keep to the breakfast menu.

Sorry!First of all, I love The Good Egg. I live near the one in the 85250 zip code and it's great. 

I used to go to this one, which is close to where my elderly father lives, almost every weekend. The past several visits, though, have made me stay away for good. The reason? Flies. They seem to be everywhere, even indoors.

I've mentioned the fly problem several times to the cashier and wait staff and the answer is always a blithe excuse that they come in from the patio. That's not good enough. It's become bad, really bad. So I'm looking for another inexpensive place for weekend breakfast/brunch/lunch nearby.I brought my dog and was told he had to stay outside their patio area which is fine however 25 minutes after being seated outside and ignored I left. No one to even say "we'll be right with you!" Just kinda shocked me. I'm sure I'll give them another shot someday, but for now I'm totally turned off.Giving them 1 star is already giving alot. LET me start by saying some of the workers there have attitude. I asked a lady if i could have a peach strawberry smoothie and she rolled her eyes at me! You're not Bon Qui Qui. Don't treat me that way.

I let it go and came by another day to get a PLAIN bagel with PLAIN cream cheese...it took them exactly 19 minutes to give me my bagel. I was SUPER late to work..and It was not at all busy, plus the bagel was cold and it sucked. 

I heard they had salads too, so one day I came for lunch ( it was 3:08). I didn't even ACTUALLY say I wanted a salad yet, but the "lady" bursted out "I saw you looking at our lunch menu.. our kitchen is closed. We close at 4" UM. Is this really a business?? I work at 2 businesses and both treat customers with respect. If a customer comes before 4 you still have to serve them, well REAL businesses would. Narrowing it down:

-BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.
-WORKERS HAVE ATTITUDE.
-LOW QUALITY FOOD & DRINKS.
-INCONVENIENT "LUNCH" HOURS.My wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely.  This kind of customer service (or lack thereof) is simply inexcusable for any business establishment.  I advise you to go elsewhere for your tailoring needs.No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn't have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.I was in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale visiting college friends with the New Boy and celebrating the New Year holiday.

On New Year day, we dragged ourselves out of bed around 2:00 or 3:00 and heading to Mill Ave because we were STARVING.

Ra seemed like a good choice, so we struck in and found ourselves sitting on the back patio--the music inside was just WAY too loud. Our waitress made sake-bomb-action happen, which was a blessed relief. That was the best part of the experience.

The sushi was *ok*, the service sucked, and the ambiance was weird. We waited for over 30 minutes for our bill...I was about to walk out without paying just because I was tired of the place.

The overly-loud music varied between classic rock and dance music...they should have just left it on the dance music and left Cheap Trick and Foreigner at home.Ra is the worst place to go for sushi.We decided to branch out of our South Mill lunch routine and hit up RA for specifically for their lunch specials and previous speedy service...and walked into one of the most baffling service experiences ever.

Some of us ordered sushi - which came out quite fast, others ordered other lunch specials that took anywhere between 30 - 50 minutes to come out - if at all.  When 80 percent of our group had their food (40 minutes into our trip), the server asked "Are you missing anything?" looking at the two gentlemen who did not receive their food yet and she asked "What did you order again?" when they told her she replied with "Would you like me to go check on that?!"  at which point most of us were done and ready for the checks - so one decided to for go eating altogether figuring it would take another 30 minutes and the other requested that his food, which was on its way out, be boxed up to go.

The checking out process continued to take quite some time due to tickets needing to be corrected, and the to-go food wasn't up yet.  Finally - 20 minutes later, the food (that had been delivered to the table) was now boxed up and ready - so we headed out.

When we arrived back at the office, the boxed up lunch was in fact incorrect.

All in all, the food was good - the quality for the price of the lunch was good - but the service was ridiculous.....Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!

Anyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave. 

I am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast. 

That's RA in a nutshell.On Sunday the 5th of may. A couple of buddies and I were craving some sushi. I recommend RA since it was close but one of my friends is a huge yelper. Won't go to any restaurant that has less that 3.5 stars. This RA on mill had 2.5..anyway I talked him into goin. They ordered a couple sushi rolls and I ordered the teriyaki bowl. My first bite was super crunchy. I immediately spit it out in and ended up spitting out shattered GLASS. There was broken GLASS all in my entree. Personally, I couldn't believe I didn't cut my mouth or swallow any of the glass. The bartender removed the plate immediately.. the manager came and said sorry asked if I was okay. He said I could get anything I wanted and they would take care of it. I was so shocked that I had GLASS in my food I lost my appetite. The manager took care of my drinks which were 2 margaritas. But my friends each had to pay for there sushi that they didn't even end up eating because they lost there appetite as well. I don't know how the manager didnt take care of the whole bill. They are lucky I didn't hurt myself while I was chewing on glass. No wonder it has 2.5 stars I will never eat at a RA restaurant after the poor experience I had while dining there.We literally stood in the entrance for 15min and the hostess never showed up as people kept piling in. And the security staff standing there gave no explanation as to why NO ONE was present to seat people. Just stood there. So we left. I can see why it has such low ratings...Dear Bouncers at Four Peaks,

So many people "judge a book by its cover"--and for good reason--the "cover" is the first impression that one gets of a business. At Four Peaks, you make for a terrible "cover" and I will not return until your attitude improves. Get off your high peaks. Until then, I'm off to buy a 40 of Bud Light at Circle K.

Kind regards,

Former CustomerWhere should we start....hmm...should it be that it took forever for  the waitress to acknowledge our sheer existence (we actually had to ask another near by flirting waitress to help us FIND someone). Or should it be that once we actually ordered our appetizers, it took--not to be redundant--FOREVER also. Or should it be the overall quality of the food: everything tasted like soggy, salty fat (We mean, how are you going to F up spinach dip)! We understand the fact that it is bar food but if it is going to taste like that and be way over-priced for it's bar food quality do not waste your time unless you are already inebriated 

So lets review....
1. Horrible service
2. Takes a long time for food to come (It's BAR FOOD, COME ON)
3. Over-priced salty food (Pete's Fish n Chips same quality; way cheaper)
3. Only go if your wasted because then you will not care about the quality of food (or how much you paid for it),  remember the horrible service, or the fact that there is a gang of blubbering drunk idiots, lowering expectations with future regrets.The food is mediocre and so are the drinks. I don't drink beer but this seemed so popular. Worse then the food & watered down drinks was the horrible horrible service. My food took forever only to find out it had been given accidentally to another table who ordered the same thing. And had recently arrived. It happens,  but my waitress didn't seem apologetic and my food didn't get to me until over an hour after I arrived. I had ordered their garlic cheese bread which was just a thin crust cheese pizza with no pizzaz. 

I really wanted to avoid heading to Yelp about my awful experience as I contacted them directly two weeks ago right after my experience. Needless to say I got no reply, no apology, nada.

Will never go back.I'm not a fan. Their beer isn't my favorite, and their food is sub-par. I haven't had problems with the servers, but the bouncers have really poor attitudes. I'm not someone who ever has issues with security, so a bouncer really has to go out of his/her way to make an impact on me, but I will not be back. I want to go out to have a nice time, not be insulted by someone on an ego trip. There are so many awesome breweries in the valley, I would definitely recommend going somewhere with better beer and friendly staff. Sleepy Dog is awesome! Also, Huss, Arizona Wilderness, Pheonix Ale, Papago, Desert Eagle, Gordon Biersch, Nimbus...I am usually very easy to please at restaurants, and have been eating sushi for a while now. I have had some funky food service in my day but this place kinda takes the cake. I would advise you to stay away from the combo meals and special sushi rolls. We ordered the Godzilla roll today and got 8 bite-sized rolls of cucumber, spicy tuna, and cream cheese. I have had the same but better roll from Safeway, except i payed 10 bucks for it at sushi 101. my girlfriend had chicken katsu, it was chicken nuggets and bbq sauce basically. Dont get me wrong i love asian food and eat lots of take out Chinese, it takes a lot to get me heated. My entree was the spicy chicken lunch combo which consisted of what tasted and looked like chopped cabbage and just a little shredded chicked stir fried in soy sauce, bland miso soup, and hard rice. my buddy payed 12 dollars for the soup and a sushi roll smaller and simpler than mine. I think I'l stick with stingray or crazy fish, this place was just all around bad news from the get go, and i would never go back, it was like a blind German drunk man with one arm cooked our food on the fly. the local scary chinese take out around the corner from my house has better food by at least ten fold. Also, our server checked on us once and we had to track her down three times while we ate, i dont understand how they are still in business, now i am 40 bucks out and still hungry.This has been my favorite sushi restaurant For the past three years, so it is really disheartening to see that over the past year their service has tanked. First of all we took our younger brothers to a place where we knew the food was going to be good, the flavor was great as usual but the presentation has really gone down. A year ago we never got a plate that didn't look spectacular, now it's sub par. Our server was just nice enough to do his job although most of the time it was the other servers or the busser doing his job. There were a total of 5 full tables in the whole restaurant this visit and I counted 5 servers and 1 busser who were all sitting at the bar chatting with the chefs (manager included) so it was frustrating when we had a spill at our table and there was no response from any staff. We cleaned the spill ourselves, we even got up and went to the busser station to get more napkins. The only response we got was after the mess was cleaned our server asked us if "we were okay" and I had to ask for the drink to be refilled. This is not the first bad encounter that we have had there this last year but this was our final straw. There is a lot more I could say but I think this is sufficient. We have given them several chances and the benefit of the doubt for the last year but our visits to this establishment are over. Each time I go there and have a bad experience I give the management feedback and each time our service seems to be no better than before.just got here the server brought water and beer and then disappeared for 10 min and I don't even know when she is coming back ! Wow terrible place here!I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich.I got a bunch of breakfast food and basically the whole order was wrong. There was sausage seeping through the bag and they added 3 things we didn't even order and forgot 2 sandwiches we ordered. The food looked absolutely disgusting. The eggs look like a big pile of thick mustard the sausages were dripping so much with oil it was seeping through the bag. The lady even asked us if we needed extra syrup and hot sauce and she didn't even put them in the bag...wtf? I have two young children who were very disappointed when we couldn't eat the food because it was just disgusting. And when I called them and asked for a manager she answered the phone and said you're speaking to one in a very very rude tone. And then I started telling her what was wrong she said bring it all back and we will redo the order....well no I have two young kids I don't have a car I can't be going back-and-forth it's just not logical for me then she interrupted me and rudely said what what's missing from your order I couldn't even believe how I was being treated so I just hung up the phone I will never go to this McDonald's again and I'll make sure every single person that I know doesn't go to this McDonald's either.  Timestamp 10 AM May 20, 2014These guys are terrible i dont recommend them. They take forever to do the work and the price is always more than what they tell you. Go somewhere elseDon't do your yoga training here, Here is why:

1. Class sizes is uncontrollable. They fit in as many people as they can so you won't be getting the individualize attention.

2. Teachers have their favorites, needless to say that I was not one.

3. Very disorganized!

4. They force you to buy their books from their book stores. I downloaded some of the books on my kindle and they made me re-buy them in paper form from their bookstore. In other words they don't care about trees being cut down. :(Service and food suck balls!First time here for a party off 2 after passing many times on mill. We were seated outside, given our menus and that was it. We waited 15 minutes and still not even  water. We left, made sure the manager knew. They offered a free meal, but it's not fun eating your food when you know the restaurant knows they messed up.please please please do not stay here! 
i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review! the customer service is soooo soooo poor!! after having almost 500.00 held on my charge card after i checked out, i called to find out why this charge was on my account.  i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name! i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas (which i do). he called me a liar! .. and as of right now still out 500.00! what establishment hangs up on their guests? this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received! what if i was a shopper? 
do not stay here! save your money! they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.  
aside from the horrible customer service, they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations. that wasnt great, but whatever, the pictures do not resemble the motel. the "game room" is not a game room.  its a room with an atari in it.  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep, you can count on it here.  all these things, i could get over. however, the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow. he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services. 
do not stay here! you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner.
i should have known better for such an inexpensive place, but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places... wrong! you get what you pay for... and worse!This school is full of stuffy politically incorrect coaches. I am speaking football. My son recently tried out for their football team and showed enough talent that the coaches spoke to him one on one. He hung out with the wrong people and got into trouble which is why he moved away and came to this school for new hope. He worked out 2-3 times a day, studied drills for his position every minute he wasn't studying and then came the day you found out of you made the team. He was not listed. Why, because they did not want to " take a chance with his off the field" actions Nothing to do with him being 110 capable to do the job. 
We are now looking into transferring into another school. How Ironic would it be to play against a team who didnt want take a chance...Thanks ASU coaches for the motivation!!Deplorable. 

I was with a group and check-in is always at 3 pm. We arrived at 4 pm and only 2 of the rooms were available. 

I was required to sign a release for each room, requiring none of the group members would smoke. When I arrived at my room, I guarantee not only had someone been smoking in there, but someone had been smoking a cigar. Putrid. 

I was also blessed with having the room directly above the first floor restroom, which apparently does not have an ample ventilation system, so my room smelled like a cesspool the entire weekend. 

So, if you don't mind smelling like a cesspool for the weekend, I guess this is the place to be. 

Oh yeah, and they decided it wasn't necessary to clean the pool, either. There was garbage floating in the bottom and true pond scum floating there. 

Not very pleasant.My regular doctor had me taken here with an irregular heartbeat--I arrived in an ambulance.  I then spent 8 hours on a gurney, waiting for a room becaue of a nurse shortage.  After two days I hadnot seen a cardiologist.  The second day, the cardiologist sent over his nurse practicioner.  Wow!  Could you spare her!  The third day, my heart beat had stabilized, but Ihad to wait 2 hours to be discharged  for the big cheese cardiologist himself, who had not bothered to drop in, to see me so I could leave.  He was a slick hustler with dyed hair who called me "young lady" (he is not a young man himself) and talked to me for two minutes.  Ugh.  Id never go to this hospital again.  A summary:  one of the nurses got into an argument with a heart patient , with her voice raised, over how long people
have to wait in emergency rooms.  I froze all night, and am covered with bruises from their inept staff taking blood.  Dr. Noori, an internist, was a gentleman and a good doc--hope he finds work elsewhere.  The idea of a cardiologist being too busy to see a patient and sending a frickin nurse instead, still makes my blood boil--avoid this place unless you are half-dead.I have been going here since it first opened as the "only" PJ location in town, & with the original owners. Since they went into franchise, the staff has turned horrible and the food is not much better... we have gone back multiple times over the last year, hoping things would get better. We will NOT be going to this location again. This is a great shame as I am vegan and they used to be able to cater to that - when they actually took pride in their cooking. Sad state when the best PJ is in Gilbert... To mgmt or owner or whomever cares about this location: hire better staff and start showing some interest in your restaurant!Horrible venue, workers have terrible attitudes, they pat you down and take random belongings like you're automatically a criminal for going to a show.  Over-priced for sure.  I will have to really really want to see a band before I buy more tickets for this place."Festival Seating", huh?  There was no warning when I bought tickets for this venue . . . and what a shock to see that there were no seats.  Security folks made us stand up well before the concert started, probably because folks were packed in there way past what would be deemed a safe volume of people.

The sound system was not good, acoustics were poor, the sound was over-processed.  It was a horrible experience; my worst concert to date.  I would suggest buying the artists DVD instead of going to see them live, at this venue.I took my teenage kids to see Lindsay Sterling last night... I guess I should've looked at the venue reviews first.

Here are my low points :
1. If you have any issues with being on your feet for extended time, DO NOT COME HERE. We stood for 4+ hours, making line outside for more than 1 just to get in. Just to find inside that there is No seating anywhere. 

2. If you require absolutely no personal space, you might be ok. We unfortunately did, and this place was packed to more than its capacity. We were sandwiched in there, and walking out we saw tons of people standing outside both the auditorium and the building itself. Way overcrowded.

3. If you value your ear drums, DO NOT COME HERE. I get it, I'm not that young, and concerts are meant to be loud, but when even my kids are uncomfortable with the volume, and when it's so loud that it distorts the performance, then I don't get the point.

There is no way we will be back.This restaurant is so over priced and mediocre I can't even eat here at all. The best place to get Ethiopian food is ethio-african spices in Phoenix. Don't go anywhere else. Trust me. I spend 50 dollars on just me and my boyfriend at this cafe and the food is dripping with grease leaving you with gas every time, and the injera isn't that good. If u want perfect Ethiopian cuisine for a fraction of the cost SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO PHOENIX.Worst customer experience ever from these inconsiderate pricks!So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.

I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.

When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.

The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  

I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!Gus's never ever surprises me anymore. Walked in the other day for carry out and they charged me $ .50 for my credit card transaction. WOW !!!! They have all these crazy little charges for everything you can think of. 

1. Credit card fee ( delivery and carry out ), maybe even dine in? Don't know never eaten in. 

2. After midnight delivery fee 

When it's late go to Ihop.$9 pie with fees and tax was $13. Took an hour to get delivered. And it tasted like garbage. Highly encourage anyone to avoid this stinkhole. Even the delivery guy was a dick.This place is a joke. 
I placed a togo order on a Sunday so when they told me it would be an hour I figured ok lots of football business. The kid who dropped off my order first told me the price. I paid him then hands me my pizza and soda. He started walking away. I had to announce that I didnt get my wings. His response was "Oh, Did you want them?" Ummm yeah dude why would I order them. I asked for the money back and how much they where and subtracted it for him. 
I called GUS to inform them, a manager was put on the phone. She had the vocab of a high schooler. Her response was "Well Its not like he was trying to be rude or anything, he would have come back to get them and bring them back to you." Then she says they dont do refunds. All I have to say is Really lady.

Anyways. There service sucks.

I opened my pizza and its cold. Dont you think if its an hr wait maybe you should cook the pizza closer to the pick up time.

Never again! I would rather have frozen pizza!Absolutely the worst pizza i've ever had. With all the local cheap late night options for delivery i have no idea how this place stays in business. It takes a lot or me to really dislike a place, but Gus's, your pizza makes me want to cry.I've had this a few times since.  Delivery takes forever, customer service is god AWFUL.  Seriously, these people are such assholes.  You get what you pay for, and this place is still a ripoff.  Should never be more than a star.Gave them a try because it was my only option at 1:00 in the morning.  The guy on the phone was very friendly, quoted me 45 minutes to an hour, seemed a little long but you can't expect too much at that time of day, no prob.   It did take an hour and again that is what I was quoted.  
Unfortunately the pizza was not edible.   I was expecting bad pizza, hoping for good pizza,  and more than prepared for cold pizza. But this was my first delivery experience with horribly BURNT pizza.  We were ravenous at this point so we picked off some shreds that we could eat, and most of what we ate was still burned and disgusting. 
Low expectations have historically kept me from being much of a complainer, but seeing that useless pizza I'd paid for in my fridge the next day, instead of something to eat actually convinced me to make a phone call. The girl on the phone was friendly and apologetic, but had no authority to do anything for me.  She said she'd pass my information and receipt along to her manager and that I should expect a call. 
No call.  Enjoy the photo.it sounds bad, but it tastes worse. go to hungry howies. even that junk is better than this.In the past I've been a frequent customer of Gus's and always found the pizza to have a distinctive taste but since they've gone into new management, I don't expect to return. My few visit in the past two months weren't pleasant, I've encountered rude workers at the front counter who seem like I'm making them go out of THEIR way to get my order, which is no more than a few steps away nonetheless. Workers stand around and seem to be hanging out so don't expect to be welcomed with open arms into the store, you'd be lucky to even get a smile. Seriously, that's how bad their customer service is. The pizza has always been good in the past, but I'm completely displeased by what I received today. Half cold pizza, sorta warm around the crust, but in the middle was dead cold. I had to toss it in my own over for another 15 minutes in order for it to be edible. I don't want to know what other undercooked foods they'll be serving me, if I could give this place no stars I would but since I can't it earns a 1 star rating. Never returning.Ok so the service is fine here but everything else was terrible. They didn't have horchata, my taco was made with a hard shell and had lettuce,  might as well have been from taco bell. The chili renos had no flavorand way too much egg for my taste. It was also pretty pricey. Sorry but there are just too many better options for good Mexican food for you to waste your time here.I just had a horrible experience there.  I've been to this place a few times before.  Never really impressed but gets the job done.  I just happen to have a hankering for pho since it had just rained.  Rare event and rain causes me to think of comfort food, which pho definitely is up there on my list.  

I come in, sat down, water served and barely glanced at the menu when I sh!t you not, the guy (I think he's also the owner) comes to my table and said something maybe like "Ready?" but it sounded more of a grunt.  

I had just happened to look to see that the #7 was what I wanted.  I ordered rare beef pho with meatballs.  He then takes me menu right off my hands.  Um...I was going to take a look at the spring rolls, but ok, I guess I didn't really care for that.  I'll just sit here and sip my water, without a straw, which I would like if someone would come by.  I knew I wasn't coming here for service.  Why is it so rare to have good service in Vietnamese restaurants? It must be a tall order but at least smile dude.  I guess that's what I pay for.  And then a cockroach walked across my table!

Eeew!  I shoo'd it away with my napkin, looked around to see that no one paid attention.  Ok, I won't make a big deal.  I just want to eat and go back to work.  I noticed when I looked around that there was a couple in the corner looking across the room for service waiting for their bill.  They don't know you're supposed to pay at the register, without getting the bill first.  Then 2 guys seat at a table besides me.  They were handed their water and menu almost immediately after sitting down.  hmm prompt service....seconds later dude comes over to grunt.  He just sat them down.  One of the guys looked at the other and chuckles, he wasn't ready to order yet, they just were settling in.  OK it  was not my skewed perception, he really wants us in ready to order.  Then the roach came back around.  I'm done with this place.  yuck. The guy must've eyed them because once the guys put their heads up, boom there he was again, "ready?"

My pho came and I ate it quickly, hungry, don't want to think about it.  Pho was so bland and disappointing.  The bowl was small for $7.50.  Upset with the roach more than the horrible service and food.  Went up to register to pay and darted out of there, never to return.  In and out in about 10-15 minutes.I hate this place. Seriously  hate this place. I have been coming here for 10 years and they still tell me restrooms are for customers. Never mind that I work at Chase, I'm wearing a badge and a collared shirt and purchasing an ice tea...I'm probably not a customer...I'm probably a crazy vagrant that is going to poop on the floor in the bathroom, yea I said  it, but it wasn't me....It must have been the last person they let use it.. A real customer. Disgusting.. 
The food here sucks. Their bagels are stale, their eggs are not from a chicken, I don't know where they are from.. Maybe a giraffe (ok the banana bread is good but that's it), their drinks are over priced. And even though the chick behind the counter looks like she is on crack, she must not be, because she certainly can muster the energy to wipe down the counter.  AND THE COFFEE SUCKS!While visiting in Arizona I was surprised to see a place that actually had a real espresso machine, and more surprised to see that the employees had no idea what kind of coffee they were serving.  Even if it was a light or dark roast, but by the taste of it I'm assuming it was roasted for the taste buds of a chain smoker.  Although it really depends on who makes your coffee.  I made two visits, one with a friend to try the double espresso, and another by myself to see what the milk was like.  The espresso I didn't watch being made, as the machine is placed in a way that watching requires you to be in the way of the people in line.  It was pretty undrinkable, but it didn't make my stomach sick, which was a plus as far as espresso around here goes.  I came back and ordered a latte to see what was going on, and I watched a scruffy guy shove my coffee untamped into the machine, and then put my milk under the steam wand, turn it on, and walk away.  Heads up buddy, the Marzocco doesn't auto-foam, you just scalded my milk!  Needless to say it was completely undrinkable, and I threw it away after the first taste.

Needs some serious training on how to make coffee.Panchos- 2 eggs 2 pancakes & your choice of meat. I had bacon. 

For my bacon, all I tasted was Salt! Eggs were good. Pancakes were tasteless. Service was ok. But I would NOT come here again.They need a better rain policy.  Standing in an exit line... i mean mob with 7 kids in lightning and pouring rain is not only unsafe but inhumane.  You want us to wait in the rain for 15 to 45 mins to see if it stops raining before we can get a return pass... really?!?! Why do you really need to retrieve an armband in the midst of a monsoon storm?!? Tacky corporate greed... Get a clue Golfland.  Very disappointing first experience!First, I will say that I have been a regular patron of this hotel in the past. For my most recent experience, I was treated with extreme disrespect and disregard despite the fact I have chosen this hotel in the past. It was a Saturday night and my girlfriend and I had returned from a night out on Mill Ave. Things turned intimate on the bed, but noise levels were well within reason. We inadvertently left the curtains open on a second floor room facing the courtyard. We finished our activities and got up to get dressed and saw a security guard running across the courtyard screaming at the top of her lungs to close the curtains. Surprised and embarrassed, we immediately closed the curtains and sunk into bed to go to sleep. The security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up. As we were tired and not dressed and now that the curtains have been fully closed, we attempted to drift asleep. This only lasted a short while until our door was pounded on by the police. The property was asking us to leave. For what??? We had to pay a taxi to take us to another hotel and pay for alternative accommodations. At least this hotel was hospitable to us. We kindly requested a refund from Mission Palms as we were not able to stay the whole night that we rightfully paid for. It took three weeks for the management here to even respond and we were denied this request.  Couples and anyone else who plans on doing what this hotel thinks of as "indiscriminate activities" in the supposed privacy of the room you pay for, BEWARE!! Stay elsewhere!!!!!Went in, middle of the afternoon. Only two tables are seated.  A cook from the back came out, saw us and went back to the kitchen. We waited to be seated for 10+ minutes and eventually left and went to Riverview IHOP. 

The next day, we tried the IHOP on Apache again. It was morning and packed. Waited again for a while, no one came to seat us. Back to Riverview.
Won't be returning.I promised myself I would not write this review.  But, I couldn't even keep this promise to myself.  My eating partner told me I owed the world this review considering that money is tight and people need to know what they are getting or not getting for their money.
The staff was friendly upon our arrival and we were seated expeditiously.  Not too crowded for a Saturday night, hmmmmm.    My eating partner wanted to sit next to me instead of facing me so he began to move the placemat & silverware to the other side.  The waiter trying to be helpful, put all five of his fingers, on what was destined to be my plate, and swished the plate next to the other plate.  Helpful, but I was somewhat concerned about where those five fingers had been last.  i was soooo self disciplined that  didn't say a word, but I did use antibacterial hand cleaner on my plate.  With mersa and other types of infections abounding, I didn't want to take a chance.  
Papdum came with coriander chutney.  Crispy and plentiful.
The chicken biryani served to us had a strange color.  Very very red, as if cooked with tomato paste. Spicy as we asked but with no flavor.  Just heat.  We like the heat but the food has to be tasty.  (I thought of the delicious biryani that we could have had had we driven to our old stand-by that was further away from our house.)  What a difference a couple of miles makes.  Then the Chicken Vindaloo that was ordered spicy, was delivered spicy but with no flavor.  Indian spices were not strong enough; just chicken in a red sauce.  Even the tartness that vindaloo sauce requires was missing. Vindaloo is one of those sauces that contains a little bit of vinegar (just check any indian cookbook).  The tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce.   
The people are nice enough but the food is probably one of the least favorite I have had in the valley (I was going to write worst, instead of least favorite but that would not be very nice).  
Suffice it to say that my Saturday night dinner was less than tasty and certainly less than memorable.  
Moral of the story:  Drive a few extra miles and go to a place where you know you will get excellent food at a fair price. It will be worth the drive. (Did you read this dear eating partner???)A group of us ate here about 3/4 weeks ago and while I cannot fault the food, which was delicious, I would NEVER set foot in this restaurant again because of the sheer rudeness we experienced from one of the waiters. Normally I would complain but we were that shocked that we all left bewildered. I spoke with anither colleague a week later and he said he and his wife experienced the same behaviour. There is no way that the management can be unaware of who I am refering to as they stood out like a sore thumb behaviour wise as I found all the other staff extremely pleasant. Sort it out as there is no shortage of excellent Indian restaurants in the area.Avoid this place if you care about your health.Here's a novel idea: Open a comedy club with food that doesn't come from the freezer section of Costco.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?  

I had high hopes for the "new and improved" Tempe Improv.  I love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening.  Unfortunately, the new policies have made it that much harder.  

They automatically add an 18% gratuity to EVERY CHECK.  Had our service not been terrible, I wouldn't have minded this nearly as much.  Our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything.  We asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show.  Long before this though, two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table.  

They've changed the "two item minimum" to a "two drink minimum" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier.  

The menu looks very much the same as the old menu.  The food quality is, overall, poor.  My husband's quesadilla was TINY.  It looked like a child's plate.  My buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before.  It had clearly been around a while.  It wasn't even warm and was tough to cut.  The pretzel appetizer was okay but I am spoiled for pretzels thanks to Claim Jumper and Arrogant Butcher.  These were slightly better than the Super Pretzels you bake at home. 

The drink situation is highway robbery, prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time.  My friend and I ordered standard cosmos.  They arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid.  They were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else.  The waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table.  Upon reviewing the check, she did take off the cosmo but I noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for SMIRNOFF.  Smirnoff.  Are you kidding?  She even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no.  Smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind.  What do you get without an upgrade?  Harry's Toilet Vodka?  We all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down.  

The one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor.  Admittedly, it was nice not to be so crammed in.  

Despite these issues, we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw Michael McDonald).  As I said earlier, I love stand-up but the current practices at the Improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back.Went today to pick up a to-go order and was very disappointed.  

We ordered two salads and a sandwich with slaw.  While they mastered putting the tuna salad on the side of one salad, the dressing we ordered was missing.  Neither salad came with a side of bread.   

The sandwich was very large and good, however the slaw tasted a little "funky"  almost rancid.  


Also, to-go salads should come with forks...... just saying...Never have I been so disrespected by an employee at an establishment.  Maybe you should think about how you make money, and how creating a bad rap for yourself hurts only you.

I went in last night for one beer about 9pm and sat at the little outside bar deal in the back. The female bartender was passing out calendars and drink coupons to everyone at the bar EXCEPT me. She totally skipped over me and when I asked "where's mine" I got a total fucking attitude. She told me I never asked for one and I explained I'm not a mind reader and she should have offered. She didn't offer to get more, she didn't apologize, whatever. A couple minutes later the couple two stools down from me said this is a great calendar and I replied that I wouldn't know. The bartender then flipped out and started telling the couple, not me, how she has no problem "owning these stupid ASU kids that can't handle their liquor." Way to judge, bitch. I'm not an ASU student and I've only had 1/2 beer at this point. 

I called for a manager and told him I have 1/2 a beer left, I'm not paying for it, I'm leaving and never coming back, and I'm going to tell everyone I know about how rude your bartender is. 

He gave me all sorts of free coupons for the block party, $1 drink coupons, and of course that calendar I wanted. I'm still not going back, ever, no matter hot skankily hot the cocktail waitresses are.My boyfriend and I have been going to star liquor for the last six months, usually 3 to 4 times a week. We pick them because they are locally owned and like to help support,BUT after tonight I won't return!!!!! The owner was extremely rude and has been the last few times we've been. My boyfriend always pays with his debt card and it's not it the best shape, because its USED. Yes, it's time to get a new card, but turning away business because his card it pretty old is not good business. The owner didn't even bother asking if we had another card ( which I did!!!) or cash to pay with. He said "Go somewhere else"..... Really??? I was stunned and now just mad! Went across the street to QT lol it's the same price, but still angry that he turned away our business over a card. I guess QT just came into a lot more business from us!Absolutely beware of the parking. I paid huge dollars for Wicked tickets months ago.  The performance is next week. I received an email TODAY that no ASU parking is available as school is in session. The closest parking is on 5th and Maple.  This should be disclosed at time of ticket purchase so an informed decision can be made.War Horse was played here and due to the size of the theater you could not hear a line from the actors.  We were in row 17 of the Orchestra and the general comment was excellent sets, no idea what was happening on stage.  This theater is a disaster for acoustics.  Don't plan on hearing anything unless you are up frontAttend a Broadway in Arizona performance at Gammage Auditorium and you'll receive a copy of Gambill, a local version of Broadway's Playbill. It's no doubt meant to be a cute play on words but what it really means is that it's a gamble whether or not you'll be able to hear a word spoken or sung during a show you and your date paid upwards of $120 to attend. 

My husband and I attended our first Gammage event in April of 2013. We went to hear David Sedaris speak. We were in the second row and the audio was terrible. The author had to restart his talk because no one could hear. The volume got louder but was accompanied by a screeching buzz the entire time. We chalked it up to an off night and optimistically purchased Broadway in AZ season tickets.

Big mistake. The sound at each show was just as terrible. Apparently, unless you sit in a narrow "sweet spot" in the center orchestra section, be prepared to read lips. Better yet, just bring along the soundtrack and headphones and listen along on your own. Last night's performance of Once was so hard to hear that the gentleman in front of us who'd brought an assistive listening device gave up on it one song into the second act. 

I might be able to overlook the venue's shabby seats or the dark, dank restrooms if the sound quality were any better, but it isn't.  Until ASU takes their audio issues seriously, we won't waste any more money on tickets to Scammage performances.I will NEVER go here ever again and it will be my pleasure to tell EVERYONE I know to do the same!!!!!!!! The bar is actually very nice and the bartenders are really chill. However, the security is horrible and power hungry. Whoever the tall skinny dude is with the beard and hat is a nut job and should be fired. He kicked me out after I went outside to check on my friend to see if she was ok.  Yes, her ID wasn't legit. However, how does that concern me? She was there before I got there, I didn't even go with her there. I just saw her there. They threw away my 8 dollar beer and wouldnt let me in. Screw this place.. Until they fire abe lincoln, i aint going there anymore.this place is ridiculous.
ive had pretty mediocre food from here a few times, but its down the street from my house so i think i just keep hoping it will get better. The Carne Asada is totally bland. And their quesadillas are practically inedible. The one good thing is their salsa and bean dip.

So I just called to place a take out order for a side of bean dip. The woman informed me that chips do NOT come with the bean dip and it would be $1.99 extra for them (Do most people eat bean dip WITHOUT chips?). Ok. Fine. I will pay the $1.99. Then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips, to which she replies no, salsa is extra as well. I hung up. Everything they were trying to charge me for is FREE if i was going to sit there and eat my bean dip! 

I think i have finally given up on this place
just go to cheba hut next door ;)Average salsa and all around dirty.  I cannot give a good rating when the menus, restaurant and restrooms are repulsive.  Sorry!

Staff was very nice, but owners should think of replacing carpet, paint and pressure steaming the bathrooms!I went here last night for my friend's birthday, the staff made us all feel uncomfortable, they acted like they were better than us and almost seemed annoyed that we were there. We were the only people in the lounge and the music was uncomfortably loud. When I asked them to turn it down to a more comfortable level, the two people working there again seemed annoyed and almost appalled that I would ask such a thing. 

In short, I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that I was the one who suggested we should go to red sea.If you are not past 70, or a yuppy hippy this store is not for you. 

Completely overpriced, most sandals for women were over $100 and looked like something my granny donated to goodwill. They carry all sorts of birkenstockesque kinda shoes.

They boast "comfort" shoes, but who cares where you are walking when your feet look that ugly. I'll sacrifice a bit of comfort for a hot pair of wedges any day.Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk.I usually go here about 1:45- 2:15 a.m. Fridays or Saturdays during the school year to watch people fight., the pizza tastes like cardboard, and the crust will cut the roof of your mouth. Also there ranch tastes weird...Dark dank bar with not much going on. Workers were not overly friendly. Live music is on the weekends and it is typically heavy metal.Awful drinks. The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible. Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.I did not pick this place, met some people there that picked it. We waited 1 hour for our food, the waiter forgot our drinks twice and the food was just okay. To top it off, I checked my credit card charges a few days later and the waiter charged my bill four times for my bill and they were all for higher than what my bill was for. Fortunately my credit card company only allowed one charge to go through recognizing someone was not being honest.  I would not recommend this place to anyone! Service sucks and they are dishonest.I went to Tempe Bicycle @ 405 W. University and I was the worst experience in a bicycle shop that I have ever had.

I went looking for a tune-up on my bike, left it with them came back the next day and they hadn't done anything to it and hadn't mentioned any suggestion on how to improve my shifting problems with my bicycle.

I felt like they handled me like a cow in a heard and it wasn't even busy being summer (may 21st 2008)

The other thing that I should mention is that my bike seat was stolen and the wanted to charge me 10 for a bolt to replace my quick release bolt. That's TEN DOLLARS for a bolt....these guys are no good crooks and don't deserve your business...I learned my lesson and called around for referrals after that and found tow places that I would trust in Tempe.

They recently moved so I would call: 480-967-7700I came here with my girlfriend before a night on the town.  The clerk acted like a jerk the whole time we were ordering, asking questions with a put-off tone and eventually over charged us for our drinks.  Not only that, but both the drip coffees were clearly old, burnt and disgusting.  After receiving our drinks and taking the first sip, both the baristas started to laugh.  What was wrong with the coffee besides the burnt taste is beyond me but it was a joke I didn't find funny.This is the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to. They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store. The tables are always dirty, there are crumbs and litter all over the floor, the bathroom was gross.... I wish it was enjoyable, because the location would be great for studying. I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on.I had only eaten at La Fonda's Mexican food restaurant three times. The first two experiences there were great. The staff during the day is the family that actually owns the business. The service was fast, food was hot and fresh, and waiter was friendly. However, the third time I ate there was for dinner with a friend of mine. We got there and had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant! What a nightmare! We decided to stay and have dinner since it was already 7 pm. We both ordered there standard margarita there which tasted like salt water....no flavor! Our chips and salsa were good like the other two previous visits prior. The chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment. The meat inside was luke warm which made me a bit nervous. How long was the meat sitting? We were so disappointed we just up and walked out, never been back since. give this place a second thought before trying them out. it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant.This place saw me coming a mile away. I thought that since my then boyfriend had taken his car there and always gotten a good honest deal, it was an alright place. Boy was I wrong! My car wasn't starting and I was desperate for a fix. After charging me over $600 to "replace cables" in my vehicle, I took it back a week later because it would not start. They then told me the fuel pump was broken and needed to be replaced. So I spent another $300 on that. About five days later, it would not start again. At this point, I told them that THEY would be coming to pick up my car and figure out what was wrong with it, free of charge, which they did. Their conclusion? Water in the gas tank, which they told me they could take care of for ANOTHER $200. Needless to say, I didn't go back. They definitley ripped me off. Don't go there!Sub par sushi (at best) and terrible service! I had eaten here once before with a group of friends, and wasn't all that impressed, but we had a $25 off coupon, so decided to give it another try last night.  

Big mistake.  First of all, the place was a ghost town, which on a Thursday night in Tempe should have been our first indication to leave. 

We sat at the sushi bar, not more than 2 feet away from the "chef". He never said hello, or even looked us in the eye. He did however, turn to his coworker and make a derogatory comment in Spanish about my partner and I. Not a smart move, as we both understand and speak Spanish quite well. 

Needless to say, we left the restaurant and will never return. If I'm going to give a restaurant over $100.00 of my money, at the very least I'd expect not be insulted. 

We went down the street to Sushi 101, where we should've gone in the first place, and had an excellent meal, with outstanding service. 

Never again, Crazy Fish. Bigoted staff aren't good for business.Don't waste your time or money. Service was bad (granted it was her second day according to the bar tender) but food was not good! The nori tasted bitter and was probably really old and the fish sure didn't take like fish. I should have know when I walked in and there were only 2 tables. Just because it is a good location (kinda- it was hard to get out) doesn't mean you should go. Stay away!  I think I'm going to be sick.I will never ever, ever, ever, ever go here again. Last night I was there for Fat Tuesday celebrations. Was there for a good 4 hours, walked a few feet from the back entrance to take a phone call and when I tried coming back in they tried to charge me another cover charge. The security guy acknowledged that he seen me walk away and insisted that he could not let me in without another fee. When I asked who his boss was he refused to give that info. I had already spent a good $80 on myself there and didn't think it was right to charge me to reenter the event I had already been at and spending good money on. This experience was so bad that I will not spend another penny at this establishment. I now absolutely hate this place!!!The blonde lady that works interrupted me to tell me HER thoughts every time I was considering a piece.  A friend and I were having private conversation and she thought it necessary to interject as much as possible.  What made it worse was after I made one comment she apparently didn't agree and was condescending to me.  We left without making a purchase and I will not be back.Took over an hour and 30 minutes for my food. Yvonne's needs the old owners back. 



I've eaten at Yvonne's for a long time. I've made a few comments to the owners about how a 45 minute wait for a quick sandwich isn't acceptable or a quick lunch spot. 

I started ordering delivery food from them because of how long it takes when I'm there, and this isn't any better. My food just took an hour and 36 minutes to get to my office which is literally the next complex over. Upon asking the OWNER why it took so long to get here, he have me the same excuse as he did last time. When I told him he's told me that before he said "oh..." And just turned around and walked away. 


I won't be eating from there again.The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice.
She made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.

The guy... I don't think he meant to be racist,
but when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders,
he goes "Amigo, someting wrong?" 
I could not believe my ears lol.

The food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)

I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.

Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.
Bulgogi was not well seasoned.

The food was bland and nasty.

Was NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again.The old house is a fitting name for this joint. A old house that has not seen a pest exterminator in years, an old house that still serves food from the yester years.. I've been here on many occasions and the food is always  fair to poor, the filet mignon is either a joke or from some other animal I have never heard of. The salads wilted, the croutons stale, the bread stale, even the smell in this place is stale. I hesitated before writing this review but 4 out of 5 visits were awful. I really (yes really) did see a roach on my last and final visit. The service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty. Go somewhere else for a steak, it's worth the extra few bucks.There used to be a Monti's across from Fiesta mall and that was a much better location. The ambience in this location is horrible, even if it is considered a landmark. The bread they give wasn't as good as the one at the newer Monti's that closed down. The fried zucchini I ordered was also hard and tasted really bad. One of the worst dining experiences that I've had.I used to love this place maybe it's better for dinner. But lunch was not good. The food was not good. I got four onion rings with my meal the sandwich was bland the burger was slathered in a1 sauce. Last time we went was like this. I thought it was a fluke bad day. The server took 20 minutes to get our drink order we had to ask other people repeatedly for stuff. Just very disappointing all together.If you like Elitism, and rude sales people, and inflated prices this is the right place to go.....

Very good selections which sucks because I won't be buying a single thing here after my experience today.

After dropping off my Carbon Wheel to get a new tire fitted, and to be checked I bought a rear brake setup for my Volume, they had a few less expensive ones which seemed perfect for my commuter bike.

After getting home I discovered non of the pieces fit, took proper measurements and came back to exchange for the correct pieces.  What I got instead was major attitude from several of the employees, and they stated that my bike was probably not made right and a cheap piece and that all brakes were universal......what they got was me canceling my tire, and refunding my money for the brake.

I drove right up the road to Tempe bicycle (whom I loathe but also have a lot in stock) who were miraculously able to have the very pieces I was looking for to get my brake setup, for much less....

Seriously this place blows donkeys and I won't be  back here ever....it sucks because their repair staff seemed nice an knowledgable.

Theres better places in town try Kore, REI, or Sport Chalet....or even online, Usually when you have inflated prices the way these guys do the customer service makes up for it.....in this case it does not.


On a side note I am still fighting with them to get the $200 I spent there and immediatley returned it because I found the same product for $50 right down the road at Tempe Bike..... 

So far they have given me several excuses as to why they haven't been able to return my money as well as given me a bogus authorization number.....shady business practices from this company buyer beware.I went today with my daughter who was to have a birth control procedure done . I was there to take care of my 6 1/2 week old grandson, who nurses and hasn't quite taken to being bottle feed. Of course when my daughter was Finally called to go back, my grandson started to fuss. Yes he fussed and cried, I did my best to soothe him. Then the administrator of the center came out and told me I had to take the baby outside. I said to her "don't you think it is too hot for a baby to be outside?" she then told me I was disturbing the other patients! So I carried what was most valuable, my daughters diaper bag, my purse, and my grandson outside to 104 degrees, past the smokers who were waiting for there family or friends being seen. I walked with this tiny baby up and down the strip mall. I can understand that I made others uncomfortable with his crying, but surely this very insensitive "administrator" could have been more sensitive about how she handle this. Maybe she could have offered to call my daughter so I could get the car keys, helped me carry his car seat out for me. Or how about offering me an empty room with air conditioning. I am 55 years old and have over time been very glad Planned Parenthood was there for me. But today I feel they failed, by having an administrator like Catherine represent them. I pled with you,that you yelp reviews to get the proper service, respect, and dignity from the different locations. I hope that no other guardian has to do this to their precious baby. And like the prior review, I also would give this facility a negative zero!This is the absolute worst motel I have ever seen.  Was put up there by delta airlines as they had to cancel our flight.  I walked in the room to find a huge cockroach on the floor.  The room just smelled.  I didn't sleep all night.  Filthy!Back in 2007, my car (BMW 540i sport) was involved in a minor accident and one of the front rims was damaged (18" M Parallel). The bodyshop (whom I had a working relationship with as I am a former auto dealer) outsourced finding a replacement to Wheel Specialists. Wheel Specialists sent the body shop a replica M Parallel. The rim was obviously a replica as the lip was slightly different, the color was slightly different, and the rim lacked the OEM BMW markings. Getting an OEM rim was very important as the OEM rims were forged and the replica was not. I told the bodyshop I would handle the mix up. I went to wheel specialists directly to handle the situation and I dealt with Brad. He was a gigantic asshole. He refused to admit the rim was a replica. He basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about (even though I specialized for years in BMW's). Even when I pointed out obvious differences (lack of a part #, differences in appearance, etc), he wouldn't budge. The attitude I got from him was "leave me alone, go away, and let me get back to buying underage girls vodka-tonics in Scottsdale with my d-bag friends." Needless to say, I eventually gave up. I recently went back to wheel specialists to look at some Vossen rims. They gave me a competitive quote, but I used a different shop because of my previous experience with them. Had something gone wrong, I doubted they would have fixed it.I don't know what happened to this place!  It used to be a really cool, low key place to find funky, interesting, or possible name brand clothes and accesories at great low prices.  Well I went in last week and they are selling used "designer" jeans for the same price I could go and get them at the store that sells them!  $40 for Abercrombie jeans?!?!!!  Seriously?!!  Such a bummer.  I don't think I will be back for a while.This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.I knew this place had poor reviews before Yelp was even around but was in the area in search of food. I improvised and went to one of the first places nearby.

I ordered a combo that was 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a drink.  Came out to just under $10.  For price comparison, the same thing at Long John Silver would be $5-6.

The shrimp were flat out awful.  They butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it.  I removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably 10 times smaller than the amount of batter used.  They use realllllly small shrimp, like 50-100 ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store.  

The fries are below average.  If you are going to have "chips" in your name, you need to have some of the best fries around.  They do not.  

 Their fish was okay because it wasn't overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it.  Fried fish should have a light batter.  In fact, nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use.  To top it off, their fish is served in the most natural of shapes.... a square.  If I want awkward looking fish, I'll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks.
  
I saved the worst for part of the meal for last.  Their signature sauce.  That stuff was awful.  It tasted like it was 50% water and 45% ketchup and 5% vinegar.  They don't give you any tartar sauce, no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu.  I figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but I was wrong.  I didn't even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce, it was just more mediocrity.  

On to the most obvious quirk about the place, cash only.  If you are a cash only joint I assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down.  Then why is the food so expensive?  It certainly isn't high quality.  It certainly isn't any good.  

Bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = 1 star.Was highly disappointed with this place after hearing good things... the good things were lies I tell ya, all lies. This fish was just awful and some of the saltiest stuff I have ever put to my lips. I didn't eat what I bought and I won't be going back. Long John Silver's looks like gold compared to this place.15 minutes after my wait in the drive thru of "cash only" I couldn't help but think about the negative impact this business has on the environment. I see several cars ahead of me receiving several bags of food. It starts to make sense "why the wait"; large orders. Finally my turn! I think to myself; "this should be quick, my order is small"... 6 more minutes later I finally get my change and food. What I learned about my stay at the window... One person's job is to check to see how many cars are coming while the other two prepare food, with no sense of urgency, I've seen molasses move faster. Upon arriving home I see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam. Nice Pete! My mushrooms are just water battered in salt and there is an excessive amount of "chips". I generally don't like wasting food, but, as I am not a pig and all I wanted we're fish and "mushrooms" I did throw some away. I don't imagine this food ages well. Needless to say; I experienced them, I don't get it and I will not be back.Went as a group of 9 to kick off a fun night on Mill. I don't know who suggested it but my girlfriend and I had no say in the matter. (I would've been fine with Five Guys.) So we show up at Caffe Boa and it looks great - the decor is nice, there are a lot of people there, all signs are good so far.

Then we sit down and take a peak at the menu - everything seems very overpriced, but being the optimistic type, I assume this means it will be really good. Well, you know what they say about making assumptions...

For a drink I ordered a Sugarfree Vodka Red Bull. Nothing too special, so it's relatively hard to screw up. Somehow, they managed to. The ratio was entirely off and I ended up with a bitter glass of ice and vodka that barely tasted like Red Bull. If I wanted to get screwed up it would have been great but that's what the rest of the night on Mill was for.

Then came dinner. Girlfriend and I were a bit hungry, but probably not hungry enough to eat what had been described as "huge portions," so we decided to split. A seafood lover at heart, I suggested we try the scallop/lobster/crab ravioli. I have a feeling if I had ordered something else, this would be a very different review.

What arrived at the table, next to huge dishes of pasta that almost nobody managed to finish, was a dish with five raviolis in it. FIVE. The dish was $22 so for those too lazy to do the math, that's $4.40 per ravioli. Between the two of us - that's 2.5 raviolis each. "What," I believe was the first reaction to the dainty portion.

I could have literally bought two cans of Chef Boyardee for that amount. And upon tasting Caffe Boa's seafood ravioli, it was clear the Boyardee would have been more satisfying. If I had been there alone, this would not have been such a sour experience, but getting to watch our friends dig in to what appeared to be much more savory dishes and not even finish them was heart-wrenching for a food lover like myself.

We ate the raviolis in a fraction of the time it took everyone to "finish" their dish. And by finish, I mean eat as much as they could, wave a small white flag, and request a box for leftovers. Everyone else appeared to enjoy their food but from a taste standpoint, a portion standpoint, and a logic standpoint, the ravioli shouldn't even be an option on the menu. Substantially less food than the other menu items would only make sense if it was delicious, and it wasn't. I've never disliked lobster or scallops like that.

Certainly an experience I don't want to repeat. If I could ever fathom making a return trip, I obviously wouldn't be having the ravioli. What makes me the most angry, though - we told the waiter we were going to split. Why didn't he warn us we were paying $22 for less than half an (unappetizing) appetizer?

Overpriced is something you earn. Caffe Boa has not earned this distinction.So, I returned. Wow, this winter menu sucks. I will not go back.

Technical difficulties. When I was finished, all systems were down and I had to wait to pay. It would have been nice if my waiter had told me this during the half hour I sat there agitated and kept asking for the check. Before finally manually taking my credit card info.

BUT MY HUGEST GRIPE:

I had the Farro Risotto (Foraged Winter Mushrooms, Stracchino Cheese, Green Garlic $16 + Wild Shrimp add on for $5 more). 

It tasted like... how can I accurately describe this?

You know how after you're sick to your stomach and you vomit, you get *that* breath? You can taste it, smell it, and it makes you cringe. It's vomit breath.

Well, my risotto TASTED like what vomit breath SMELLS like. It was pretty much VOMIT BREATH OATMEAL with four delicious tiny shrimp, whose taste was miraculously unmarred by the vomit concoction that was my anniversary dinner.

Honestly, I ate bread to fill myself up. I didn't want to send back my food (though I did complain about it, but my waiter didn't really even notice anyways). I took over half of my meal home to feed to my roommates as a cruel prank, since they were jealous they couldn't go with us to eat at Caffe Boa... imagine it. "Yeah it was awesome! I brought some leftovers home... you want some?"

One of them actually vomited. The other dry heaved for half an hour and lost his appetite. And, all of my leftovers (minus those two bites) are stinking up my fridge.

Yeah, the roommate torture part was hilarious (they now hate me, ha ha ha ha)... but Caffe Boa lost a loyal customer.

Actually 4, after you count my roommates, boyfriend, and myself.

And, there's still enough Risotto left in the fridge to taint at least a dozen more people against the place.

This was Caffe Boa's last chance after my last visit there, and it was an epic fail. Someday a year or two from now, I MAY consider going back.... but I really doubt it.

I'll miss it a bit... some of the food was amazing. But I don't give a place third and fourth chances, no matter how good it is on occasion.Not cool!!!  I've only ever visited the Phoenix location and had outstanding food and service. Tonight has been COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  We were entertaining clients and the experience couldn't have been worse. I made the reservation for 11 a week in advance. We arrived at 6pm and had clients who had to catch planes at 9pm. It took more than 45 minutes to take our order.  At 8pm after repeated requests on the status of our order and communicating that we had travelers on a tight schedule we were told that one of the entrees was burned and it would take longer.  When we then asked to speak to the manager so we could explain the situation, we were given nothing but attitude. At that point we had had enough and got up to leave.  The owner met us at the door and threatened to call the police if we didn't pay the bill. He then offered to give us $200 in gift certificates. Hmmmmm.... Why can't he just accept his mistake and take care of the bill?  At least we would have given this place a second chance. Instead he refused to provide customer service and told us not to tell him how to run his business!  As we stood outside and argued with him for 15 minutes, 3 other parties left and told us it took over 2 hours for them to get their food. Come on people!  I understand that mistakes happen, but for crying out loud just fix it!!! I will NEVER set foot in this place again, and I'm guessing neither will the other 30 people who exited along with us.RUDE staff that wouldn't spit on you if you were on Fire... mixed up our party's orders, ignored us when we needed waters.  Honestly, it was the attitude of the staff that completely turned me OFF to this historic restaurant.I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple "I'll be back with your orders." When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...i guess my new thing will just be writing reviews about all the shitty bouncers at bars in tempe.

back on st. patrick's day i was going into casey moores and as i was locking up my bike as i watched a bouncer beat up an innocent drunk guy, who was already out of the bar and on the sidewalk trying to leave. he was pushing the guy telling him to leave but pretty much wasn't letting him leave by grabbing his shirt and throwing him around. the drunk guy kept saying "i'm trying to leave, stop touching me!" the bouncer ended up throwing the guy against a car and punching him while he was on the road. then he dragged him onto the side walk and held his head by the hair and started hitting his head on the sidewalk. the bouncer was bleeding from the hand and when he noticed he started saying "you bit me, omg i you bit me! i love putting people in jail. you're going to jail" once the cops showed up they wanted my story since i was a witness. me and two other people gave the police our story. once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite. probably cut it while beating the guy up. 
anyway, i went into the bar to get a drink and i was told to leave because i talked to the cops. i guess the managers really support a roided up bouncer beating up an innocent drunk guy.
SO fast forward 3-ish months and i go back to casey moores with some friends. i was there last night and GREAT the same bouncer is surprisingly still working there. when the night ended i was outside the bar in the parking lot and the bouncer comes up to me and whispers "if you fcking tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here" and i respond with "what??" and he says it again "you heard me. if you tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here. you're on a list you know" and then went into the bar. i hear the bouncer get crazy in the bar and start yelling and gathering staff and is talking and pointing at me. so i just stand there and wave.

also great idea to make a scene like that in front of a parking lot full of people if you don't want me telling anyone.

sorry bouncer. i told the internet about how shitty you are. maybe have some respect for people and talk to people nicely.

i'm not sure what else to say but i wanted to tell my story about 2/5 of my experiences of ever going there. i'm fine with not being let back in, especially if they're going to keep staff like this around.

BESIDES these incidents i've had good experiences here and the other staff is awesome. nice nice people.

*the bouncer who did this was a Caucasian, short stalky guy kinda chubby, short brown hair, has a scruffy beard, usually has a backward baseball cap on.How is a utility company listed as a contractor on Yelp?. They are a government created oligopoly which has conmtributed to a campaign to smear solar owners in Arizona. There inability to change and embrace new technology (solar and fuel cells)  will cost Arizona  customers in the future. It never rains here, why not invest in solar? Instead, SRP through their lobbiests fight solar and attempt to pit solar homeowners as taking an unfair advantage of the utility company. Honestly, every rooftop in the desert should have solar panels attached. SRP and APS need to wakeup and enjoy the sunshine!KYOT how did you quietly invade all of the offices and restaurants of my life?  I've had all of the George Benson, Chuck Mangione, Spyro Gyra, and Kenny G. one man can take for a lifetime.  You've done it, you've smoothed me to near death with what you falsely call "jazz" (I have another word for it using three of those four letters).  I know others have been led astray by your wallpapery aural seduction, but you can't fool me, you just can't.Blech. Just blech. I guess all good things have to come to an end...not sure why since this place always had such great food. When we ate there ten, twenty years ago the place was always so crowded that lines formed to get inside. The food was always fresh and delicious and when you left you walked away with a full belly and a happy smile on your face. Even five or so years ago the food was good...but tonight we got take out...now I know take it is not a good as eating it fresh  in the restaurant, but we live ten minutes away from this place. Hubby got steak and chicken fajitas and they looked like they had been sitting around all day. He said the veggies were so greasy he couldn't eat them. My meal earned the real blech. Greasy, greasy. The guacamole was greasy and had an odd taste. Not sure what has happened but I guess that the magic is gone and the food tasted like it had been previously cooked and warmed up. I'm sure it was all made fresh today it just didn't taste that way. A TV dinner would have tasted fresher. 

Now, sadly we cross off yet another Mexican restaurant here in Tempe. No one near us knows how to cook fajitas. We have to go to Jalapeño's Inferno up in Scottsdale to get them. They have awesome food, great chips and salsa and the best margaritas around. Unfortunately it is about an hour drive from our house.

Wish I had better news for you people craving some good Mexican food. My husband said there was not a soul in the place tonight save for one other person who was waiting for their takeout order. We did order late so they might have been getting ready to close. The food sure tasted like left-overs. That is no excuse. Drive down the street and Panda Express keeps bringing out fresh trays up until the doors are locked.
Guess I need to sharpen my chopsticks. 

At this rate, another valley landmark might soon be going away. The Mesa Serrano's on Dobson and Guadalupe shuttered its doors. We ate there and the food went downhill too. When it opened it had the most amazing food and service. This makes us old-times sad. We remember how great both locations were and we miss the good meals we ate there.

I didn't bother to call and tell them how lousy their food was since they probably would have offered us a free next time meal. I think not. We do not plan to return to this restaurant...at least not in this lifetime. Mediocre food...I can cook that at home!I hate to pile it on to a local restaurant that is struggling, but it is what it is.  Walked in to the pizza side, very hot, was directed to the bar side, waited ~15 minutes for my pizza.  Had the 12" white pizza for lunch, with the advertised lunch specials being unavailable @ 11:40.  Ricotta, mozzarella, whisper of garlic.  Very lackluster, the cheeses seemed old, with the ricotta being especially clumpy and not creamy.  The crust on the outside edge was terrible, with the crazy sensation of toothpaste somehow.  A cavernous bar area that was completely empty from 11:45-12:25.  A very depressed owner matched this soulless mockery of a restaurant.  Pay your respects for 15 years of service... and move on.the worst pizza ever. pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like Wonder bread, all doughy & sweet.  This place is an insult to Italian pizza.  These people arent even Italian. Just SAD.Not what I expected at all. All the reviews say it's amazing, better than Bianco's, blah blah. Not really that good. I mean it was barely edible. I had the marg. pizza. Nope sorry! It was just a cheese pizza really and super small with some improperly cut basil over the top. The crust was pathetic. Typical all purpose flour used, no flavor, not crusty and chewy, too much extra flour on it which made it dry. Mix between Weber White bread and a bagel. Very compact crust. Heavy!!!! YUK! The Cheese on the pizza was not bad. I feel he did not cook it long enough for my taste. Looked like a pizza from wherever. I also had a salad and the lettuce was cut so big it was ridiculous. I won't be going back. Plus their beer selection sucks. I guess Polish beer for the Polish owner. Seriously though, Polish beer in an Italian Pizza joint? What the cuss? $31 for a pizza that tasted like a step down from Trader joes Frozen pizza (actually that is better), salad that I could have made at home for .43 cents and polish beer. Go fuck yourself Classic!!!They don't allow for online ordering and did not pick up the phone when I called in the order. Either they are shut down or they are the worst Domino's Pizza I have ever encountered.Thieves. They want $6 per check even though the check is from a Bank of America account. Can't stand Bank of America. The dick everyone around.We've lived here for a year now and are NOT resigning. The unsatisfactory posts are all accurate for the majority of people who live/lived here. When we first moved in we also had a cockroach infestation.. The place was trashed (coloring crayons all over the walls, back patio, kitchen). Mold was covered in our toilets and showers, the sinks were clogged with hair and other disgusting particles. The dryer had not been cleaned out leaving a HUGE fire hazard had we not caught it. On top of that, many drawers were broken and when we asked maintenance to come fix them it took almost a month. 

About 2 months in to our lease, our washer broke. It took 3 weeks to get a new one. Four months later our dryer broke. We contacted the front office about it for THREE MONTHS until someone came. Even when they came they didn't fix it and left mess. A month after the mess, and a few more complaints, we finally got it fixed. 

Finally, this past week our A/C went out. Our roommate called the office while we were out of town to get it fixed. When we came home it was still out and had to call again to get it fixed. Two days later, we woke up sweating with no air because the maintenance did a half ass job (as always). 

Above all the horrible customer service and lack of taking care of tenants, the community constantly smells like marijuana, is not secure (two locked bikes of ours were stollen) and filled with very rude people and staff. Although this place looks nice and is in a "quiet" location, your money will be much better spent elsewhere.One word is GROSS.  From the FILTHY menu that literally SMELLED like it was wiped with a filthy rag... and-of which we all had to share it  at our table as they didn't have enough for the place) to the over-sauced sandwich that I sent back and got a hockey puck hamburger instead... to the POOR service (girl didn't even come back to ask if everything was ok)  Save yourself and seek another sports bar.  The inattentive waitress also thought she could get away with charging my credit card an extra buck and I had already RELUCTANTLY  left 15%  !! Caught it reconciling my account so they even committed credit card fraud. I will NEVER be back to this dank and filthy place.Wendy's is no luxury dining experience in any case, but this one is exceptionally bad.  The ketchup dispensers are broken, but the staff doesn't care.  The cashier used more obscenities than I would like my six year old to hear.  The dining area was dirty.   Worn paint and damaged seating everywhere.  The bathrooms have a gas station feel to them.  The food is low quality, even by Wendy's low standards.  

If you must eat here, get it drive through and keep your expectations low.Terrible--to be honest if the mixed smells don't scare you away the obvious addition of food coloring into everything breaded should.

I've eaten here three times and every time I've been violently sick, off two chicken dishes and one pork.

Any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant is better then this!I used to stop by this cookie-cutter bagel shop about twice a week to grab a coffee and a bagel on my way to work.  I mean, it was convenient, up the street from where I lived.  

I stopped because my idea about customer service is not to give customers grief, and not to mock customers who are looking for an efficient (hell, that's why you are a cookie-cutter shop, right?) way to grab something because they need to be somewhere.

So, after about 6 months of not stopping in there, I decide to give it a try this morning.  What a mistake that was!  Two people behind the counter, no line, one customer waiting for a bagel to be made.  One of the counter staff was on the telephone, the other was making this other customer's bagel order.  I assume I'll be helped next by the staff after this other customer's bagel order is finished -- no dice. Instead he grabs what apparently was a large telephone order being taken by the other staff person and begins making those orders, and this other staff person for some reason needs to enter this order into their computer.  I wait another 5-10 minutes, meanwhile a line is forming behind me, and still nothing.

Avoid this place!bleh.....bland as all hell....even being super cheap was still a waste of $I wouldn't do this normally and I am a big fan of KFC Chicken strips; but this location sucks. Bad. Like really bad.

I tried to go in just today for lunch. The drive thru was packed, so I walked in. There was a line 9 people deep, and no one taking any orders. The staff seemed to be working, but no cashier?!?! Not even anyone acknowledging the line. The one person who was inside getting thier order (to go) had to get them to correct it as they gave him the wrong chicken.

It's at least the 2nd time that I've had bad luck at this KFC, and I waited 5 minutes in line then I left (still no new orders in front of me either).

Sorry KFC, you won't see me here again...I used Abe's shoe repair in the past and was very pleased with the service. However, I will never use this service again. The guy running the business now should not be allowed to even use the name Abe's, as this was once a very professional business. The guy was very rude and projected and attitude that it was a privilege for me to do business with him. He was one week late on the dye job and it did not turn out to my expectations. I can see this place closing due to lack of customers because the guy running it is clueless when it comes to interacting with customers. No  business skills at all. I even had to wait for 20 minutes because he did not open on time.Wow this is the rudest place I have ever been in! I just walked in and was not even greeted. There were about 5 people at the reception desk and not one of them said hello. I was interested in purchasing some Aveda products but apparently the staff is not interested in making a sale. I will gladly spend my money elsewhere probably just go to Mood Swings on Mill.Firestone was my go to auto shop for 2 years but I've gotten sick of their upselling and pressure tactics.

The last straw came when they wouldn't rotate the Michelin 100,000 tires I had with lifetime wheel balancing and rotating. Apparently there was "too little tread" and they advised me to replace all 4 tires asap. (While also dropping that they had a promotion for tires and steering me towards some $400 ones)

I took my car to Hon-Man and they told me that my tires had some typical cracking from the AZ heat but was otherwise fine.  

I used to go for their $14.99 oil change and service check but I'd rather spend $29.99 at Hon-Man to get an accurate diagnosis. This isn't an isolated incident either, everytime I've come to a Firestone they print out a listing of "urgent" repairs your car needs.

If you love Jiffy Lube scare tactics your gonna love the treatment you get at Firestone who seem to only look to pad their monthly billing reports. If you want an honest reliable mechanic that actually passes on the savings to the end customer go find a nice shop like the Honda servicing Hon-Man.Love church's but the service here is a joke always slow, you would think at noon they would be prepared for lunch. The staff is always very impersonal and act put out to serve you. This location needs some serious helpWish I could give it NO stars.

My mother's dragged me in to this place many times as she likes to shop here.  I always felt like no matter where I was, what I was doing, people were flying at me like I wasn't there - NO respect for personal space.  I could be picking out tomatoes or browsing the cheeses and I would LITERALLY pushed out of the way by some stinky hippy.  

The last time I shopped there was the LAST STRAW.  My mother had BEGGED me to pick up an exclusively Trader Joe's item for a dinner party she was having.  TJ's is very close to my house.  I reluctantly agreed.  Since I knew exactly what she needed, I told my husband to drop my fat, sweaty, pregnant ass off in the front and I'd hobble in there to get the 2-3 items my dear mummy wanted.  Again with the people rushing at me.  Oy vey!!!  

I'm standing in a line that had 3-4 people in it holding my items, sweat dripping off my brow and my 9 month pregnant belly growing by the minute.  The young man in the checkout line next to me says "Excuse me ma'am, I can take you here".  I smiled and as I was hobbling over there, some ASSHOLE rushed up to the checkout counter and dumped all his organic crap on the conveyor.  The clerk SAID AND DID nothing. I said "Uh EXCUSE me?  He asked ME to come over."  Both ignored me.  I dropped my three items on the ground (two of which were in glass jars that shattered) and said "FUCK YOU, FUCK THIS PLACE, I'M NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN" and walked out.  

And that was the last time Trader Joe's got any of my money.I used to live in Sacramento and would come home to visit family in Tempe.  At the time this was the only "chinese" restaurant (1990's).  My family would drag me here and I would be aghast at the small portions and steep prices (chow mein for $8-10?) and the portions were about 2/3rds the size of what I would get for $6.  Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.

Thankfully, there about 10 chinese restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place and no one I know even comes near this place.

So if it's high prices and diet-sized portions you're looking for, then have at it.

What cracks me up is that the top 5 restaurants (according to many of the local chinese) are either not even on yelp or have only a few reviews.

The best "yelpers" are the word-of-mouthers.  if it's good it spreads throughout the chinese community like wild fire.  And if it's bad, it spreads faster than a ladies sewing club....(i made that one up)

I would recommend these places if you want the real deal (in no particular order)

1) Asian Cafe Express
2) New Hong Kong
3) Tao Garden
4) Asian Hong Kong Diner
5) Great Wall
6) China King

just ask the locals who grew up hereDISGUSTING!!! I can't even believe there are actually people who have given this place more then one star. I would give it zero stars if I could.

My boyfriend and I decided to try it. Whenever we have chinese we always go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet in Ahwatukee because its very good! Arizona is a hard place to find decent chinese food but we decided to take a risk and we lost!

After paying, we were seated and the table was filthy. There was actually food splattered on the short wall that divded the booths. We went to find plates and there were none. We stood around for about 5 or 7 minutes until someone brought a few out. After walking around I could only find 3 or 4 things that looked decently edible. There really wasn't much to choose from and I was distracted by the dirty floors, walls, and food stations, that I couldn't really think about anything else.
When we sat to eat I took one bite and nearly spit my food out. It was absolutely rancid! I washed my mouth out with my soda and watched my boyfriend make faces at his plate while pushing his food around with his fork.  I glanced down and there was a thick black hair laying across the table. I'd had enough! We got up and demanded our money back. They tried to say we ate everyhing on our plates and I had to explain that our plates were not full because we didn't fill our plates up to begin with! Then they tried to keep the money for the sodas. I pointed out that they were full glasses of soda sitting there and I want ALL my money back. After telling the lady I wasn't leaving without my money, I finally got my full amount back. We left and went to Chompies in Chandler for some delicious food in a clean atmosphere.

If you want some pretty good chinese that's buffet style, try Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet in Ahwatukee. It's off of Chandler Blvd just east of 48th Street.  Seriously this place has tons to choose from, its tasty, has great service, and very clean. This is where we always go and where we should have gone that night.got copies of keys made here and they keys did not even work properly in my door. felt like i was pick locking my own front door. shit like this is a no-no in my book. damn you Ace.Yelp, I cannot think of the words necessary to express my disappointment.  This was not only the worst seafood I have eaten in my life, but by far the worst Mexican food as well.  What are you people smoking?

We started with a few beers, can't screw that one up.  I ordered an appetizer that was completely not as described but I should have known better since it was in the cold section of the appetizers.  It sure didn't say raw oysters, raw shrimp, octopus, and thawed shrimp in a crappy broth.  All for $15?  As if there wasn't enough lack of texture with those ingredients, they throw avocado on top.  Yeah, that will round out the dish.  I am not even completely factoring that into the rating because I should have paid more attention to it being cold.

For my meal I got Marlin Machaca.  What kind of seafood joint serves you shredded fish?  Is it marlin or Tuna?  Why the hell would I want my fish shredded?  On top of that the flavors were just bad.  It was either canned, or just not fresh.  How can you call this place a seafood establishment when they rape the fish so badly?  It came with refried beans, white rice with frozen peas and carrots, and a pile of raw iceberg lettuce.  Why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice?  It doesn't bring me comfort to know they aren't cooking anything fresh.  And why the nasty white iceberg in clumps?  The beans were good and they gave us tortillas so I spent the meal making little tacos and seeing which hot sauce covered up the poor flavors the best.

The other victim ordered the "fish".  How much less information can they provide.  It was a choice between sea bass or Tilapia.  Since Tilapia is a FRESHWATER fish, they lose points and really expose themselves as a fraud.  Hers was much better than mine, but nothing worthy of  taking it home leftovers or ever returning.  
 
Bill totaled out to $50+!!  For Mexican food, and terrible Mexican food at that!  Food was awful, prices were outrageous, it was in the cesspool that is Guadalupe, how much worse can it get?

I should have listened to my inner voice that said nothing good happens in Guadalupe.  It is an unbelievable little place.  The instant you cross over from Tempe to the Guad the road turns to crap with potholes and bumps everywhere.  Businesses vanish, and homes are replaced with shacks.  Minimal street lights and overall maintenance and infrastructure make you feel like 2012 has already arrived.  The best part of our journey was driving away, seemingly crossing an imaginary line of civilization and being back in Tempe at AZ Mills Mall.

Not sure what the expectations are for the other reviewers, but I expect fresh food from the sea.  Much of what we ate was probably out of a can like the octopus, oysters, and the marlin.  The shrimp were most likely frozen and/or precooked.  

Saturday night, there was one couple eating there, and a bunch of drunks outside playing the guitar.  That says more about this place than the unexplainable positive reviews on here.  I will never be able to look at Yelp reviews the same way again...

... The one positive I take from this experience is that I saw a hot dog cart and a taco cart as I left the Guad.  I may have to hit up the taco cart in the future.

(EDIT: I wonder why the other bad review for this place has been hidden.  I should have weighed his opinion more heavily, would have saved me a bad experience and some cash)I've had better......

There was a reason this place was not busy on 7pm on a Friday evening....

For the price you pay, you get very minimal seafood, and too many fillers. For instance we ordered a plate for 1, the special combination with, snail, octopus, squid. It had tiny pieces of each item mixed in with lots of onions and tomatoes and yellow peppers - this plate was small and cost a whopping $22.00 !!!!!!!!  I could not believe it! Then we ordered a ceviche dish, there was non existent seafood, very little shrimp very little fish, however loaded with tomatoes and fillers.  I Will NOT Be Back!

I have been to many Mexican Cantina Seafood Saloons from Baja Mexico to the best in the Southwest US regions. This place does not even compare. It was a waste money over 50 Dollars spent on veggies with very tiny pieces of seafood. A Total Rip OFF!!! 

 I do NOT recommend this place, San Diego Bay Restaurant, A waste of Time and Money!!!This was our first time going to Someburros.  I've heard lots of people talk about it, but until recently had never eaten any of their food.  We recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from Someburros.  We were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves.

We went on Sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go.  The chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home.  The hot sauce IS tasty.  

The service is horrible at this place!  The server was annoyed by our questions, was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working.  We felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service.  

Despite the close proximity to our home, we won't be going back to this restaurant.  
Rather, we'll be going to Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix!Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted. 
I waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense. 
I finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold. 
The seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was. 
I was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.Thai Mix (red curry) I dont know what this is but it's not Thai.  Bland and not even similar to Thai red curry.  If you want Thai food hit Royal Thai Grill or Thai Rama.  I would have been better off going to Panda Express which makes me cry a little on the inside.Let me tell you about a recent visit to the Fry's on Baseline Rd. I went in looking for a camera/video recorder (camcorder? I think that's the right spelling).  I had set a budget of around $300.  Didn't need anything fancy, just a good product.  Upon looking over their inventory I found one I liked.  It was on clearance for $199.  It was a brand name that I like and had everything I needed/wanted.  The clerk advised me that I was going to buy the display model and that all of the clearance items were the last ones they had.  I asked if it came with everything I needed to make the camera functional (battery, recharge cord) and he said yes.  After searching for the "packet" that contained the accessories, the clerk discovered that the battery was missing,  I asked how much a new one was and he stated that he was not sure if they even carried it.  He found out that they did and the battery was $80!!!  I stated that there was nothing on the sign that stated the battery was missing.  I asked him to either give me a battery or take $80 off the price of the camera.  He told me that he couldn't do that, so I asked him to get me somebody that could.  He called the department manager, who was at lunch and he said that he could take $20 off the price of the camera.  What good would that have done?  I asked to speak to a store manager and was told that she was busy.  Ok, now I'm P1$$ed off!  So now I write their corporate office.  The response apologizes for the bad service and says I will receive a call......still waiting some 2 weeks later.I have a love hate relationship with this place. They have great prices. Sales people are very slow and don't have much knowledge. A lack of interest is beyond belief if you are buying something that is of low value. Don't buy anything if you think their is a chance it might need a repair within its warranty. I've had not one issue with them refusing to deal with a repair issus but two problems. The attitude of customer service is shocking. But again this could be the reason prices are lower than most places. Source on amazon or best buy is my advice.I've been to Rosati's plenty of times before (never this location), any my experience has never been this bad.  I called in a carry out order at 4:30 pm (This is well before the dinner rush).  The girl taking the call doesn't take my name and unceremoniously hangs up on me after saying the pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  I show up at 4:55pm, and say to the girl at the counter " I am here to pick up a carry out order".  She asks my name and I tell her the girl on the phone didn't ask my name.  She responds, "oh yeah, I didn't".  She checks on my pizza and tells me it going to be another 5 minutes.  Fine, I pay and sit down on the bench out front.  I can over hear what sounds like 5 - 6 teenagers talking loud about energy drinks and their work schedules.  By the way they were cursing I imagine they either forgot I was up front or do not care.  The girl at the counter came back at 5:05 to tell me my pizza is almost out and it shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.  She then leaves to go to Albertsons.  I am not high school math teacher but I know it takes longer than 5 minutes to walk to Albertsons, pick out your energy drinks, pay for them, then walk back to Rosatis.  But all of that happened before my pizza came out.  5:15 pm my pizza is ready.  That's 45 minutes on a slow night.  I've worked in pizza places before and know it doesn't take that long to cook a pizza.  All would have been forgiven had the pizza actually been cooked.   When I got home the family sat down and to eat and were surprised by crunchy (uncooked) onions, and extremely under cooked dough.  I'm wondering why I game them $28 for one of my worst pizza experiences ever.  

Let me restate this, we normally LOVE Rosati's pizza, but this is our first time visiting this location.  It will also be our last.  I'd much rather pay half that price and get a better product from Barro's across the street.  Maybe the Roasti's in Chandler will be better...This place sucks, non English speaking staff, the ones who can speak English are druggies, very rude to say the least... the prices are way too freakin high, how does this place stay in business...I used to like shopping here. I don't like the NEW JCPENNY, it's confusing shopping in their store. Not a fan of the new style and merchandising.

 I can't even tell the employees from other customers, they are dressed so casual, I don't remember seeing a name tag to at least know that they work there.Do we have a complete lack of intelligence here? It's not rocket science.

I was totally unimpressed with this location, but I did end up with a GREAT funny story to re-tell over and over. Math is not the strength of our future youth that work here, tried to explain twice and still got no where.

I hope you have better luck... and maybe better review of this diveRead about the great pizza, out of town on business from Chicago. Saw they were open til 10pm, drove 20 minutes to get there, arrived at 8:40p only to be told that they didn't feel like making us a deep dish pizza because it took too long and we could get a thin crust instead. The restaurant was empty aside from us and we were shocked- who does that? They said they say they close at 10 but like to get out by 9/9:30. My advice? Call ahead to make sure they are even open or in the mood to make you a pizza. I mean, who does that???The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!

There is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.No customer service. No sense of urgency.  Was told by the manager of this place I was going to get a phone call back in 10 mins, that was a failure.  The longest 10mins of my life. Am yet to get a call back.I agree with Susan , I saw a Huffy bike for $200 yesterday , a dress for $100 and yes, the prices are way over priced and the 2 employees never greet you , the girl is always on her phone. I would fire all employees and hire honest friendly ones. There is never any good items , I believe one or some of the employees is working with an outside source to sell the valuable items like fine jewelry and antiques , there is never these items . This place should be shut down for good. 
 I hope God doesn't punish them for ripping people off and being money hungry.This is the first review we have ever written.  The experience we had was the worst we ever had, and felt it was needed to inform others, at least as a warning.  Yesterday we were waiting for La Piazza (if that is how it is spelt) to open for dinner, and we were starved.  So we crossed the street to have a little appetizer.  We ordered chicken wings.  

The discomfort set in when we watched the kid behinde the counter place the wings that looked like they were cooked yesterday, into an oven to warm them.  They were in there abour 4 minutes when he removed them, went into the back and came out a minute later with sauce on them.  I thought maybe they just prep them in the morning and store them well, so getting them ready when they are ordered is a little faster.  I'm actually ok with that.  We took our first bite, and realized it needed to exit our mouths quickly! The bitting and spitting into a napkin happened in sync.  The chicken was not only cold in the middle and burn on the outside.  It was the texture (and same moisture level) of old jerky.  I'm not kidding that these wings had to have been cooked at least 48 hours earlier than they were served, and left out on the side walk to dehydrate.  I'm not just saying that it was dry chicken.  This explanation is not exagerated.  I don't litterally think it was left on the side walk, but the chicken resembled what it would be if it had! 

We were so disturbed we left (after explaining the horror to the kid behinde the counter, and refusing our refund, just to leave as soon as possible).  

WORST EVER!!!  NEGATIVE 1000 STARS! I'm thinking of calling who ever needs to be called when a restaurant is serving harmful food.We use to go to Pete's all the time back in the day.  Haven't been in years so stopped by one Friday when I surprised the wife at work for lunch.  I should of kept driving.  Just nasty is all I can really say.  First off cash only, but no worry they have an ATM that charges you $3 for cash...Yeah that is pretty ghetto.  Well we order our fish and I was excited because Pete's was so good.  I was impressed by the prices, which should of been a clue.  Anyway, became annoyed that they charge extra for tarter sauce.   Anyway we got our meals.  I had the 1 piece fish and 4 piece shrimp.  The best way to sum this up is frozen overly processed fish.  Seriously Gorton's at the store is 10x better than this stuff.  Sad to see another Phoenix icon failing like Bill Johnson's.This place deserves nothing. I got house chicken and chicken fried rice. When I got home to mix the two I bit into it and found a thick sharp plastic!!!!! I didn't really care because I didn't swallow it no harm whatever. Called them to let them know. Or see if they can fix the problem for me because we are starving and find this crap in our food. Thinking they give us a new meal and a refund on the inconvenience and  apologize for the object they yelled at me! They yelled at me. Are you kidding me? told me if I wanted new food they wanted the old food in full. they asked me how much of it I ate. Making it seem like there doing me a favor. Wth no. I found a price of plastic that could've had me choke! I had to stop my meal to argue with these guys on the food for 20 minutes. To find out there's no way out of this. I hung up because I didn't care enough to argue in circles. But hey if you want A HUGE SHARP object in your food that the restaurant will blame you for then hey this is the place to go!!!Prices were great and the place clean but the bartender was rude, trashy and made the experience miserable. If Pfoxy Roxi is the best you can do there is no wonder why the place is slow. What a waste of time and money!The guy who works nights here is a real piece of shit. He just spent 5 minutes lecturing my friends on how American love is shallow and based on "fucky-fucky" and men should be worshipped by their wives "like Jesus Christ".As our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries. When the cashier was told about it, the reply was "he didn't know". Is it ok to eat other peoples food off of their trays and make excuses for it? Very disappointed.We (my boyfriend, son, & I) came here to grab some dinner, we wanted to try something new. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl without cabbage, my son got a kids meal BBQ chicken, and my boyfriend got the spam and eggs combo; it was outrageously expensive for the quantity/quality of food you get. The kids meal alone was over $5.50 and it doesn't even include a drink! My chicken had a lot of fat on it but the rice and chicken that wasn't fatty was very good. My son hardly ate any of his meal because the macaroni salad wasn't any good and the rice was burnt and my boyfriend agreed it didn't taste good. I don't think we will be coming back here again, wasn't worth the money. The restaurant also needs a remodel very badly, very run down and dirty.I have always shopped at Kohl's but I must say that I am dissatisfied with their customer service.  We registered at Kohl's for our wedding and we received several duplicate items. The customer service department would not allow us to get cash back with a gift receipt.  Our only options were to put the amount back on the gift giver's credit card or to receive a store credit.  I think people should be aware of this in case they register for big items like we did and then you end up with a lot of Kohl's merchandise credit.Everytime I go here, I leave telling myself that their [wash once and throw away quality] clothing and their incomparable high prices should be reminder enough not to return, but somehow I digress.  So on my last trip to Kohl's, Scott, my checkout cashier, greeted me with a monotone voice and flat affect. That coupled with the fact that he didn't know how to count back change [but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm] was the last straw! Terrible!  The store should be embarrassed. Please. Try to hire young employee's with even a little bit of professionalism.They really let me down....we have been a client at this Vet for a couple of years with our 2 dogs and 4 cats.  We take our pets for check ups and shots and havent had to go to them for an emergency.  Well an emergency came up.....my husband came home from work and found our elderly German Shepherd couldnt walk and the dog was very distressed.   We assumed he must have had a stroke or something.  While my husband was loading our dog into our car, I called Estrella Animal hospital to let them know we were coming in with an emergency and may have to put our dog down.    I was then told that it was a Friday and they are closing in 45 minutes and they could not see our dog.  I had explained we were regular clients, and also spoke with office mananager who told me the same thing.....I was shocked and greatly disappointed.   We were dealing with the potential loss of our beloved pet and were being told to take our dog elsewhere.  

Well Estrella refered us to Goodyear Animal Hospital which is actually closer to our house, who was able to see our dog immediately.    I am so disappointed in the Estrella but I do thank you for referring us to Goodyear Animal hospital who now will have the business of our other 5 animals and they will be continuning with the care of our German Shepard who has brain tumors.My husband used to go here for the Menudo on Sunday, he says it was as close to his Grandma's that he has had yet.

We no longer go here because of the health ratings that this place has had. They were almost shut down because it was so bad. Apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair. 

You can read the reports at http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=FoodIt's hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. I was very upset tonight when I ordered take out, the food was not good. Wont be going back!!Always hit and miss- but mostly miss

I rarely take the time on my days off from work to sit down for a large lunch in a good restaurant (I do for dinner). During lunch hour I am usually on a roll and I don't have the time for extended lunches.  With that in mind I am always searching for a good and quick place to eat. Unfortunately, Del Taco falls short. 


I have  said it many times before, I'm not a fan of Del Tacos food because their tacos do not have much filling in them, even when you order the double meat double cheese and the quality of food is always hit and miss.  However, my nephew enjoys the  food  at Del Taco so we decided to give it a shot. We decided to go through the drive thru.  I ordered two of the number six meals which included 2 double beef double cheese tacos, fries, and a drink.  I asked for the fries to be made "extra crispy" in hopes of getting fresh fries.  My hopes were crashed at least partially. As we pulled away I realized that one order of fries was fresh and hot while the other order was cold and stale. The frustrating thing beyond the cold fries was I asked the employee at the drive thru if the fries were fresh and extra crispy and she replied "yes".

The quality as a whole at Del Taco has seem to gone downhill fast.  I realize that Del Taco is a fast food establishment and fast food is what your going to get and I am fine with that. Howerever, I do believe the food should be fresh and made to order.  This doesn't appear to be the case with Del Taco. I have spoken to management on different occasions about the quality of food and have had meals replaced.

I will not be going back to Del Taco any time soon.This place is ridiculous!! $12.47 for a chocolate kiddie cone and a chocolate waffle cone and each had small scoops of some kind of apple pie ice cream. Keep in mind they won't tell you that you have to pay extra for the apples. Long story short.. Cold Stone blows!!I have been a long time weekly customer of this car wash. There have been a few instances where the wait was a little long.  However, today they lost a customer, "Me". I took my car for an oil change and wash to discover my IPOD was stolen from my center console. The first indication was when I turned my tuner back on and it stated, "No connection".  I quickly looked in the center console to discover it had been gone through and was a mess. There was a disconnected charger and no IPOD. I should have removed it from the car but on the other hand, I should not have to. I reported it to the manager and he could care less. He gave me a 10% discount card. How nice of him...Have had bad nail fills a few times.  Once, I had to return to get 3 or 4 nails re-done due to the owner having the girl rush thru my fill!  I do not like nail salons that are "nail factories" to see how many fills/pedicures they can get done in a day = Poor QualityI will admit that i've only been to Harold's once and it was enough. I was dragged there by friends. I'm not a beer drinker so I only ordered the beef ribs for dinner because they are less fatty than pork, and a diet soda. It was unbelievable what they served. The ribs were literally all fat. There wasn't an inch of real non-fat meat on any of the bones. It was totally inedible. I was incredulous. Harold's seems to have the attitude that they aren't interested in repeat business because Cave Creek is such a tourist haven during the winter. The only place that is worse than this, is The Tap Haus across the street.I thought by going to the Indian village I would get some great food. I have gotten their fry bread before and it was pretty tasty so I thought I would try something else. I went there with my friend. I got 2 chicken tacos and frybread with powdered sugar and honey and he got a vegetable,egg and cheese breakfast burrito. When we got the food it looked really appetizing. When we started to eat it was a different story...

The food was very bland...VERY BLAND. The chicken tacos had no seasoning or anything. The plate came with a side of salsa so I tried to use that to kick off the flavor. Didn't work. With no Tabasco or any other hot sauce I decided to just tough it out and finish my plate. My friends breakfast burrito was not impressive either. He had the same complaint of blandness. The fry bread was the only thing that was good. It was very inexpensive so I'm not too upset (both of our meals plus fry bread and drinks were 20$) but as a college student I would have liked to save the money or cooked something at home. 

I told my parents about the experience and they said it was hit or miss. So if you feel like taking a food gamble go to the Indian village. 


Also the service was at par. Nothing great but nothing awful.Outrageous prices!
Slow ass service!
Bland food!
Are you over 90 and some wealthy Scottsdale Snow Bird?  Hate food with flavor?  Want to sit around and complain all dinner long?  This is the place for you!I agree device is terrible food worse. This is all show but the show is not worth it. A tourist trap. Worst meal we had in a week at Care Free. Too many goog places for barbecue avoid this one.Plenty of Bull going on behind the scenes at this establishmentFood is not that great, service is poor, weird atmosphere. Pretty dark inside and feels kinda gross. I wouldn't suggest dinner here. My friends enjoyed the Bahama Mama cocktail.The most yuppiest biker bar in the valley.. They hate the locals in cave creek and only cater to the yuppie big wheel bagger crowd from phoenix, locals should not give this scumbag POS one single dime!!UGH!

Utter Disgust.

I recently moved to the Phoenix/West Valley area and as I'm driving around, looking for somewhere to eat, I see this hole-in-the-wall mexican drive-thru on the side of the road. Most of the best mexican food is found in some of the dirtiest, grimiest spots so I was all for tryin this place out... so I pull into the drive-thru and theres a guy standing outside, next to the menu, just staring at me. It takes me a minute to realize that he's going to be taking my order. That shoulda been a red flag but I ignored it, ordered my food and pulled up to the window. Waited a good 20 minutes... grrreeeeaaaat...... finally get my food (carne asada burrito & adobada fries) and I drive home. By the time I get home (about 10 minutes away), I pick  up my bag and theres a PUDDLE of grease sitting at the bottom of the bag. It literally had to be about 3/4 to a full CUP of grease!! SO GROSS! But i'm STARVING and i'm definitely not going to drive all the way back. So, I get rid of as much grease as possible and I eat the food. I had the fries. My wife had the burrito. Aside from the grease bomb that had exploded on my meal, I guess the food wasnt TOO horrible. Definitely not as good at Federico's or Filiberto's... but not HORRIBLE...

The next day, at work, I get this INTENSE stomach pain and knots in my belly. I end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad. I ended up vomiting VIOLENTLY for the next 24 hours. 

NEVER AGAIN!Probably the worst place I have ever walked into.

I would guess that the ONLY time you will ever walk in here is when you are half way to either San Diego or Arizona.  This town (if you can call it that) seems like nothing more than a pit stop for food and gas before your next one hour drive to civilization.

I walked in to what appeared to be a run down diner with a gift shop and a picture of a space ship on the wall.  By far the ONLY reason to walk in here is to get a picture of the space ship (you can see mine posted on Yelp).  I smiled, got my picture taken, and then drove straight to Taco Bell (probably the number one or two place to eat in this town).

I am sure you will do the same.

Please note:  I did not eat or try their food.  My review is based on the look and feel of the location.I have never filled out a Yelp review, but I feel everyone should know how terrible this place is. 
The first indication not to go in was he sign being off, wish we would have turned around then. But we gave the place a chance. We were asked what we wanted to drink before we had even seen a menu. Ordered ice tea and received a murky brownish water that hardly resembled tea. Then we were immediately asked what we wanted to eat. Obviously, having barely opened the menu, we nicely asked for a minute. 

20 minutes later, the waitress had made several rounds to the only 2 other occupied tables, and that's when we decided this place was not worth that kind of a wait, just to put an order in. So, we put $5 on the table for the half drank glass of tea, and we left.

Just as we stepped outside, we realized that no one deserved $5 for an awful glass of tea. So, one of us went back inside to removed the $5, hoping that would help them understand that they really need to work on customer service. Only to find out, in walking out the door and turning around, the  $5 had already been picked up. Had someone just been waiting for us to walk out so they didn't have to serve us?

Redeeming food service was quickly found at Burger King, just up the road. Burger King has a very friendly staff and they even changed part of my order with a smile on their face. 

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AT Space Age!!! GO TO Burger King, SERIOUSLY!!!Let's see, why not stop at the Burger King in the middle of nowhere?

* Service
* Flies
* Dirtiness

Wow. I wish we had stopped at McDonalds or just about anywhere else instead. When we walked in the dining room was staffed by what appeared to be the entire family of one of the employees. Kids, husband, grandparents, cousins. And they were all hanging out by the soda machine, blocking the only access to the front counter. But even if the family were there every time, the three reasons listed above would definitely keep me from visiting again.

Seriously, there are like two other restaurants within a few blocks. They really couldn't be any worse.This is the WORST Chinese restaurant I've ever been to in my life!!! I've never had seasame chicken that was yellow/white yuck!! Also they wouldn't give me a To go box the lo main tasted like straight pull I will not be be going back and in fact I'd I had money for a lawyer I would sue themEveryone's so nice. Our waitress was so friendly. 

But here's the thing...the food is disgusting. They give you free stale chips and salsa. In our group we had ordered tortas, camarones rancheros, and fish. The tortas were uh interesting to look at that's for sure, the bread was burnt and the meat was red..I've had tortas in the past plenty of times and I've never seen any like the one I had here, after we left the restaurant I was really scared I was going to get food poisoning. 

My brother had the fried fish..it was flavorless. Tasted like absolutely nothing. 

The camarones rancheros were the absolute worst. The situation was almost laughable because they were so bad. Camarones rancheros are usually spicy and flavorful. These were just cooked in tomato sauce and onion. That's it! No flavor at all. When I asked the waitress if they were supposed to be like this she said yeah and that these were the best, I knew she was lying. The rice and beans that came with it weren't good either. 

We half a** ate our food, we payed, we left. 

When we got in the car my little brother told us that when he went to the bathroom OUR waitress was in there cleaning the bathrooms, and she asked him to go under the stall and unlock it because it was locked from the inside. Why the freak was our waitress, the person that gave us our FOOD and DRINKS be cleaning the bathrooms?! Gross. AND why the freaking freak would she think it's appropriate to ask my younger brother to get on his hands and knees to get under the stall?!?!? I was just in shock. 

NEVER EVER going back. 

The only reason we went to this restaurant was because they had ok reviews on yelp but nope, I don't recommend it to anyone.I had a coupon for a $12 Mystic tan so I decided to give this salon a shot - that was a mistake!

I hadn't been tanning or spray tanned in quite a while so I was quite fair when I went in. I asked for the "light" option because I didn't want to end up orange or streaky (the options are light, medium, and max)...the employee told me that I should do the max option so that my tan would last longer. I expressed that I didn't want to end up orange or too dark and she told me that the different levels did not affect the tan color but rather only affected how long the tan lasted. She said that if I did the "light" option, my tan would be gone the next day. Against my better judgement, I agreed to do the "max" option because I figured she was the expert and knew what she was talking about.

Immediately after stepping out of the Mystic tanning booth, my worst fears were realized - I was already way too dark and streaky. I wiped off as much as I could after exiting the booth and ran home to take a shower and SCRUB off as much of the tan as possible. Thankfully most of it came off and I didn't have to walk around looking like a cast member of The Jersey Shore for a week.

I'm so disappointed that I wasted $20 on nothing and that the employee would try to up-sell me and convince me I needed the max even though she knew it would be too dark. I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere in the future.Carry out is a nightmare. First of all, you have to wait in the same line as the customers eating in. And with one register open? Your pizza is just sitting under a heat lamp an you can't do a thing about it but wait till the 5-6 people in line go throughout their ordering. This has happened to me more than once and it is very irritating.I was here Friday May 9th 2014. This is one of those place you can tell from the moment you walk in the door has a very cheep owner who takes no pride in ownership. From the old cracked celling tiles to the cheap art on the walls to the food (more on that later) to the old cheap broken down equipment behind the counter. The bathroom was gross dirty and smelled terrible! It's a seat yourself type of place so we saunter over to a booth and wait for someone to come check on us. 5 minutes go by and no one has check on us. So I walk up to the cash register and ask if we could get some service and I get a major attitude from the lady sitting back there. Before I could get back to my seat a nice woman was dropping off menus and taking our drink orders and saying how sorry she was about the delay. Fair enough things happen and she was very friendly! I order a coke and water with lemon and my friend orders an iced tea with lemon. When we get our drinks the 1st thing we both notice is the brown spots on the lemons. When we ask about fresh lemons she says they all pretty much look like that. So my friend ordered the burger and the waitress asked if he wanted French fries he said yes. I ordered the grilled salmon with a salad fries and veggis. When the waitress brought me my salad I though it was a joke. GROSS GROSS GROSS! The lettuce was wilted and the tomato looked freeze dried. I could not believe that this was what passed for a salad around this place!!!! I mean the lettuce was seriously BROWN!!! UGH! I ask if they maybe had something fresher and she said that this is how the lettuce looked! OMG! REALLY?!?!? God I still can't believe it! So here comes our meal. My salmon was dry and bland! My friends was about on par with one you'd get from McDonalds. Nothing real bad just not something homemade. Then the bill comes. There was a charge for my friends fries. Who the hell sells and hamburger A la carte?
So over all we were not impressed with any of it! The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks refilled so that was good. It's just one of those places you can tell the owner wants to do things as cheep a possible and is not worried about quality! I really hate to say this because I love to support local businesses but just do yourself a favor and go to the Denny's on Grand.I would not recommend eating at the Peoria Cafe. I ordered two pancakes and bacon for my breakfast. The bacon was nice and crispy like I ordered, however the pancakes were tasteless. 

When I poured the syrup onto my plate from the container sitting on the table, to my surprise a large fly came out in the syrup! Disgusting! The rest of my friends refused to eat after seeing this. The waitress took the plate and the syrup from the table and apologized. We all left and will not be returning to the Peoria Cafe. The back door was open and there were also bugs flying around. I'm not sure if you can attach a picture to this, but I will if I can.I have never ordered a chicken gyro and received something so disgusting. The "chicken" was a flattened hunk of mystery meat. It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers. 

There was no way it was going in my mouth. 

I pulled it out and then tried to eat the--now veggie--gyro. It was still awful. The tzatziki sauce was so bland it could have been water. The pita itself was nothing special. And the water from the soda fountain dispenser tasted worse than tap.Had the grandparents over from out of town and I was looking for somewhere not too pricey but decent eats. This place was not it for sure. They sat us way in the back near the kitchen and bathrooms when the entire place was empty. Their food selection was poor, almost everything was fried. The place looked run down and lightning was horrible. We will never return to King Buffet.I placed a carry out order got all the way there to pick it up and was told they didn't have crust. Really you're a Pizza Hut. There was no one manager there to talk to I will be calling back on Monday after 4 as Terrance told me. Very disappointed and will make the extra drive from now on. At least I will get to deal with professionals that dare about there brand.The pizza itself is pretty good,  but the delivery service is terrible. They are always late showing up.  Last week I ordered 2 pizzas for my family an hour and a half before we had to leave the houseand was govern an eta of 45 minutes.  1 hour and 5 minutes later they finally got there.  I called to complain since we had enough time to pay for the pizza and set it on The counter before leaving. No one had a chance to eat. I was told they were short handed and they were sorry and would credit my account so I could get free pizza next time. Fine. 

So today I called at 1030 to order my pizza and was told they would be here at 1145 - probably giving me a long estimate because it's Friday and they know they were late last time.  This time they show up at 1205...unbelievable.  we're never ordering from pizza hut again.Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction, you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too.We went there last night because my mother lives by there and wanted to try it.  Cute when we first walked in and sat down.   Pretty crowded..... bar was packed.  

Our food was VERY sub- par and i had the WORST  spagetti  with meat sauce ive ever had!   Everyone at my table thought it was disgusting so it wasnt just me

the drinks are not cheap at all for being in a strip mall next to the Dollar Store... Seems like  they are ripping Sun City people off.  My friend had sausage and peppers in a very small bowl for $13 and he said it wasnt very good either

Salad looks like  it came of of one of those salad bags at a grocery store 

The only reason I gave it one star is because the bar area looked fun.......

Everyone in my group said to give them zero Stars!!!!!!!Eww! Food was bland and tasteless and the service was slower than molasses on a cold winter's day. Took us nearly an hour to get our food only to be disappointed. I don't see the hype here. This place sucks. Don't eat here! Unless of course you don't have taste buds then you won't care.a month or so ago on a Sunday morning, I was in the mood for a patty melt. it was good, no complaints. decent service, etc. a few days ago I was in the mood for breakfast. the iced tea tasted like spinach for some bizarre reason (perhaps it was stirred with the same spoon they used to stir spinach?) and the hash browns tasted like they had fallen into dirty dishwater and retrieved, towel blotted and placed on my plate. the eggs were rubbery. the only edible thing on my plate was the 1/2 slice of ham. the server was perplexed when I asked if they served butter or margarine/county crock and told me she wasn't sure but that it came in a "square". when my food arrived, the "butter" was just a sliced pat of "whatever" with what appeared to be a gritty substance on it. it was not in a foil wrapper as one may see in a restaurant. I immediately pushed the toast and unidentified square of who-knows-what aside. I spent $6 for a meal of which only 20% was edible. In a word, my breakfast experience at Bobbie's Café was HORRIBLE.I don't like to trash restaurants either but 2 times here was two times too many.  Dinner was forgettable at best (a plastic container with canned fruit cocktail?really?).  Breakfast was ever worse! Have they heard of HOT coffee? How many times do you have to ask for cream? When you order a bacon & cheese omelet, who the heck just lays 2 pieces of whole bacon in the omelet & just folds it over AND then doesn't bother to finish cooking the omelet?  Greasy overcooked hashbrowns, toast drowning in butter & that godawful fruit cocktail again. This place is a heartattack on a plate.  Service is HORRID! The over 75 crowd that frequents this place has obviously decided they don't deserve good, fresh & tasty food and has just given in to CHEAP.  How does a place like this stay in business?this business is closed permanently!!This place has really gone down hill over the years.  Every now and then I will give them a chance to redeem themselves and every time they have shit the bed.  Super Nachos and Carne Asada Fries, simple enough, right?  Wrong.  Both looked disgusting and had only a few crumbles of carne.  Their Green Chili Burrito?  I don't even know what to call the concoction they created, but it certainly was not a Green Chili burrito.  It seemed as though they simply slapped some beans in a tortilla, tossed in a few crumbles of carne from the previously mentioned fries and nachos, and topped it off with some of their mediocre salsa.  Wait... that's  exactly what they did.

If they get another chance from me it will be because someone else is buying, and when it sucks again I will not be surprised.Very busy, some of the employees are rude and my hubby needed some asthma pills which they have a card you have to give the pharmacy and they lady was well not very smart.....My Waffle House excursion was the result of jokingly saying "Let's go there" and then somehow being taken seriously. Literally feet from the front door and I was ready to turn around. In case you were wondering what happened to the cast of Dangerous Minds with Michelle Pfeifer and Coolio, look no further; I've found them. 

After about ten minutes of trying not to stick to the menus, our waitress walked over and said "You ready?" But I wasn't ready because I was too busy trying to figure out what on the menu couldn't be made by a five-year-old with an EZ-Bake oven. Everything is a variation of grilled cheese, except for the waffles which I daringly tried because the pictured portion looked plentiful and I figure, if I have to go to a Waffle House, might as well try the namesake. 

After what I can only imagine was five minutes spent microwaving a frozen waffle, I was given a plate of grid-like moosh and a plastic packet of butter resting atop it. I HATE when people put things that they've touched with their hands on my food, but at this point I just wanted to eat and leave before the utter disdain imprinted on my face upset one of the Wrestlemania fans sitting behind me.

I can't NOT recommend this place enough. It's on par with Denny's in terms of pricing, but you don't even get what you pay for. And you might get stabbed.Just tried to eat an order I picked up fom Nan Jing.  I can unequivocally state that this was the worst Asian food I have ever tried to eat.  If I had not been famished, I would have thrown this gruel away and gone to Jacks.  All because I was too lazy to drive the 2 additional miles to Saigon Kitchen.  I will not set foot or tongue in this place again and you shouldn't either.Terrible, terrible service, ....hey.. Thanks Beth!! I'm not coming back. There are too many good restaurants in this area to put up with poor service and management that is to arrogant to make sure their dinners enjoy their meal and evening,.I tried this one a few times because it is close to home. It has been very inconsistent, but no better than ordinary. Last time the meal was very poorly prepared. This is  the worst Italian I can remember. I think it survives only because there are few easy places to get to this far north.Went in for a pedi and a girl named Rosie took my hand and said you need a Mani on a week old fullest of gels she did a week ago. I thought cool $ 15 and she'll fix them since their uneven. I kept asking her why she wants to soak them in actone she claim she had to and as my nails fell off she claims I'm giving you a mani I told her that not what I asked for she refused to talked to me and yelled for David and he said I asked her to remove them. They were both rude and had all the staff looking at me weird. The owner offered to give me a $10 discount of a new set..I paid for my wonderful pedi and left nail less and disappointed.Quality has really gone down. You won't get what you pay for. Save your money, do it yourself! Left my emergency break up did not bother to put it down.UGGGGHHHH! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! After the new year they got new management and all new employess. The food was absolutely terrible. They are now the "New Chen Wok" and they suck so hard. The soup was like jelly. The rice- crunchy not done. Where the hell is the flavor????? Gone. Very upsetting. I've been going there for three years. I even called and told them off. Lost this customer for sure. That's just too bad.  Anybody know where the old owners went? I'd like to find them.So tired and disappointed by the right wing comments and obvious political agenda. Makes me sad to the bone because all i want is to be taught the bible's message. Didn't know that being a christian also meant being a republican.Worst gas stop in 2000 miles.  Filthy building, locked bathrooms out back, surly distracted staff, stupid placement of air pump in the far corner of the parking lot.  Avoid.My wife went on a bus tour which stopped here for lunch and I thought it was a joke when we pulled in, but we figured we could give the buffet a shot.  While waiting in line we noticed two things: 1 was that the buffet was normally $7 and that today happened to be asian theme day.  I got the orange chicken, pot stickers, and pork fried rice...and took one bite from each..and about died from an overdose of sodium.  Overall the food was so salty and mushy it was unedible.  My wife opted to give the salad bar a shot, which was fine till she tried the carrot stick which was mushy on the outside but still frozen rock hard on the inside.  We decided dessert was probably the safest thing to try, so we grabbed a pecan pie, and a brownie...how bad can that be right...Well the pecan pie resembled the carrot, extremely mushy on the outside and frozen solid on the inside.  The brownie was edible, but not by much.  After lunch we still had over an hour to kill at the casino, so my wife and i dropped $5 each into the penny slots and  played for as long as we could while being overwhelmed by cigarette smoke.  We ended up just waiting outside for the last half hour.This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to.

Yes, there ARE better McD's out there. Like the one on Boulder Highway by Joker's Wild, right before you hit Warm Springs.

I have visited the last two nights here....Because I was picking up a friend of mine who got off from work, and we had a sweet tooth.....along with my family members at the house.

Yesterday, we pull up and ask for hot fudge sundaes. 
Ice cream machine is out.

Instead, we get two large sweet teas.....Which were overly sweet. Almost...gave off a syrup feel after I swallowed.

Tonight, the ice cream machine IS working, so I get two sundaes, and of course, two large sweet teas.

Sundaes look sad, because they are not in their proper clear plastic cup...they are instead in mini McFlurry cups....(not even filled completely, might I add.)

My friend and I take one sip of our sweet teas....and they taste like dirty water.
It's almost like they were trying to trick us.....Like, they didn't have enough tea, so they filled 3/4 of the cup with water.... Seriously, if I wanted the taste of unfiltered water, I would just pick up a hose out of someone's back yard. 

The women who work here, hate their lives. I mean, they are just wretched.
One of the cars parked by the drive thru was.....vandalized with shaving cream, and what appeared to be eggs... Can't say I blame the perpitrator when these ladies can't even pour a glass of tea. .....I don't condone it, but hey, some people are crazy about their food.Went here with some fiends we were desperate looking for a place to stay and decided to go here.  Wasn't bad but the security ket harrassing me the whole time which was a really big turn off.  Never been harrassed by a security guard in my entire life and I have been to every hotel in Vegas.  This white dork with glasses was just really bored and had drank way to much coffee or taken too much speed and would not leave us alone.  I fianlly had to complain to the front desk.  The guy even asked me what room i was staying in.  First he goes you can't walk around with your shirt un buttoned then we went to the pool at like 8pm and hes like the pools closed get out now and was totall dick about it, then he tried to follow us to our rooms, CREEEEPO!!!! dont go ehre the security is on tweek or something complete freaks sorry fiesta but you suuuuck!We stayed 2 nights. While this is an older hotel, it seemed to be clean. Upon arriving to our room I checked the bed & surrounding areas for bed bugs as I have heard the stories about hotel rooms. I didn't look hard enough or just missed them all together. The first night I was bit 4 times on my chest and the second night 9 times on my back. Had I realized they were bed bug bites after the first night I would have left. After being home for almost a week I have had no further bites and hope we didn't bring any home with us. While I had no issues with the staff I will never return to this Station propertyTonite at the drive thru they gave me a baked potato that looked terrible and smelled worse ! totally unedible. Last week they gave me the right salad but no dressing! I'll find another one to go to from now on. Hope management is smart enough to read these.0 stars if I could. The atmosphere is terrible I feel like I am going to get lung cancer the second I walk in. The main problem I had was at the mess up on my order and then they charge me extra for messing up on my order I will never come back and I would strongly suggest avoid this place at all cost.Walked in here during the Super Run on Water Street and received a Special Super Run Menu. We paid $47 for 2 meals with 2 beers. Side of salsa = $5. Soda = $4. Don't know the remainder of the pricing because they don't present an itemized check. Paid with $60 and they did not offer change. When asked about the pricing, they flipped the closed sign and shut the door. This place is trying to collect all they can now and they don't care about their future. I will not return!First time here, and the service was bad, they forgot to put our Oder in and that's only because we asked if it would be ready soon, this was 40 min later, never once came to our table to see if we needed refills or if everything was okay, never again will I come hereThere's no way this place is worthy of five stars. Maybe the owner knows the reviewer. Understocked, and more importantly NO SOAP DISPENSER IN THE MENS BATHROOM! How are the employees supposed to thoroughly wash their hands and go back to their amazing job of, yeah, working at WalMart?All I can say is......Don't go to this florist located at 338 S Water St. in Henderson, NV. I sent a dozen roses to someone and they were half dead when delivered, the bottoms of every single rose was brown from 2 inches down to the ends!  Then they charges me $10 for a business card that read who the roses were for and from!  Not to mention a $25 delivery fee!!!  On top of $100 for the rotten roses that never opened up and were completely dead within 2 days!  Also they charged my credit card...then didn't even delivery the flowers till 2 days later!  I seriously could have gotten better roses at the grocery store!  This place isn't professional at all, and the people than run it are very dishonest!  Again....this store is located at 338 S Water Street in Henderson, NV!!!!!What an excuse for a store! I had a terrible experience! First thing I saw when I walked in was a fat lady with brown hair yelling at an employee about not getting enough rewards cards and he was on the verge of crying. Who would shop at a place where the managers are so awful to their employees?? I proceeded to look for my items, which they didn't have, and one of the employees (Stephen I think) was terribly rude! And once I got to checkout, the checker (Gary) bombarded me with question after question. So I  grabbed my things before he could check them and moved to another line. I got Nick at register 3. Going through his line was the ONLY good part of my experience at Kmart. He was very nice and we even struck up a conversation. He asked me ONE time about my rewards card, and when I said no, he didn't ask me any more questions. It was a relief! I will NEVER shop there again, because I heard he was let go and I would rather brave Walmart than go through Gary's line. Plus, that boss of their's is awful. Save your time and patience, don't shop at the Racetrack Kmart.Why do I go here - because it is the closest to my home.  Why bother here anymore.  Running late from work picked up the family and we came thorugh drive-through around 6:30PM with NO ONE else in line in Drive through.  The F-T-F service we were stuck with some one new learning the cash register (I am patient - everyone needs to learn)  I can hear throught the window the employees goofing off singing and laughing really loud and no one helping this cashier out.  Three of us ordered.  Out of three only my daughter's happy meal order was correct.  I asked for no mayo they gave it to me, my husband asked for no pickles and they gave it to him and I wanted a large chocolate milkshake and they gave me a medium.  I even said I ordered a large and the girls response was "well, it says medium".  She gives me the drinks first WITHOUT straws and gives me the bag of food WITHOUT ketchup.  I ask is the straws in the bag her response "I don't know I don't bag them I just hand them to you" - I look at her and say "Well, can I get straws?"  And then the same question about the ketchup "Well, can I get ketchup?"  When we got home and the order was incorrect I was pissed.  I really think they didn't want to make a fresh order and knew that we would be forced to eat it since it was ordered through drive through.  What is up with promoting F-T-F service - Everything about this locations sucks!  I think it is time for us to get healthy and go to Tropical Smoothie which has healthy items and for kids too.After our elderly cat stopped eating and drinking water for a couple of days we took him to VCA.  Paid $230 for blood test and urine analysis, which after taking our cat to two other vets, it was a complete rip off!  That $230 included a "free" exam.  Oh, and they tried to bill us for the "free" exam and had them take it off our bill.

The vet said they were going to call us the next day to inform us about our cat's blood and urine results.  Around noon the next day we didn't get a call so we called them.  The receptionist said the vet was busy and she will call us back in an hour.  THREE hours went by, so around 3:00pm we called AGAIN.  The receptionist said the vet will call us back at 5:00pm.  Well at 4:55pm, we still didn't get a call.  Third time's the charm right?  We finally were able to speak to the vet!

If the above reasons haven't convinced you yet, keep reading...

The vet's diagnosis was that our cat was being picky with his food and recommended that we experiment with different types of food.  No hydration shot or medication for our cat, just experiment with different types of food.  All that for $230!  

After experimenting with various foods, our cat still wouldn't eat or drink and he only got worse.  We took him to Oasis for a second opinion and after conducting a ultrasound, the vet could see masses in our cat's stomach and pancreas.  We definitely wasn't expecting such heavy news.  What's worse is that VCA MISDIAGNOSED our elderly cat and only prolonged his suffering.  If we didn't get a second opinion, our cat would have probably died from liver disease.  

Our experience at VCA is the epitome of veterinary malpractice; misdiagnosing and overcharging.Food is terrible, complete lack of flavor. Didn't even get cherries in my cherry limeade!I have been eating at this Villa Pizza for over 14 years. (They recently relocated). The owners have always been nice people and even though the pizza is a little over priced I enjoy it. When you pay 
$40 for a large cheese pizza and 15 fingers, you expect them to be good. I've never had an issue until today. I ordered delivery from this Villa (Cheese Pizza and fingers/hot.) It took almost 50 minutes to get here. which was fine...but when it got here the pizza was barely warm and the fingers looked like they had barely drizzled hot sauce on them. Usually they come doused in the sauce and they are hot and fresh. I was really upset considering I also tipped $6 to the driver. Since I've been a patron of theirs for years I decided to call and let them know my dissatisfaction. The owner's wife answered the phone. I explained to her the situation in a calm manner. She said that they took the pizza right out of the oven and delivered it. Which could possibly be true. I am sure they delivered several orders on the way to mine. She also stated that their chicken soaks up the sauce. I've ordered this exact meal several times and never had it in that condition. When I explained it to her, she got flustered and handed the phone to her husband. He then proceeded to yell at me and tell me that I was wrong. I was extremely offended and told him that I have ordered from them for 14 years. He said he would send me a fixed order. I told him it was not necessary but that I just wanted him to acknowledge that it was poor. He said he was sending a fixed order and that I didn't need to order from him ever again. 
I was completely offended. I could not believe that after eating there and ordering food to go for over 14 years that I would be treated so poorly. I can honestly say I will never order from them again as I refuse to support any business, small or large that would yell at customers like that. I am afraid to eat what they brought to "replace" the order as I fear it could be "compromised." I am so disappointed, to say the least that any business would treat customers that way. I will NEVER eat or order from this Villa Pizza again.At bar by poker room and bar person leaves for a meeting at 2 pm for 24 minutes no drinks we served in entire casino due to meeting.  I ask two people one in a suit and tie for drink but no help. Bad planning shutting down all bars for 24 minutes for a meeting.Ugh. Dear Colonel Sanders. It's a shame your ghost can't come back and give the franchisee of this KFC location a good swift kick in the derriere. I walked in here and noted that the place was cleaner than most KFC's typically are. But a clean restaurant doesn't equal good food, or a good value either. When we opened up our takeout food it was woefully disappointing and underwhelming in terms of quantity and taste. 

I've stayed away from KFC restaurants for several years but when my wife said she wanted KFC, I went. I regret not telling her no. I flat refuse to go back to this KFC, and it will likely be many years if ever before I step foot in ANY KFC again. 

1 Star is 1 Star too many.The food is great but I can not stand the guy who is behind the counter taking orders and money. He never smiles, he has a horrible attitude and treats the employees likes slaves.

I will never return to this place if this man is behind the counter. One day I went in to pick up carry out and the place was packed, there was not a seat available and of course the man with the horrible attitude is there being bashful and not welcoming at all. At this point Ive figured out that he is the owner, if you're the owner with an attitude like that please stay home and let the girls that work there run the place, at least they smile and are friendly, this guy needs an attitude adjustment!!!!!Just to set the record straight, Mr. Adam's posts my name on his comments (without my permission) regarding my review due to the fact I had completed the demographics on his work order before I left. I have, as most of you have, signed work orders to have services completed. The chaos came from no one knowing why I was present nor what work was to be done despite my thirty minute call and scheduled appointment, as you pointed out. My cell phone was ringing as my ride was calling to pick me up at the shop so I could leave my vehicle. If you need a good laugh check out the sudden plethora of good reviews after I posted. Mr. Adams may have a great product, I don't know, I'm just sharing my experience. A simple apology would have sufficed but that is not in the Adam's customer relations handbook.Stay away!  My room reeked of cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be non-smoking.  I couldn't sleep there but was told no other rooms available.  Guy at front desk was kind enough to cancel my room so I could go elsewhere.  But days later management charged me for room anyway!  Stay away!They are the worst service I've ever dealt with, they don't even deserve one star. They lied to me when I signed up. I signed up for a yucca injection for my plants,  which was twice a year and then an organic fertilizing twice a year. They started to bill me every mouth after that for services I never agreed to, such as watering my shrubs.  I have a drip system never asked for that. Then pest control was my next bill, I've been using the same pest service for years. Guardian Pest Control this company is the best ever!  The yucca injections  killed 4 passion fruit vines & none of my fruit trees produced this year. Their service is a rip off.  they keep calling me and harassing me about a bill that was to be adjusted by the management. Every time I talk to customer service their kind and say they'll take care of it, but then I'll get another call in a few weeks. I've cancelled all my services with them.Don't come to this snobbish place. They do not want to help you out unless you are going to wear a suit going in. They will ignore you, unless you walk in with a suit. For some reason, the sale associate thinks they all make seven figures and too good to help someone out.I went in to have an xray done. The told me I needed a crown When I went to have a crown put on they told me they can now do 1 day crowns. I agreed to that, that way I don't have to come back. When they put the prep on my gum they started to press heavily on my gum. It completely irritated the gum. Dr. Chase told me the pain was temporary. Well, it's 16 days later .I still have the pain and now they informed me I will need a double root canal. Why did this not show up on the original xrays. . Now they are unable to work on my tooth because the pain is so intense, so they sent me to a specialist on the other side of town. another they told me they would not do any of the work unless I paid in full, 1137.00. When I told them I'll pay half today, because I wanted to see if they could do this job properlythey told me aI had to pay full or they would not do any of the work. Stay away from this placethe food quality is not consistent. the wait is oh so looooonnnggg, every single time. once, i called in my order and gave them 45 minutes to prepare my food, and when i arrived at the restaurant, i waited another 20 minutes. and while i paid as soon as i got there, i was asked by staff if i had already paid before handing me my food. today will be the last time i set my foot here, because you made me wait again...oh jasmine express, you keep breaking my heart!I have to write a review for this place because there are so many high reviews that I think they must be fake. I'm not a picky person, but the food that I got was bad. I got the Korean barbeque ribs and I couldn't even cut through them with a knife. They were all fat and hardly any meat. I don't like how there's no one in the restaurant to greet people when they come in. The girls go in the kitchen and even though the door makes a noise when someone comes in, no one comes out and they end up standing there awkwardly and waiting like 10 minutes. It made me feel uncomfortable when two separate customers came in and waited like that and started getting mad when no one came to them. The restaurant also doesn't seem clean. I went in the bathroom and it was dirtier looking than a gas station bathroom. There was no soap or paper towels at all. This was probably one of the worst restaurants I've been to (although the waitress we had, a little girl who looked like she's probably in high school, was really nice).Was craving pho wasn't really in the mood to drive all the way across town so I decided to give this place a try...but this has to be the most disgusting experience I've had at a restaurant!!! The noodles in the phó were hard as a rock...and the sprouts were brown!! And the broth..i can't even describe how bad it was it all lacked flavor!! this place needs some serious help! Do yourselves a favor and never eat here!!What a f#@king dump... and the managers are a joke.I showed up for happy hour, but it was nothing of the sort.  I ordered a beer and watched as the bartender filled a pitcher with foam which sat and reduced to about 2 inches of beer after a few minutes at which time the process was repeated.  I was informed that the taps were improperly calibrated which caused them to foam excessively.  Then she said that she was not allowed to pour out the foam because it wastes beer.  In the end, after about 10 minutes, I received a flat beer.  Are you f'kin kidding me??  You cheap m'fers!!  I will never return because of your idiocy.I ordered the french onion soup, 12oz strip steak med-rare with mushrooms/onions and extra broccoli.

The steak was almost flavorless, the broccoli was waaay overcooked and yet somehow served cold, and the french onion soup tasted like beef bullion with extra salt.

I had a 25$ giftcard so I paid $1.62 and I still feel ripped off.

When my son brings home those flyers from school where applebees donates a percentage of your bill to the school... I'm going to give his teacher 10$ and stay home for dinner.Would not recommend this particular Applebees to anyone. Me and my family ordered food. My cousin and I ordered pasta and it was supposed to come with bread. They forgot that. Finished our pasta and still no bread. Also our appetizers were chips and salsa along with some spinach dip. They brought out a small plate knowing there were six of us. How were we going to eat the chips and dip? Pour the dip in our hands and dip the chip into our palm? My cousins wife's drink was done sort of Sangria with cranberry in it. She took one sip and realized how disgusting it was. The floor manager nor two orlther waitresses noticed we were missing more plates, bread for the pasta and that the big sangria drink was still full. This was a slow Sunday night by the way. It was barely even busy. I would not recommend this place. Perhaps Chilis or another similar type restaurant or different Applebees would be your best bet.Well, considering I came from and returned to MSP International (Lindbergh terminal), I'm surprized at how sparse this place feels.  And I'm disappointed.  There is no map/directory, so I had no idea what food was available, but there's room for slot machines (must be in Las Vegas or something).  We asked at the US Airways customer service desk, and she directed us to FlatBreadz -- which both my wife and I disliked.  The food we wanted wasn't available, the service was crummy and the food was not much better.

I guess as an aiport it works -- we were able to fly out, but it sure doesn't seem like a place to visit, or shop, or eat, or just about anything else...Fuck you. That's all I have to say. Worst airport experience ever. Everyone was slow and rude. Nothing makes me want to go back home quicker.One of my least favourite airports any where.  For such a busy airport it lakes almost no dining choices beyond fast food.  There is nearly no shopping options.  The airport design is pretty haggard and outmoded.  The walls on its many hallways are benign.  Apparently the airport authority has never heard of art work or at least windows at a viewing level for natural sunlight in many of the dullest parts of the airport.Watch your items at the security station.  I had a Venetian mask stolen at the security point.  They stopped my friend which was in front of me and then took my bag back through the machine - which only had a purse, sweater, and the mask.  I was being really careful with it so when it finally came back through I opened the bag and it was gone.  I reported it and ask for them to go through the tape, but of course it was gone.  So....be careful.  Shame on them that is the last place you should see that happen.This has to be the worst airport I ever been too. It looks like everyone here hates their job. Anytime I ask anybody for service or question I get a sarcastic rude answer. I don't know what to make of it. Should I get offended and ask what their problem is or brush it off. Just don't expect any type of good customer service. On top of everything our flight was delayed 1.5 hours and the alarm keeps going off making sirens throughout the airport. And when we asked a worker here she said it happens all the time. Good thing I had such a great time on my vacation I'm not gonna let this place ruin it for me.Do not even think  about it. After seeing tv ads decided to try the chicken. Wrong, dry, old but the staff was having was having a great  time, quality was not a concern.Nothing compared to O'Hare.  This place was busy, but that's no excuse not to be clean.  I used two of the nastiest bathrooms I've ever seen while waiting on my flight (my husband said the men's bathroom was equally bad) . 

And what kind of an airport doesn't have a McDonald's?!?  Everything was WAAAAY over priced (food wise, $11 for a cold cut prepackaged sandwich!). Give me a break!  

Won't be flying through here again unless I don't have another option.The only reason I give it a star is for terminal 3 and the D gates. Beware if you need to go to the A/B gates!  Security lines are a mile long and the employee/wheelchair line usually has 18,000 wheelchairs trying to get through!  I have seen flight crews have to stand behind  all of the wheelchairs! Absolutely INSANE!!!!!!!! Once you FINALLY get through security, you are welcomed to a very  outdated and old school airport...carpets are dingy, the gate areas smell of stale smoke embedded into the walls and carpets, the moving walkway (when it's working!) is so narrow, people never realize that there is a "WALK" and "STAND" section, passengers do not realize that they are not supposed to have wheelchairs on the moving walkway...I have already witnessed a couple of people in wheelchairs fall flat onto their face when they reach the end of the walkway....this not only creates a hazard to the people in the wheelchairs, but also to those behind them....as a catastrophic domino effect can occur....!!! I hope the county can handle the lawsuits!!!  Also, the restrooms by the A gates are always shut down and dining choices are very limited! Very poorly maintained terminal for a big city like Vegas. Not to mention the zero level area where they pick up and drop off tour groups and limos smells like an elephant/gorilla exhibit in a zoo...apparently, due to the fact all the trash dumpsters are located there!!!! Welcome to Vegas!!!!!! That smell just slaps you in the face!!!!!!!!!!!If I could give negative stars with regards to Southwest's service and professional competence I would. I have suffered multiple hours of delays, been bumped off flights, and been subjected to countless hours of frustration at the hands of this company with no compassion. I have been flying with them for years because of the lack of alternatives. This lack of alternatives is something they seem to be painfully well aware of.  Expect the perfect storm of incompetence whenever you are forced to fly Southwest. If given the choice, choose ANY other airline.If you ever think about taking Southwest Airlines out of Las Vegas please rethink your decision.  This is the second time with delays flying in and out. Not sure if Southwest Airlines is the red headed stepchild in Las Vegas or the sheer volume of flights is too much for the airlines.  This trip started at 11:45 at 5:00 we are still in the airport because of 1) our airport has low cloud issue for flying in 2) we waited long enough for a storm to hit Las Vegas 3) after being in the q for take off returned to terminal for a new captain? 4) once at the terminal we are now grounded because of lighting 5) what next?This place is ridiculous. It took the stoner dude behind the counter about 10 minutes to make a sandwich. The only other person working just kind of moves things, from place to place, and heats things in a microwave. I ordered hot tea and a sandwich and it was almost $12! It's ridiculous!Have been here multiple times in hopes they get better but they don't. 3 out of 3 times messed my order up. Unfortunately they are closest Einstein's to me so in stuck. I have been to others and they are much faster and don't tend to mess up orders quite like this location.The only reason why I'm giving Aloha Specialty a 1 star is because of one waitress that waited on us on April 6 right before closing.  Don't get me wrong, the food is AWESOME, but the lack of service this one waitress didn't give us did not sit well for a party of 6.  Especially when we have 3 first timers that drove 10 hours to get some great tasting food.  I too am in the service industry, but the way this waitress acted was totally unacceptable and if she worked for me, I would TERMINATE her for her lack of customer service skills.  I didn't get her name, but she had long hair and looked Hawaiian.  To management, she's detrimental to your business.Don't understand the good reviews......we trusted them and was totally disappointed.  Such bland food; We ordered the local plate and the teri plate - bummed there was no rice on the local plate, dikon was dried out, the beef was chewy and tough, chicken was just edible.  Only complaint on the teri plate was again, the lack of flavor.  The Saimin was a disappointment as well, the char su pork was tough and chewy, and tasted like pork soaked in water.  I didn't eat much more than a dozen bites...just kinda gross.  

As we got up to leave I noticed the couple that had been in line before us left their plates practically full on their table too.....food left on plates is not a good sign.

Go back to search now....Really really really wanted to eat here for a while and stood in line for a while but got to check out the menu while doing so. When we finally ordered, I handed over my debit card but was refused because guess what? Cash Only. There was not a single sign or anything in the entire place. So we just left. Really? Cash only in a casino? Fail.I don't usually do cheap...but got talked into staying here by friends. If you like your feet to stick to the floor, holes in you rooms walls, and lots and lots of noise in your room at night from thin walls and slamming doors, this is the place for you! Never saw anyone win at slots here - actually didn't see that many people even playing slots here. However, the table games are plentiful. There is a deli that's like an old fashion dime store counter where the food is halfway decent and cheap. But they won't even charge to your room. Who does that??? This place is just seedy. It is cheap, but you get what you pay for! And dirty....soooo dirty.Please please please, do not waste your time and money dealing with this wicked evil people.
I called the over a year ago first time just to get more info on their service. I didn't hire them then, but woman ARORA was calling us back every other week. So when the urgency to fix my husband's 3 year old ticket came, I called them back. And same woman was extremely nice and gave me 60$ discount (yeah right!). So their price supposedly came down to $200.
I asked her if I will have to pay anything else after I pay them $200. She said "no", I only pay $200 and the problem is solved. It was my first time, I was naive and paid my last $200 of my two credit cards. Need to say, original total fir the ticket was $550.
Afterwards I read bad reviews, I called a week later to see how my case was doing, she was extremely rude and talked to me in a way like "I just told u!" and etc.
So later I saw the changes on citation online and the new total was $440!
Then my husband called and tried calmly to explain her we were not pleased with service, she denied all her previous words of course and hung up.
I complained with BBB, but obviously they don't care as long as they can catch stupid naive ppl like me and give them $200 for almost nothing.
Now we ended up spending more than initially which is $440+$200. Do the math.I came in here around 1230 and I was looking at a Silver Eagle.  The e owner quoted me over double the silver value for it and when I asked if he could drop the price he got rude and started saying to get out of the store. I've never encountered such a rude store owner and I for sure will never go back**HOTEL REVIEW**

Got a free room so wanted to check it out. Asked for an upgrade to one of their newer rooms but was denied. I remember during the Yelp Spring Break we had a tour of the suites and it was really nice so I thought maybe the rooms would be similar. The furnitures in the rooms were new and good, but man.. everything else screamed ghetto. The bathrooms were old and the showers felt like I was at a gym. I had to wear sandals while showering because the floors looks disgusting. It is also very noisy and you can hear everything on the street. We heard sirens, cars honking, people yelling. 

I will never stay here again, no matter if I have a free room or not.

The casino and cheap drinks were cool though.We have stated at Golden Gate many times in the past and have always been pleased.  On this stay we learned they are now charging a $20 resort fee!  Yes a resort fee for no pool, no spa, no free self parking as a guest, and the list goes on..  We checked in and got stuck with a room that appeared more like a jail cell than a room and requested to be changed.  After changing rooms which was no problem we get to our "new room" and discover the AC wasn't blowing cold air, we contacted front desk for service which they supposedly had fulfilled and had AC fixed however still no cold air.  Day two housekeeping came in for room cleaning and left us with no toilet paper leaving us stranded until we made the trip to the front desk to get some.   Needless to say we won't be staying again and are very disappointed that Golden Gate had lost its touch :(DO NOT trust this place!  My dear friend of over 30 years and her fiance' have this to say about their experience with the Animal Foundation in Las Vegas, and I decided to try and help spread the word....

http://lasvegas.craigslist.org/laf/4456295710.html

...the sad story is all right there.  Again, DO NOT trust this place!!!This is def. NOT a dive bar!! This is an upscale/hipster hangout! Very clean and very modern on the inside, looks like it would be retro/vintage from the outside. I was hoping it would be retro on the inside having an old Vegas feel with old beer signs etc. Exact opposite. If you like paying $4 plus $1 for a tip for a beer this place will suit you. This bar is classified as a divebar.. NOT AT ALL A DIVE BAR!!!This place smells, is in a crappy location and was a total dive. Went to 20 pubs last trip to Vegas, this was the worst and the bartender Matt is a total douche.I went here once at 8 am just to pick up a friend. NEVER AGAIN!

So I park my car around the back and make my way to the lobby. I have yet to walk 5 feet when a homeless dude just comes out of nowhere and asks if I have any change I can spare. I tell him im married. Lol. He just looks at me like wtf? So I continue on. This time I am able to walk about 20 feet before I see another homeless dude pissing on the wall. That explains the piss smell that everybody on here is mentioning in their reviews.

So I finally make it to the waiting lobby. I find out that the bus my friend is on is gonna be late about an hour. Great. Can't really go back to my car and do much with an hour so I decided to stay in the lobby. Big Mistake.

I gotta give a shout out to the security guys and gals that have to force themselves to come work here because for the next 60 minutes, you got crackheads walkin around asking for money, prostitutes tryin to get some work in, their pimp walkin around makin sure they get their money, (I think it's the same guy strung out on crack. Great, a pimp that's a crack addict), and young punks that are probably lookin to sell their "stuff". The security guys are walking around the whole time making sure these "shady" people go on their merry way. Of course they have to leave them alone if they say they are waiting for their party to arrive. 

Finally, after about an hour and a half later, my friend shows up. Instead of giving him a hug and a how are you I said, "Next time, pay the extra cash to fly or rent a car cuz im not coming back here!" 

As soon as I got home, I quickly jumped in the shower for fear of contracting some unknown disease just by hanging out in the lobby for 90 minutes.

So yeah. IT IS AS BAD AS THEY SAY IN THESE REVIEWS!Wow!  I just want to rate this place the most depressing place on earth.  My friend's company does advertising for some hotel and so she wanted me to take a picture of some advertisement placed on the wall of this Greyhound bus station.  So we went and this place just had the atmosphere of severe sadness.  I don't know why, but I stepped inside and could not bring myself to smile.  Are all Greyhound bus stations this sad?I went into this Burger King, as I do every day for lunch, to get a quadruple Whopper meal with a King-sized fries and XXL diet Chocolate shake.  When I ordered, the person behind the counter took my hard-earned money and came back and gave me what looked like a BIG MAC!!!!!!

What the fuck???  If I wanted a nasty, processed, non flame-broiled Big Mac, I'd go to Wendy's.  I eat Burger King and ONLY Burger King.  So I politely asked the man behind the counter "What the fucking shit is this, you faggot???  I axed for a Whopper so get your head out of your Mom's cunt and GIVE ME A MOTHERFUCKING WHOPPER NOW!!!!!"

Just as I was about to throw a molotov cocktail at the fry cook rather than order something else on the menu that is exactly the same as the Whopper, I saw none other than "The King" himself come from behind the counter with my delicious fat-free Quadruple Whopper on a plate made of solid gold.  I realized that I was part of a hilarious hidden camera gag and loosened my chokehold on the girl with Down's syndrome who was refilling the ketchup and moved the shard of glass away from her jugular.  I chuckled and promptly apologized to the employees and customers who I had scared with my voice-raising and tard-choking and happily took my food to the parking lot to eat in my Honda Del Sol as I do every day.  I took my first bite of the Whopper and realized - THERE ARE ONLY THREE PATTIES ON THIS THING!!!

By then it was too late to raise another fuss and I had to get back to my job at Chick-Fil-A.  I am, however, currently trying to build a super laser so that I can vaporize that Burger King for fucking up my Whopper.  I will never forget.I'm really sorry to do this to all the peeps from hawaii that love downtown hotels but I have to write about the buffet at Fremont.
Just got back from Vegas and my wife and her cousin had a really bad experience.
The whole trip they were excited to get crab legs at Fremont on friday night. They couldn't wait so when friday came, you could see the excitement on their faces.
My wife used my coupon from vacations hawaii and her cousin just paid full price. $15.99. Super cheap..
They started to get down to business and piling on the crab legs and clams. Well half way through the dinner, the cousin bites into a clam and finds a STAPLE in the clam. Yes, a staple. They both were like "What the hell is this?'.
They call over to the manager that was standing there and told her about the situation. The manager had the nerve to ask the cousin if she put it there. They both were shocked at what she had said. They said 'no' but the manager didn't believe them. Come on lady, are you mental?
My wife and her cousin wanted just an apology and everything would of been okay but manager wench wasn't giving in. Okay, talk to the chef.
The chef comes out and was really sorry and kept on apologizing but I'm don't think he was using his noodle when he said" Oh yeah, this kind of thing happens all the time. At least once every other month" STUPID, you just admitted to having this problem and you're not trying to fix it. My wife and her cousin was laughing because they couldn't believe what these peolple were saying and doing. Nutcase manager and Stupid chef.
The manager is so pissed at my wife that she finally gives them a refund but not the $15.99 but the coupon. THANKS!!!!!!!!!! I guess she wants us to come back the next night. 
My wife left the place in shock and left a nice tip for the Fremont Buffet.
THE COUPON....So I will start off by saying about a month ago I was yelling to the TOP of my lungs everyone needs to visit the Fremont Casino its my favorite place!!!  They have the best tables!

Sadly I had a horrible experience and it has permanently changed my views of this place. I was playing at the Craps table ($3) and this very loud group next to me was playing and the man next to me on multiple occasion kept thinking my money was his. So in my mind I am like why aren't these people doing anything to prevent this? So it got so bad that they actually had to go look at the tape.

So here is my real issue. The man argued to the staff that it was his money on the table and I was nicely sad that it was mine but the game in no way could be stop while the conflict got resolved. So Money that no one could confirm sat on the table when all I wanted to was grab my money and leave. The Manager on duty Monica  was so rude to me she did look at the tape (for 10-15 mins) and saw that it was my money and when I asked for my $3 back YES $3 that they couldn't confirm that was mine she tried to tell me I was trying to get over and scamming them. I WAS LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS you guys make $3 in 0.02 seconds and you can't afford to give me $3???? She told me I had to make an appointment to speak to someone higher than her. the customer service was TERRRRIBLE and it did not stop there.

The next morning I called and asked to speak to the Operations Manager and he got on the phone and told me he would take a look at it and give me a call back and pretty much said what do you want and we cant give you anything more than $3. I NEVER HEARD FROM THIS MAN EVER AGAIN! 

and I made it clear if you would've given me the stinking $3 I would've given it right back to you at the craps table. 


Just be careful at this place... I am so sad that this happened to me at my FAVORITE place.
