Ate breakfast here today; overall a really good atmosphere and some tasty items on the menu.  I would recommend their Wiggies, a hodgepodge of hash browns, cheese, green peppers, diced ham, and mushrooms. I topped it off with a mimosa and
then my gf and I strolled out onto their dock and enjoyed some lakeside scene.Food: It's overall pretty good and probably one of the more reliable options for semi-authentic Chinese food in the Madison area.  To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates.  Definitely a step down if you're used to eating at, say, Chicago's Chinatown (both old and new sections), and there's no extra menu in Chinese with the more eclectic stuff.  Fresh seafood options very limited.

Service: Average.  Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty.

Value: Reasonable overall.  Prices fit the portions. Most entrees $9-15 range.

Overall: Good for when you crave Chinese, but I'd still head to Chicago for the more authentic stuff.Had a reservation at 7:15pm but when we arrived we were told we needed to wait 15 mins. That was annoying because that defeats the purpose of making a reservation. After that they found us a tiny table next to two large tables. The atmosphere was loud and cramped. 

The food however was great. I had the Bouillabaisse which felt like something from Louisiana because it had a thick earthy and spicy base. The seafood was fresh and it came with homemade fettuccine.  

If the atmosphere had been better I would make myself a regular.Good food but totally overpriced.Again... not a fan of Copps, in general. This one seems a bit older and a bit more in need of a facelift, but it's not bad. Wide aisles, plenty of check outs, and decent produce. 

Prices are typically higher than Woodman's, but Copps allows the use of credit cards (or using your debit card as a credit card, which I do because my bank gives me 5% cashback when I do).

Bakery items are usually stellar - especially the chocolate donuts. ;-)It's old.  It's small.  The staff was attentive.  Food showed up quick and tasted like IHOP food.I like it here, but I don't love it. Nothing really stands out to me, although my friend swears by the meatloaf (I refuse to order meatloaf in a restaurant). I will continue to got back, but I won't go out of my way.I am a huge fan of spicy food and this stuff knocked my socks off. If you aren't as adventurous with your spices (or just don't want your tongue to die) simply ask them to make it mild. 

All in all super yummy, will def be back. Oh and you have to try the thai iced tea. Its mental how good it is.

I gave it 3 stars because I don't want to throw around stars and save them for those rare AWESOME moments when food knocks my socks off :D

Enjoy!Driving down Central the other day I got the munchies mid morning.  I got a croissant sandwich.  The palce was clean, the service was pleasant, and my sandwich was cooked fresh.Steer clear if you care about your body, enter if you are looking for a tasty way to shave precious years of your life.  What they have done is basically take a simple New York style Deli concept and made it appealing to the local Phoenix crowd.  The thing is, when I was living in NYC, I could afford to eat meals like this because without a car I walked an average of 3-5 miles per day.  There is simply no excuse for this type of excess in a driving city like Phoenix.  You'll spend 2 hours at the gym to burn off lunch here.  My prediction is that 50 years from now, when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks, the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos: it seemed like a good idea at the time, but boy was it a killer.Zoe's Kitchen is good, but that's all I can say about it. I would happily go back for another meal, but it is never my first choice. The food is tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I don't want my review to sound negative - because I've never had a bad experience at Zoe's; it just isn't worth more than 3 stars.This is a nice spot to go if you're in downtown, but I can't call it a destination. It offers several restaurant options, which I haven't tried (but some are on my to-do list) and some shopping. The majority of the shops are tourist-oriented, which makes sense considering the Sheraton, Hyatt and Convention Center are within a couple blocks. The theater is clean, and it's nice that it's less crowded than those in the suburban strip malls. It has nice landscaping and it's great to have green space downtown, considering Phoenix could use some open public space (plazas, parks, etc.) in this area. However, the park is a bit secluded within the Arizona Center, which makes it a bit less inviting, but there are waterfalls and shade that keep the outdoor temperatures cooler in that area. That being said, there isn't too much for local appeal and overall it's good as a stop if you're spending a lot of time downtown. 

If you want to save on parking and don't mind the walking distance, there is a free lot on Central/McKinley northwest of the Arizona Center (and just northeast of the Westward Ho Building) ...that is, for now. It isn't a tremendous walking distance, however.Food is okay but nothing amazing. We had the huge hot dog
Atmosphere and service are okay. So nothing special but hey it's Alice Cooper, my wife didnt even know him !Came here just for a HH drink.  We had all had lunch & weren't hungry.  I'll come back when I am.  Cute names on the menu for their food items.  I was tempted by a lot it.  The local IPA was perfect.  Santan I believe was the name.  Feel sorry for all the staff who have to paint the black marks under their eyes.I was sort of expecting more from this. The food is decidedly average sports bar food, not really anything special. Plus, the side dishes are weird. Mandarin Oranges and apple slices don't really belong next to a burger, in my opinion. Still, it was a good enough meal, the waitress was super friendly and I highly recommend the Michael Buble drink, just drink with caution, it's strong!Whipped in here today for a first visit to this Whataburger & second visit to ANY Whataburger, ever.  (They're not in California, where I'm from.)

I ordered the Green Chili Double Cheeseburger Combo that is currently being advertised on TV, upgrading from a soda to a chocolate malt.  Here's how it went...

THE GOOD:

*  Nice dining room with comfortable booths.

*  Awesome service from the friendly and attentive staff!

*  They have MALTS!  Yeah malts!     :-))

*  The fries were ok.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:

*  It was COLD in the dining room!

*  The heralded Green Chili Double Cheeseburger was a disappointment.  The diced chilis were so mild as to be nearly tasteless, and the burger patties were blah too.  This burger was nowhere as good as a similarly priced one at either Smashburger or Five Guys, for example,or a Double Double at In-N-Out for much less.     :-O

*  The malt was ok, but not as good as the ones at Smashburger.

All in all?  3 Stars, barely.     :-|

Green Chili Double, Medium Fries, Small Chocolate Malt:  $8.14 + tax.Is it normal for "Thai-style chicken" to look like pineapple? 

Just got back from lunch with my co-worker.  It was nearby, had decent reviews and I wanted Chinese. My co-worker, whose Chinese, jumped at the opportunity to go to a new place for lunch nearby since she usually only goes to places her friends recommend.  Overall - it was ok-good. Staff was friendly - suggested what I try. Co-Worker (CW) was excited about the Thai menu. She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX). 

HOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. 

Moving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking. Is it normal for the chicken to look like pineapple? That threw me off - it was cubed and had a yellow-ish tint. It was very soft too - gave me a weird I like/don't like feeling. But i continued to eat and overall, I liked it. 

My CW got the #7 Thai special that came in a bowl. Had lots of veggies, chicken in some creamy spicy sauce. She had me try the sauce and it was pretty good (I wish I had taken more to put on my meal from her bowl when she offered). I'm not so sure she enjoyed the place as much and I'm not surprised. At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a "really good" Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends. 

I wouldn't mind going back to try the Chinese menu - they have a huge selection and it's nearby, a great price for lunch, not busy and pretty friendly.items are nicely arranged but prices are too high!After hearing numerous things about MacAlpine's from friends and other Yelpers, my boyfriend and I decided to pop in.

We both ordered the Toasted Cheese Sandwich (grilled cheese w/ 3 types of cheese) and I was really disappointed with it. Mostly because I was expecting fries as a side and they don't serve them but also because the cheese was not the least bit melted. When I bit into my sandwich I expected strands of hot, gooey cheese to stretch in front of my face but instead I opened up my sandwich to find 3 slices of cheese barely stuck together and still in perfect squares. Buuuut I'm not really one to complain. I ate what I could and asked myself what I really expected. After all, it's only a grilled cheese. And that's not what MacAlpine's is known for...

They're known for their sodas. Which are everything they're made out to be. After much deliberation,  I ordered the Nutty Professor Ice Cream soda (Pistachio ice cream w/ Amaretto soda) and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back to try the Red Velvet Soda. And maybe the Parisian ice cream soda. Or maybe just the entire dessert menu.

Perhaps my favorite part of our visit was the thrift/antique store. They have an amazing selection of treasures. I spent $50 on old photos for my assemblage art and wished I had won the lottery so I could afford all the vintage cameras, shoes, toys, and lamps. Definitely a little pricey in some areas but justly so. The owner doesn't mess around when selecting pieces for the shop.My aunt and uncle were in town for my graduation and got into town looking for something to do so we went to Spiked at DBG. (http://www.dbg.org/index.php/plan/calendar/spikedspring)  

The event was a cool setup you pay to get in $25 a person.  Then you get all you can eat food and you can tour the gardens at night.  They have alcohol at the event and it is pay per drink.  The prices weren't too bad pretty typical drink prices for being out.  

The gardens at night offer a different experience then the daytime there are several cactus flowers that bloom at night.  Plus as the temperature rises it's nice to have events in the evening.Overall, the museum itself is great and my 3 year old loves it but the woman working there is always RUDE and the toys in the kids area are FILTHY. The place is usually pretty empty other than a few toddler/preschool age kids and maybe one or two adults roaming around. I definitely think the kids are keeping this place open so maybe they should take that into consideration at the front desk and when it comes to cleanliness. (Seriously, it's disgusting. I'm worried we're going to come home with hepatitis one of these days.)The inside is very Hispanic, the food not so much. Not to say that is not good. But not authentic. It has a good flavor, but is pretty generic Mexican food. Now the Margaritas are wonderful!!!! I usually don't drink more then one but at this place you just can't help yourself. I like fruity girlie drinks, where you don't taste the liquor you just feel the affect. This is exactly what I want. Uno Mas, the water is no longer needed!Considering it's not much more than a lunch room for the surrounding offices, it's really not bad. Most of the sandwiches I've had there have been ok experiences. The service is quick.  

I've noticed that they sometimes will spoil an otherwise really good dining experience by doing something like leaving pits in certain olives that appeared to be without pits. Or some of the cole slaw will be wilted. Or the shell in the clam chowder mentioned earlier. I don't consider these events fatal flaws, but y'know . . . come on. . . . a little more effort.

I don't like how the line is laid-out. The path from ordering and paying to picking up your food and drink is convoluted and annoying. They could improve their flow and ergonomics and make take away some of the anxiety I feel before going there--and thus I might go there more frequently.do not get their coffee. ive never tasted anything worse. otherwise, their tacos are great.24 hour fedex and copy location. Visited for a package delivery and cost $13 to ship a book and cd. If these items weren't personalized with a message to the recipient, I would have just shipped new items from amazon and it would have been the same or cheaper. Yes, that was the cheapest 7 day shipping possible :(

I can say that the items did arrive without any significant incidents or events.

They are also a Kinkos copy center to make copies of stuff and purchase office supplies. If you need this stuff late night, they're open and waiting for you.The Good Egg has reasonable food. It isn't amazing, but it's not bad. Prices are pretty reasonable, too.

This location has lots of parking since it's in a shopping strip. Inside, the decor is a little dated, but I think that's a common theme for breakfast restaurants. The manager is very friendly and attentive; I think some of the servers should take a cue from him and try to do the same.

French toast are big, loaded with cinnamon, and tasty. Bacon is nothing extraordinary. Veggie omelet is a reasonably good, healthy option. I like the breakfast potatoes, even if they are a bit plain.

This isn't my first choice for brunch, but it's a pretty good, simple backup.Katz Deli is indeed closed -- but the space will become a second Postino location.Its a cute atmosphere, food was alright, nothing spectacular.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't speak for the brews.

Parking leaves a bit to be desired, but for as full as the lot was, there were plenty of tables inside.

A nice brewhouse in central Phoenix if you aren't in the mood for driving out to one of the Four Peaks.Average beer... Great food.Eatable but nothing special . Pizza was ok .Earlier this month I was in Phoenix visiting my brother-in-law.  In trying to find a decent place for breakfast, he recommended 5 and Diner, saying it is as close to an old school diner out west.  While the food there, wasn't bad, it wasn't great either.  Adding to the mediocre food was the incredibly slow service.  All in all, it is an okay place for breakfast, but that is about it.The pros: 
- fresh ingredients
- attention to detail 
- variety of foods, snacks, goodies and drinks

The cons:
- expensive
- location / parking inconvenient

Brief review:
All in all, a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside. Friendly, prompt service. Clean tables. Great atmosphere!  The only real problem is your wallet is going to be much, much lighter after you leave.  If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place.Big Lots is a Big Lots is a Big Lots.  Not sure why everyone was so disgusted by it, it wasn't terrible at all.  Same ol' same ol'I have a love/hate relationship with the Merc Bar.  I love the ambiance, I love the scotch menu, if I were single-I would love the ladies.. or I would love it as a date bar.  On the inverse side, Merc is a tad snooty.  Once, I was denied enterance purely because I was wearing a hat.  Now, this wasn't some meat-head sporty cap, nor was it a gangsta rag; no, it was simply one of those little military style caps with the short bill that you see all the hipsters wearing these days.  Comeon folks, you're in a freakin mall, LET ME WEAR MY CAP, I'M BALDING FOR GODS SAKE!!  ONLY 3 STARS FOR YOU!!!I have been to Miracle Mile before, just not this one. 
Probably not a fair review because I only got a grill cheese sandwich. It comes with a side, I got chips and a drink. You get to choose your bread and I chose the marble rye. The makings for a great sandwich. So what kind of cheese do they use? Not real cheese. You know the kind that is wrapped in plastic and will keep in the refrigerator for two years and still be eatable. 
On the better side my mother in law and father in law got a ruben and a turkey. Those sandwiches really looked good and they said so. 
The service was as good as you could ever expect at a cafeteria type of eatery. Everyone was friendly and the people that came by the tables cleaning and helping guests were fantastic. I was very impressed with they way they took care of everyone. 
Unless you are fond of imitation cheese pass on the grill cheese sandwich. Everything else looked good.They didn't really have anything vintage or retro. The store was clean and well organized but lacking some fun pieces.My husband and I used to frequent the Keegan's in Ahwatukee, but we have moved from that area and are slightly closer to this Camelback location. 
We ate breakfast at this location for the first time yesterday.

I found the service to be a bit slow, but our server was very polite and accomodating.

I ordered the cinnamon brioche french toast. I would go as far to say this is the best french toast I have ever eaten. It was so moist and tasty! 

I like the set up of the Ahwatukee location better. The bathrooms at this location are not as nicely kept as the 'tukee location.

I'll definitley be back for Sunday brunch again for some of that great french toast and hope to check it out for dinner some night. Keegan's usually has some good, home cooking dinner specials, so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night.Pimp my Hotel will not be featured here.

This place is old.  It's tired.  It's in a neighborhood that's loaded with strip joints.  What's good about it, you ask?  It's close to alot and I talked the manager into giving me free Internet for the week because I didn't want to pay for it.   Hey, I brought a small team here to stay, so they got some good business out of me!

The good things are:  

1.  They really do a nice job with the free breakfasts.  Bless the woman's heart she is patient enough to listen to my attempts to eat healthy, "I'd like an egg white omelet, very little oil, spinach, mushrooms and some ham".  She turns to me, "Would you like to sneak a little cheese in that?"  I say, "Maybe just a sprinkle".  Damn she made a good one for me.
2.  Free managers happy hour (but only 2 choices of beer -- this is bad).
3.  Close to the stadium where the Diamondbacks play.
4.  Short drive away from the mall.
5.  There is a LA Fitness and a 24 Hour Fitness nearby.

Cons:

1.  No gym (just 2 treadmills).
2.  Rooms are old.  
3.  Shitty neighborhood (think ankle holsters and shoulder rigs).
4.  Not much within walking distance (although Carl's Jr. is right across the street!)

All in all, it's convenient to the airport, freeways, and there are free breakfasts here.  If you're not in the mood for omelets, there are other options such as cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, oatmeal, pastries, and pancakes.  You can't go wrong with that, sometimes.Its a pretty nondescript dive.  Its basically a hallway, which makes its kind of neat... and there is a big fish tank with weirdly cool fish to stare at.  Otherwise its your typical dive bar atmosphere.  They do have 'fish tank specials' which means that about 10 bottles are lined up in front of the fishies and they are marked pretty cheaply (naturally the price is written in Sharpie on the bottle).  

I wanted to try the 'chocolate vodka' so I basically got a really full glass of straight vodka for $2.50.  Odd drink but lots of alcohol quite inexpensively.  The bartender had to have been high on something.  No complaints though... she was hilarious just to watch.  

I would definitely go back on any dive bar crawl.  - also try Darwins just two doors down!Very friendly ladies. Only used them for dry cleaning. They did a good job, but seem a little pricey. $19.50 for 4 of my husbands shirts.I had surgery here a few years ago and it went well.  I had to stay overnight so I got to taste their food... It was not that bad for hospital food.  The nurses are friendly and took good care of me.  Admitting and check in went very smoothly without any hang ups.We used to go here years ago. Been going to ajo als and Arriba's since. They are just closer to where we live.
I ordered the pollo fundido, which is what I order at the other places. It was drier and not as tasty as I've gotten used to. Still a good dish but it'll probably be years before I go back again.
The service was awesome. The guy who brings the chips and salsa and refills the drinks- totally awesome. My drink was never below 1/2- I love that. We tipped him separate...Wings....eat the wings!! Be sure to ask for them grilled! It takes a little while longer to get them, but totally worth the wait. Aside from the wings, the Nachos are pretty tasty.

Other than that, it's a pretty standard sports bar. However, there are masses upon masses of TVs here, which makes it nice if you are wanting to watch a game. The downside: if the place gets busy, the servers are usually not equipped to handle it. Aside from the TVs, there is trivia, karaoke, and a pool table. Another major plus for us smokers: the outside patio, which includes MORE TVs. Weeeee! Sorry for the excitement, but TVs on the patio are hard to come by.

The food overall is average. A few things that are good. The burgers are solid, and you have the option of really customizing them (different meats, cheeses, buns, etc). The wraps are horrible! Old lettuce, dry and hard wrap. Icky.  Drinks are priced well.

I need a half star. YELP!!!! Yelp me! Listen to me! We need half stars!!!! This is a 3.5 star place.

Food: C
Prices: B
Ambiance: B+
Service: C
Overall: C+Some coworkers and I ended up here after the team trivia location we were going to go to ended up getting rescheduled (woops!). I have heard of Brigett's but this was my first time there. It is divey but I felt comfortable parking out front and heading in by myself. I found my group and had a seat, and the server was very nice and attentive throughout the night. It is a ways away from home so I can't say I'll be running back, but the crowd inside (on a Thurs night) was chill and I had a good time.good menudo on weekends, decent burritos, but they get a crazy 2 point deduction for having watered down hunt's tomato sauce in lieu of salsa. i've actually seen this at several other phoenix area restaurants, so it might be contagious. their location on mohave is pretty gangxta, so make sure to tell all your out of town friends about that hole in the wall in that colorful neighborhood you love so much.I just returned from Phoenix on a business trip.  Sky Harbor is a very busy airport.  Everything makes sense when you follow the signs posted.  The layout of the airport is pretty simple as well.  It has three levels in terminal 4 where I was.  One bizarre thing I did notice was that you take an escalator down from level 3 to level 1, but must take an elevator to get back up.  And the elevators are not right next to escalator.  They're close.  You just have to search.  The information booths were very helpful in helping me locate them.

The only bad experience I had was at baggage claim.  Some of the baggage staff were barking curses and behaving like gangsters.  It definitely reflected poorly on the airport.  At one point, I thought they were going to fight each other over a lunch break.  I also heard some older baggage claim staff complaining openly about how the passengers do not care at all about the way they operate.  They seemed very disgruntled.

Security was pretty tight.  In Orlando, I had to remove my shoes to go through security.  At Sky Harbor, everyone kept their shoes on.  I was randomly asked by a security guard to hold out my hands so they could pass a wand over them to look for signs of chemicals.  I've never experienced that before at any other airport.  It wasn't a bad experience.  I thought all airports had the same procedures for checking passengers, but I guess not.

Overall, it was a good experience.  It was A-OK.  I know they can make it better.  There was a lot of construction going on outside the airport.  Maybe those improvements will help with traffic and parking?  Next they might want to look at hiring some new staff or taking better care of the current staff at baggage claim.I was there for an hour, in between flights.  It has bathrooms, planes, overpriced food and gift stores, and is moderately clean and well tended.Clean comfortable, only downfall was the noise from the airplanes flying over and rattling the room. Love that they allowed my dog :-)Waffle House, I can't give you five stars for awesomeness, but you deserve at least a couple stars for being open 24 hours and feeding a hungry girl with a late night craving of waffles and eggs.  This place is the typical diner fare, but for a fraction of the price.  Don't expect haute cuisine.... but you'll be happy with the cheap eats and friendly service.Just happened here, on a business trip, between arriving at the airport and our afternoon meeting.  It was like we were in Sonoma, not Phoenix.

The pulled pork tacos were really nice and fresh, the tortilla soup a bit oily.  Someone else got some bread pudding and it was gooood.

Somehow, they ran out of running water, even in the bathrooms.  Strange, is that just part of this being a farm?Came back for lunch and sushi was very fishy. Prices are still good and happy to get free soup. They should also tweak their salad dressing because it's very pungent and not in a good way.My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again.Nice atmosphere and everything.  I think I have been there at least 6 or 7 times and the last 3 or 4, they were out of the wheat crust.  It's one of my favorite things and they are ALWAYS out of it.  You would think that if you are always running out, you would make more, right?  But in the end, the food is good.  Service is good enough.  Probably should be a 4 star rating, but the "out of wheat crust" thing really frustrates me and I will likely not go back.Booked an upgraded suite for spring break (believe me, location upgrade only) through AE and called before we departed to verify, only to find it was not granted. That's why you pay AE, so I called them and they demanded the upgrade (no biggie, but not a good start).  I checked in with 3 kids (obviously we need our requested 2 doubles), but I had a feeling things weren't going to be smooth.  Checked in and directed to the car by the uninterested and bothered front desk person where a bell hop said he will show me the way.  Pulled the car around and "he gone", but they were busy so I figured I would find it myself.   As I finally find a spot, I flag down another bell hop, we get to the room and open the door to our 5 day stay.  Ugh, dirty room with one bed.  My 10 year old walks in and literally pulls me to the side, and whispered, "no offense Dad, but this place is a dump".  And this is the supposed upgrade which overlooked the water park?  
No worries son, we cant stay here anyway.  Bellhop called the front and we were switched to another room w 2 beds, as we trekked to the next room my 8 year old tells me he saw the toilet was used and not flushed... verified by his brother. I'm not squeamish but at this point I have a case of heebie jeebies and want to leave.  Could this hotel be fairytale horrible? 
Actually I thought to myself we're just camping in style, lets deal.  
The next room was better, certainly not spotless by any means, but here for the kids and the weather/water park. Wow, management needs to crack the whip a little.  How about upgrading the mildew carpets or paint the walls once on awhile?
Ok bad start but the place ends up growing on us and we enjoy the small pools next to the rooms, room service, buffet breakfast, water park activities, and even the Rooste restaurant.  The gym is great with plenty of options.  Loved the hiking in back and most employees we meet are very friendly.  Took day trips to Sedona, and Scottsdale to break up the stay and had a great finish to our break.  
The water park gets annoying crowded and people save chairs like its Black Friday...lined up before the park opens to get the prime spots (I'm past the point of little non swimmers but note if you want to watch a toddler).  
Overall a solid C, but could be a B with some work on the rooms.  I thought the food was good to great.  Prices fairly high but not unexpected. 
I cant forget that on Easter I asked the concierge for Catholic mass times nearby. Picked the noon mass but it was started at 1230 and said in Latin.  Really?
Absolutely kids only hotel. A stay here without kids would be a hazard to your mental health.Well, as usual, I am writing this review to share my opinions and observations with other Yelpers. My family and I went to eat dinner here over the weekend along with an important out-of-town visitor that we were entertaining. We decided to try this restaurant since we are always looking for a good Northern Italian restaurant and have not really found one here in the valley, despite living here for over 25 years. So we gave it a shot. I have some good comments and some not-so-good comments to share: 

First the good. Although the menu is limited (by my standards, albeit they have a decent selection), the food was good. We ordered a wide variety of dishes from various appetizers, salads, an antipasti plate, pastas, veal dishes, lobster ravioli, and other entrees. Everyone said that the entrees and appetizers were very good, including me, who ordered the simplest dish because I love it -- Italian sausage and peppers over fettuccine. And the portions are large and the prices are very good. The service is decent and passable. 

Now for the not-so-good. First of all, there were only two parties eating dinner that night. A party of 8 and our party of six......that's all. I think the bad economy is hurting this restaurant as well as other better dining establishments. But the problem was even when I asked for a different seating area and finding more room for our table(s), we were told that we couldn't do that. WTF! With only two parties in a big restaurant? And they put our parties right next to each other! How freaking noisy and irritating was that? There was only one server too, and I think he might have been either the manager or the owner. I can understand the need to reduce staff if business is poor, but that was a little too much for me. Next, the wine list is poor -- with many of the wines "out of stock" and most of the labels are from unknown vineyards. The prices for the wines were really not bad for a retail restaurant -- I paid $85 and $89 for two bottles of maybe $35 wines, but is to be expected. I would have been willing to pay even more if the wines were better and from recognizable vineyards -- either from Napa or Italy. And although the food was good along with the prices, the salad was bad. It was like out of a supermarket bag -- "field greens". And the dressing was blase and boring. And lastly, my party had four dessert eaters, but the dessert options were boring and poor. Again, probably due to the poor business volume, they have to cut back on the dessert options and the more costly and sophisticated desserts. 

My suspicion is that this restaurant probably had better options and choices for everything in better times, but today, I would say it is so-so at best. My wife said she would not go back again. For me personally, I would go back just for a simple meal for myself and my wife and daughter, since the food is good and the prices right. 

So I am still searching for a good Northern Italian restaurant. Oh yeah, one more thing -- I will have to give them credit for being willing to make simple menu changes that we requested. I can understand that restaurants won't make things on the menu if the requests are too far afield from their standard items, but things like making the dish without alcohol in it should be accommodated. And for the seafood pasta dishes, my wife only wanted clams and not the mussels, shrimps, and fish, and they did that. My daughter wanted a cheese pasta dish but also wanted some "meat" so they added a grill chicken breast on top. Oh yeah, my wife wanted the lobster ravioli as an appetizer so they made a special appetizer size for her. When she shared some with the others, a couple of others changed their entrees to the lobster ravioli since it was very good.They ROYALLY messed up our order here. We actually were seated in the bar and expected to have to wait a bit for food, but I think the waiter forgot to put our order in. Everyone around us was served before we were. When we finally asked you could see the lightbulb go off and up comes the manager. "There was a mix up in the kitchen and your food will be right up, please order a desert on us". The reason I am giving this review 3 stars is simply because the food (eventhough it was probably prepared in a hurry with a cursing manager wagging her finger at the chef) was absolutely perfect. The butterfish is so great and the pineapple upside down cake was a pleasant but not over sweet dessert.It is my favorite vietnamese restaurant.
It's small but clean. Their soups are great. They serve fresh and tasty foods.
Portion is not big enough for me though.
I wish they serve bigger size meals.Let me start out by saying that I'm not a Trader Joe's fan, but after a recent debate about grocery stores where a friend really stood her ground about it having such great prices, I figured I would suck it up and give this location a try. It's located in a strip mall (surprise!!) with the worst parking lot ever, so I didn't really know what to expect. My only other TJ experiences have been in Center City Philadelphia (gross) and a stand-alone in a suburban Seattle neighborhood.

This store is really clean. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly crowded, but the shelves were stocked and it was pretty easy to maneuver around. If I had a cart it might be another story but I grabbed a basket and went up and down each aisle a couple times. The only messy area was the bathroom but I probably just caught it in between cleaning shifts. 

Not knowing what I was looking for, I picked up a couple items for dinner and snacks for the kids. Yogurt tubes - good price. English muffins - good price and probably the best I have ever had. Orange Chicken (frozen) - could have been spicier but the kids loved it. Meat dept - expensive...better prices at Sprouts. Frozen blueberries - cheapest around. All-in-all it was a good experience, I was pleasantly surprised, and I started drafting my "okay, you win" text to my friend who stood her ground and I headed to the register.

I stood in line and when I was my turn, I told my cashier that I had a bag. This is where they get docked 2 stars. For the amount of time it takes to ring up the 7 items that I had, my cashier made not one, not two, but five smart-ass comments about the fact that I had a Whole Foods bag. I know, I know, what a dumb thing to get bent over, but for me it has to do with service, and Roger (cashier), should just bite his tongue, keep his opinions to himself, and just be happy that I am contributing to his ability to receive a paycheck. I know the $22 I spent is just a teeny-tiny percentage of what the store brings in on a normal day, but because of that interaction, I won't go out of my way to shop there, even if it means saving a couple bucks.The food here is pretty standard just like Chili's and TGIF. I eat here more than other burger restaurants mainly because of their royalty rewards card. I've already received about 4 free entrees as well as free appetizers and a free birthday burger. Other than that its just another mediocre American food family restaurant.BBQ is one of my favorite past times. The food here is pretty good but nothing to write home about. Maybe the menu is just too big or they have spread themselves a little too thin.

Inside is decorated with all sorts of items from the Chicago area. The walls are covered with plenty to look at and they even have an old timey phone booth in the back section. Ring ring!

Been here a few times and usually get some of the Brisket and possible a Hot Link. The meat is always tender and not dry like other places. The BBQ sauce is just a little too sweet for this bad boy. Would like to see a sauce with less stickiness per square inch. Maybe there is just too much molasses or corn syrup in there.

They also offer a large variety of many of the Chicago favorites. Chicago Dogs, Italian Beefs, so forth and so on. Maybe I'll take the Dog for a walk around the block next time.

Service is always friendly. Maybe too friendly. I'm usually in a hurry and sometimes do not feel like chatting about life's particulars. You do have to give them credit for trying. Some places just give you the stink eye and expect you to be happy.

Going with an average score of A-OK on this puppy. Give them a try and see what you think. I'll probably be back again for one of their lunch specials. Maybe I'll bring my own sauce. WUZ UP!

3.25 STARSAll About Fun And Footcare!

Upon deciding to do something different a month ago, I proudly went there alone on a whim after a mani/pedi on a Friday. I neither knew what to expect nor know what the West Coast Swing was, and didn't care. 

After a briefing on what the dance pattens would look like, I took to it like a cat to a scratching post and was swinging in no time. I forgot the guy's name who walked me through it, but he was very personable and patient.  I like the way he held my hand. Simple, non-pretentious, made me very comfortable --he was a gentleman. : ).  I had a really good time dancing and conversing with others there. I left heavily perspired, but also refreshed, too...and slept like brick!

I woke up the next morning doing the 'east valley shuffle' out of bed, immediately went to urgent care and was diagnosed with plantar fascitis :( .  I didn't realize why that heel was a 'thorn in my side' for a month prior to the event; thought it would just go away on its own (bummer).

Pros: convenient location, ample parking (get there early), pleasant staff, friendly atmosphere and people, you can dance there pretty much all night long.

Con: try not to do any dances if you have either sciatica or that plantar thingy I got, take care of the weird aches and pains with a doc or chiro first before 'cuttin' the rug' or you'll only exacerbate it and be shufflin' along like me.

As soon as my issue passes you may see me there, but it'll be awhile.Your standard Goodwill, holding a selection of older appliances, electronics, housewares, as well as furniture. Need a turntable with missing needle? Ever wanted to try out one of those fad exercise machines that rock in unnatural ways? Or do you need a random bed sheet that is a print of all the islands of Hawaii? Well, look no further! There are also lots of racks of clothes here to browse through, ranging from casual to prom-dressy. I can never quite pinpoint what that "Goodwill" odor is when you are browsing through their stores. Is it the particular type of disinfectant they use?Love the sopapillas here! Nice local place!Went back and the food is good and the pricing is decent.  Oscar is a great cook and made up for the groupon incidentFriendly neighborhood sushi bar...think Cheers with raw fish and nicer decor.

Solid quality of fish with a nice selection of all the usual suspects.  Also good selection of cooked dishes for the non-raw eaters.I like this location because they have a drive-thru. Even though there is almost always a long line, they get you on your way fast. The staff is friendly and competent. Also, they rarely run out of anything (other locations seem to go through their entire inventory of breakfast sandwiches and scones by 9am).

If you are the type that does not drink your morning coffee inside a moving vehicle, they also have comfy chairs inside and decent patio seating.  The patio faces the parking lot and drive-thru but it does have shade umbrellas so it can be very pleasant in the morning.Chompies is great, i love the corned beef & pastrami sandwich..the food is very tastey..also if you want some amazing pancakes try the Wheat STUFFED GRANOLA ones they are out of this world.. on Shea The Chompies on Shea has one problem, its the service, now the servers are nice & all but they seem to maybe be understaffed, takes forever to get your order. Another thing that caused me to give it 3 stars is the price, chompies is pretty darn expensive, expect to pay about $15-$20 for a basic breakfast, i only order 2 eggs, potatos & dry toast & sometimes pancakes..when i go there for lunch & get the corned beef sandwish, fries, & a drink its about $25..but the portions are LARGE & u will definitley not leave there hungry!Massage was great, but only 3 stars because the common area is not seperate from the men.  We share a sauna, steam room, hot tub, etc.  I wasn't thrilled about having to wear my swimsuit and having men stare at me.I'm painting my living room and have no time to cook, I can't say this is reviewable its dominos... The delivery guys are really friendly and courteous.We stayed here over the weekend because we attended a wedding close by and didn't want to drive home. 

The room was really nice. Clean. Everything you expect of a Hilton property. The property is very nice, but a bit confusing, I got lost finding my room, with a map in hand! 

The bride and groom had the after party in the hotels lounge, the staff on hand looked very displeased to be there and were mumbling about the wedding party arriving. The bride and groom gave the hotel fair notice that this would happen so they could staff accordingly. I guess the lounge doesn't see much action and the staff didn't want to really work. Whatev. 

We went to eat breakfast at the restaurant the next morning and it was INSANELY over priced! $14 for a freaken waffle? You are nuts! 

All in all, its a nice place. Close to everything if you want to do the touristy Scottsdale stuff.This is a great place to eat "except" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat.So let's start with the the good stuff.  We went in for lunch on a Tuesday, we got greeted and sat down right away.  We decided what we wanted and ordered.  When the food got there it was pretty good.  I would go back for the food.  Now to what was not good.  Our service was not good. The guy who brought out our food was rather rude.  Our rice order was wrong, it wasn't a huge deal.  We ordered brown rice and got white rice.  I let the waitress know and she asked the guy who brought our food to get the brown rice.  Once again, he was really not friendly.  He gave us the impression he was pissed to have to be helping us at all. Our waitress was ok.  Just ok.  So since this was our first visit I will go back because I liked the food.  If the service isn't better there will not be a third time.I am from San Francisco on business in North Scottsdale, and I saw this restaurant on Groupon. I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious "regulars", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star.Stopped by today to get a few things and when I was walking through the garden section I saw a baby bunny!! The girl working there said they have a bunch of them living there and that the bunny's are happy as can be... 

Crazy, but pretty cool...The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the "Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining" - older and almost antiquated.While Arriba Mexican Grill may be exclusive to Arizona, it's desire to be a major chain may be what keeps it average.  In an area that has an abundance of Mexican establishments (both on the low and high end), very little about Arriba stands out in the crowd.

The several odd things about the restaurant stick out like sore thumb.  What's with the New Mexico theme?  Having only driven through the state, I'm not sure if New Mexican has its own culinary style.  I always just assumed that like many other southwest states, New Mexico just fit into Tex-Mex.  The menu being exclusively pictures is a turn off.  Makes me feel like I'm at an Ihop or Denny's.  And having the descriptions in a small white text over a black background in a dim room made it very hard to read.  They also seated patrons near the bar, and left the main dining section fairly empty.  I don't know if they were short staffed, but I notice as I was leaving that there was a wait, even though I was able to see that the dining room had several empty tables.

The service was excellent.  The waiter was friendly and our drinks were constantly refilled.  The ambiance isn't bad.  We were seated next to an open sliding door which showed off an outdoor water fall/pond setup.  Chips and salsa were at the the table immediately.  The spicy was wonderful.  The mild was okay.  The bean dip was awful.  The food was also pretty good.  While it tries to be different, it doesn't seem to stand out.Food is very average.  Excellent beer but you can get it all over town these days!  Hit up the Tempe location for the authentic experience and nice scenery.  Don't be afraid to try something new from their selection of homemade beers - almost always way above average!Saw the Angels/Rangers game here on Tuesday.  A nice stadium, $5 to park, and reasonable lawn tickets at $6.  Don't waste your money on an expensive seat...chances are you can just go sit down low anyway.I'm on what feels like a never ending search for a groomer that can cut my dog's hair and feel like I've gotten close with Shelly's Pet Grooming. I took Baxter in with a jacked up (and grown out) hair cut he got from Bark N' Babies and asked that they just do whatever they could with him. I pretty much left it in the very nice groomer's hands and said go as short as you have to. The shop is clean and everyone else seemed to be pretty friendly, so I left him with fingers crossed! The groomer did a really good job and definitely went short, but I was completely okay with it! Sometimes you just have to start over. The pricing was decent and I walked away feeling pretty good about the experience - not to mention that my little guy smelled amazing! Since he has longer hair, I'd be interested to see what they're able to do when I don't want him to get a military cut! I definitely think Shelly's is worth another try!The regular food is, well... okay. But frankly, for the same money you can go to the store and get the salad fixings you like, and it will last you a week.

HOWEVER, you have to go in on Sunday mornings. Great breakfest buffet. I especially like this because I don't like cooking breakfast. I'm tired and I'm hungry - who wants to mix waffle batter half asleep?

But I am saying it's bad for kids so you leave them at home. I hate children, and I hate yours more. Buy them a cage before you go out to places I suggest!I have gotten take out from here twice now and think they are pretty good.  The service has been quick and the staff very nice. I am a soft bread kind of guy and think the super soft wheat bread is pretty terrific.  They have the all the standard sub toppings, nothing special. I have purchased hot and cold subs and have to give a higher rating to the cold ones since my steak and cheese was luke warm.

As other have mentioned the "Whole" sub is really, really large.There's a little something for everyone at this South Tempe dance club. Even my Mom likes to come here! Graham, as the regulars call it, features four rooms -- the South Beach room where a DJ spins hip-hop and techno music along with the country-heavy Rockin' Rodeo room, the retro Confetti's where a DJ spins '80s and '90s hits and Alley Cats, a karaoke bar. It tends to draw an older crowd and you'll see a lot of cowboys. But the beer is certainly cheap! There are drink specials galore every night.I love a good bagel and cream cheese, especially on a Saturday Morning.  Mind you, I have been here several times before, so its not my first time.

The benefits of Einsteins is that they make all their tasty bagels in site. Flavors are tasty, with Asiago cheese, onion, garlic, and a few other flavors as well.  Great selection of different flavors of bagels.  They also have a few different options in cream cheese flavors as well.

They also have a great selection of lunch sandwiches, which I like.  Great selection pastries, juices, etc.

Where they loose points with me, is I don't care for the service here.  I always always always have to stand in line and wait; not only to place my order, but to pay and recieve my food as well.  Some could argue that maybe I am being fussy.  Others could say that I need to be more patient at times.  I do not argue that point. BUT, nothing irks me more then waiting...and waiting....and more waiting.

I have never NOT had to step in line here, regardless of time of day.  Why is that? I don't understand.

Also, I feel that service here lacks.  I always see multiple staff members behind the counter.  If thats the case, why is it always the same 1 person taking orders, and one working the register?  I also sense that maybe other customers get frustrated with this experience as well.  I go here becuase they do have great bagels, and their stuff is tasty...but at the cost of waiting....and iffy service.

Plus, sometimes this place is NOT super clean.  Its not filthy or anything..but I just feel like maybe it could use a good cleaning at times.They took the Chicken con Broccoli off of the menu!  So bummed!  Luckily the all-you-can-eat soup, salad and breadsticks are still an option at lunch time.Our Indian cowkrs like eating here so that should be a good recommendation, which is why you see some long tables setup to handle group lunches (ie. going away party and there's Indian peers joining).  Don't worry, it's both meat and veg offerings.

Being no authority on Indian food, so I won't comment except to say my stomach seems to be thinking about the lunchtime buffet.  There's a slow burn in my stomach still a good hour afterwards from the spiciness of the dishes.Let me preface this by saying that I could eat Thai food every day until I die without a single complaint. Favorite. 

This place was...fine. I went at lunch and ordered the pad thai to go and the yellow curry chicken. The meals come with an egg roll, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. It was so heavily fried that it literally dripped oil. Not my style. I tasted the pad thai, and it, too, was very oily. The flavor was fine, but a little bland, and there was not much in the way of chicken or shrimp. The portion was, as others have mentioned, noticeably smaller than most thai places...but a reasonable serving size none the less. 

So, the curry. 
I just...I can't even...ugh. It was so good. Thick and creamy curry, al dente carrots and peppers, and perfectly tender potatoes along with sliced white meat chicken. Guys, It was so good. I hate that the portion was so small--I typically expect to have leftovers for at least another meal. It was only $6 though so I certainly can't knock it. 

The overall experience was fine, the place was clean and the food took a long time to come out but that's worth it for the fresh food. I'm torn, because the curry is worth going back for but I'm not so confident on the rest of the menu.This place is ok, we seem to stop by here every once and a while because their happy hour is decent, and the food is good, they only have their beer so its good to go for something different, their mug club is pretty cool, you get rewards depending on visits or pints bought, plus they put a $10 credit on it for my birthday. Haven't had the best service but it's a pretty chill place.I'm not a big mall fan, but this one is pretty nice.  Good selection of stores on two levels.  Food court with your usual faire.  Overall appears clean and safe.  Parking is a challenge, especially the limited handicapped parking.  Worth a trip to do some shopping if you want to get indoors.Great for a quick Blizzard fix. My son loves the burgers I haven't tried the food besides the blizzardI have to say it appears my idea of a great zoo differs greatly from my fellow yelpers.

This zoo does have some great features.  Fantastic variety of animals from all over the world.  And if you like tigers, this is the zoo for you.  The animals appear well-cared for and the grounds are reasonably clean.

However, it escapes me how this zoo can warrant a five-star rating given the number of "exhibits" that are merely large cages sitting side-by-side like little hotel rooms.  Don't get me wrong, some of the exhibits are great and well-designed.  But many others are terrible and seem to offer little to the animals except shelter.  Perhaps this zoo houses more animals than it can adequately support.

For $18 a ticket, I expect more.
IFor some reason, I was expecting a lot more. This is called the Wildlife WORLD Zoo and Aquarium, but I felt like there weren't as many types of animals as we had hoped. Every time I turned around, it was just another bird cage or another type of antelope. Birds are definitely the "filler" animal at this zoo.

My fiance and I came here using a Groupon, and were happy to get $10 off per ticket, as we would have felt ripped off spending $32 per ticket.Like the previous yelper said! Rating is the service. Usually the food all taste the same! That's why we keep on coming back!!! You will have issues on the service, what do you expect? Most of them are minimum wage kids! They are just starting life! So like any fast food franchise, you get what you paid for! So be patient!This Jamba juice is just okay.
The employees are kinda rude, well most of them.
I've asked to "customize my own smoothie" and this one girl didn't even know what kind of ingredients they had, it was really annoying. I said I didn't want anything orange in my smoothie, and it ended up having orange.

On top of that, it's always really loud, right when you walk in you get a "HELLLOOOO!" then another, "Hello!" "hello!" "hello!"
I found the workers to be really obnoxious.

I do love their smoothies though. If it wasn't for my work being not too far, I really don't think I'd go there.The buffet at this casino is pretty damn good! 

As for the slot machines and poker machines, they are so tight I think they squeak when I walk by! 

My aunt and uncle are Million Point members and have way too many points that they can ever think of using so we always end up eating here when visiting the family in town. 

The food is always hot and in constant rotation. I have yet to meet a dry piece of chicken. Their salad bar is really fresh and clean. I like the dessert bar the best as it has Caramel Creme Ice Cream. The hubby got a scoop and I almost had to knock him out to get another bite. It was that good! I really like that they have an "international" flair to theif buffet because then it doesn't get boring.

I am sure that I wil be back for a buffet next time I am in town as my aunt and uncle will not eat anywhere else.I've been going here on and off for years.  It's not the quickest place in town (they are often fairly busy), but they do a good job at a reasonable price.  Plus they have free wifi, which makes time go by a little quicker.

Look for their Living Social and Groupon deals and you'll save a little $.It is a suburban mall, what more do you want. It is not Walmart, so you can actually get clothes that are stylish in fabrics that do not feel like those brown paper towels, we were forced to use in Grade schoolCarne asada burrito was ok. Salsa bar was good!The service was stellar and the ambiance was impeccable. However; I must have ordered all the wrong things because from what I am reading, I completely missed out. I ordered the chicken, and it was tough, the breading was thick and over-fried. The center of my twice baked potato was cold, we had waited long enough for our order that I did not send it back. The asparagus was soft as though it had been forgotten in the steamer. 
Regardless, the service was excellent and I know we will eat there again, I will just order something different.No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.It was ok......got a pedi and my nail polish chipped two days later! not happy never coming back and waited a while and not so friendly.Used a GroupBuy coupon to engage my 1st purchase at Aurelio's. Some pizza places pride themselves on the cheese, some for the crust, but I believe this place depends on its sauce, and the sauce is good. The crust is like any other Chicago style pizza place, but the cheese was miniscule throughout the order. The soft bread sticks supposedly had Romano cheese, the jalapeno cheese ravioli was pretty hollow but the stuffed crust pizza was a little better. 
I'm a little harder to please because I have some experience in the kitchen.  While I would travel the 8 miles for another shot, I still have yet to find a pizza place that can impress me as I did myself while working at a Little Caesar's parlor and tweeking the ingredients. But for the money I spent, and the gross weight of the food I brought home was probably the one thing that impressed me the most. I find spending $15 anywhere else, I can lift the packaged products with my eyelashes. 
I will suggest to Aurelio's that they invest some belief in their own cuisine. Chicago-style is beast. For them to advertise thin-crust panders to the westerners, California specifically. Thin crust sucks.It's the most convenient AYCE sushi restaurant in the Henderson/Anthem area.  Overall, not a bad place and I'd come again.  But not my favorite in the city.  I'd rather go farther for better.  

The space is clean and spacious.  Authentic Japanese kimonos and artwork line the walls.  

It wasn't busy on the Mother's Day holiday that I went (~25% filled at any given time), but families did come so it was steady.  However, saying that, there should be no excuse as to why we didn't get better service.  We were missing utensils/straws/salad orders and when we reminded the server, he seemed annoyed.  They didn't clear our table as quickly as they brought the food so at one point, we ended up with a few empty dishes cluttering our table.  When we got the check, he had incorrectly charged us more tax than was required.  It's a lot of little things that could have been prevented if someone had been paying more attention.  

The food is delicious and that would be the only reason I'd come back.  My favorites were the Pacific Roll, Hello Kitty Roll, and the Bonzai Roll (if you like sweet + spicy sriracha).  The cucumber salad was disappointing and didn't taste as fresh and crisp as I'm used to.  Free refills for soda are a plus.  

Overall, not a bad experience.  The food balanced the mediocre service.  I'd come again but I'd be coming back more strict.Although the staff at Village East is very friendly, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the services. When my dress was ready to be picked up, I looked it over in the store and saw that it was still dirty at the bottom. I had pointed out specific areas when I dropped it off, so I thought they would be addressed. Denise was accommodating and suggested they re-clean it, which they did. They delivered the re-cleaned dress to my house (which I appreciated) and the dress looked much better.My friend recommended this place to me as a quick, small Sushi place.  I tried it for the first time the other day and it was pretty good. AYCE for about $23.95.

So far my favorite roll is the Sweetheart, shrimp tempura, crab meat and special sauce. When my friend ordered it I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but I was definitely surprised. It's really good.

We didn't really get our money's worth on this trip as we only ordered about 2 rolls each, but I definitely plan on going back with a bigger appetite next time.Cool vibe for an after hours spot, but that place is filled with open use of drugs.  People were in the stalls doing coke and girls were puking on the floor in line for the ladies room.  We had fun but man was that a weird night.This place is cool, not only cause the name, but the hours. The food's pretty good, ordered pho and you can get extra broth for just $1. The service is alright, like any other mom and pop asian place. We had a problem with our check and the man was being very rude about it. I'm sure there are numerous large parties that come through the restaurant and want to split checks or pay partial cash, partial card. The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!I am not sure if this place has come under new ownership, but my last outing here proved very disappointing. Up until recently, this place was my go to after hours food spot in Vegas. However this past time, I found myself unimpressed by the pho, which is surprising since the pho in LA is subpar for the most part. the spring roll also seemed haphazzardly prepared and lack any real flavor. It didn't help that the service was also terrible. VERY IMPORTANT: Call a cab when your entree arrives as there likely won't be one waiting for you between 4- 7 am. if you go to vegas and stay in chinatown, this does not apply to you.Definitely better than it's been over the last few years.  I'm not sure if they waitress was over loaded, absent minded, or just bad at her job, but she kept forgetting stuff.  Another waitress kept picking up her slack, so that was good.The food was delicious and my kids loved it. I did not love the service, though.  The waitress was weird & rude. When she took my order she didn't even look at me... She just walked by, wrote what we wanted, and left with a face of ignorance.This is the first time I ate here in all my years here.  I am surprised I never tried it earlier.  There seems to be a few of these yakiniku spots in the Spring Mountain Chinatown area, although, this place is not bad.  I typically like it when I do not have to go picking my food from a salad bar full of raw meats to cook up...similar to Camelia's back in the islands for my Hawaiian folks.  This place is more like Million's, I take that back...only in the sense that you don't have to pick your own meats to cook and they serve it to you.  Might be scary for some that aren't used to cooking their own food and this style of restaurant, but it is a cultural experience.  Just remember not to make any other plans afterwards...you will be reeking like you just got done working an 8-hour shift in the kitchen.  I know some don't understand the concept of paying to cook your own food, but its a cultural thing again, so this place may not sit well with explorers that are not familiar with Asian culture.  Nothing pisses me off more than wannabe foodies that only blog about burgers and hot dogs and like to bad mouth other food genres.  So if you are not already used to this, try to keep an open mind.  But if you are very particular, do yourself a favor and pass.  Still, I have seen better, but you can surely get your fill for a decent price.I always order their Kimchi fried rice. The beef bowl isn't too bad either. I just wish their sushi roll portions were a bit bigger. They are good though. Oh and if you love sweet, order thier Honeytoast!Most of my visits here have been for lunch.  You need to ask for the lunch menu and it has some great deals.  I always get the lo mein.  The noodles are great and the dish is flavorful.  The fried rice is always good and i'm a sucker for old-school egg rolls.  I have had take out at night that hasn't been very good.They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.

First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. 

So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.

I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). 

I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. 

So overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.Organized store but not good customer services!My friend and I swung in her last night around 10:30 after a show at the Smith Center. Both of us had missed dinner and were starving. The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits.Wasn't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp. But their deep fried King Crab was delicious! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful.Tea Plan.. whoops "Tea Station" has been well established in Vegas for at least a bajillion years which makes it the OG for Asian beverages, or more appropriately the Triad of Asian beverages. 

Pro:

-It is open late as... I don't even know maybe 3am? 
-Offers extensive choices of beverages and limited entrees
-Board games and cards are present
-Orders usually come out pretty quick

Con: 

-$$$ (i.e. $5.75 for a large iced (insert flavor) tea that is 1/2 ice... ice cold man)
-Service is really inconsistent, sometimes its okay, and sometimes you'll probably hate them
- Parking here sucks. I recommend parking at the Chinatown plaza next door and walking over. 
- Skip the food, you'll thank me.
- Doesn't really promote social loitering. Must spend x amount per x length of stay

Side notes:
- Don't come here with intentions of studying, it won't happen.
- Possibility changed their policy on outside food? I ate my street tacos here last time.Updating my review because their service has umphed up an inch. I believe 3 stars are in order for the best boba in Vegas yet still the slowest service & employees that nudge you to leave. In addition, their rule for ALL customers at the table to purchase something is still preposterous (did I just use that word?).It was ok. Nothing to special the food was a hit or a miss .Husband and i went here on a Friday night.  Took the limo, still got charged $25 each.  That included 2 drinks, so not a bad deal. 

Being a couple, the girls are a little more reluctant to approach you.  We got 2 or 3 lap dances and ended up going VIP with one girl.  

VIP is expensive here!  $250 for the half hour, and that doesn't include the $200 bar tab. But it was well worth the money.  Those memories will last a long time...

In general, I think women tend to get better treatment in VIP, but my husband got plenty of attention as well. 

Overall a great experience, but the price will probably have us looking elsewhere next time.

P.S.  I was told if we did bottle service we wouldn't have had to pay cover.Achtung dieses Essen ist gut! 

Better food than the Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas, It has that HOME feel to it.. 
-TIME 
There was only one waitress but the place was not that busy at the time we arrived, she did take care of us (table of 5) in an expedient manner and kept checking on us from time to time. 
-TASTE 
It was nicely crafted food, not salty or bland we shared the the Farmer's Plate, The Schnitzel combo, Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls and they were all great with that home taste although the breaded pork was slightly dry due to overcooking I still ate it....I usually hate cabbage but here was excellent, I would go back and eat just that because its that good, the red cabbage was superb. 
I wont give you a review on each dish because I forgot what was called what.... but I do remember that their pasta was not interesting at all. everything else was great. 
-CLEANLINESS 
The place was clean as expected, the restaurant sits in an older building and it shows but overall I liked the quaint little hole in the wall place it sits in, request a booth because it seats in a more private area than on the front, the front tables feel like sitting at an old cafe/ truck stop type place. 

-THE RUNDOWN 
For the experienced and inexperienced palate, this place will bring you home, great service and great food...a bit pricey but worth it. Don't forget to try their many German Beers, they have a good selection.WAY OVERRATED. What the heck with these who rated 5 stars?  Their green curry used to be much better - it taste like flavored water now. Pad Thai Noodle is OK, but it's pretty closed to what you eat at a food court in your local shopping mall. Price is OK. Service is OK. But they don't deserve 5 stars, dude.Que Club is located in Commercial Center near Maryland and Sahara.  Commercial Center isn't the nicest area that you'll probably see, but it has gotten slightly better than what it used to be.  There's plenty of tables located inside Que Club.  A couple arcade games located near the front, and they have regulation tables, smaller tables and the extra large tables.  They also have a glow in the dark table for those who want that cosmic pool table feeling.  Prices are decent.  There's also plenty of asian food to eat around the area.We love hitting up restaurants that are way off-strip and WAY less expensive whenever we're in Vegas. 

We decided to go for some Japanese one night. Took us awhile to find this spot because of course our GPS got us lost. This restaurant is located in this dinky, scary-looking shopping center with the biggest parking lot ever and not enough stores opened. We knew we were in for some good food considering our lives were probably in danger once we parked here. (Hole-in-the-walls are awesome)

Walking into this restaurant I noticed how run-down and old the interior was. We were seated at this booth and the wallpaper was peeling and probably had some mold back there. Eeeeeep! Not the kind of hole-in-the-wall I was expecting!

I didn't feel like doing AYCE like the bf did but opted for their salmon teriyaki which came with a salad, soup, tempura and some rice. My food came out way later than the bf's order since he ordered off the AYCE menu. I'd have to say, I was still pretty hungry after my meal but definitely didn't wanna be stuffed and looking like a balloon later that night for our clubbing adventure. 

I feel like some of the fish they serve here isn't the freshest and the way they cut their sushi wasn't too generous either. 

I liked the K-Pop music videos they had playing while we were grubbing.

I also liked the fact that this place was almost completely empty when we walked in.

But then again...maybe there's a reason why it was empty (the food! bleh!)I'm not a fan of filipino fast food but when you really want filipino food and you are away from your mom, this is one of the few places you can go to and get it done right.  Really in love with their barbecue and palabok.  Sometimes I feel like the portion sizes are too big but then I rememeber I can just take it home and have it the next day as my BAON.  lolPretty good place! The girl in the front was really nice, and I suppose the whole staff too. I got the buffet to go and it was nice because you could get everything you want in the container for $8.75! The food is really basic though, like how a buffet should be. Just some food to get you full, although some of the entrees were a little dry. Overall it was good!The 3 stars are for Walmart stores, this location however gets 2 stars. It's not so much the location of the store but some of the customers it brings in....some very interesting characters which wouldn't surprise me to be found on peopleofwalmart.com.Paid for the yelp coupon to have someone tell me that I needed a new water softener.  Glad that didn't cost me the normal $80.  The service person was ok.  He was nice but like I said, it wasn't worth the cost.**Summary**

**Recommendations**
       - This is a great alternative to Quizno's and Subways. The price isn't too steep and the food's decent.This place was okay, portions were big.. I had the prime rib, baked potato and lobster bisque soup.  The soup had a big chunk of lobster in it which was a pleasant surprise but the actual bisque was a little on the salty side.  Had a good taste to it, creamier bisque, was good.  The baked potato was good, who could mess that up and the prime rib was cooked good, just wasn't as tender as I'm used to.. flavor was lacking, bland.  Waiter was real flamboyant, told us he was the waiter, cashier and I think he said even did some of the cooking.. he was attentive but a smart a$$..We ate here for the Friday night seafood buffet and the Sunday Brunch over Memorial day weekend.

Overall it was good. They had great variety of food. They had snow crab legs on Friday night. They only thing I didn't care for they were not already pre-split to where you could easily get the meat out. I felt as though I was wasting allot of meat. We usually have scissors we take with us and I wish we hadn't of forgot them. But again overall it was good. 

We then went for Sunday champagne brunch.  They had asian items, mexian, breakfast and roast beef along with may other sides. Just wished they would have had more fresh fruit selection.  Also considering it was champagne brunch we never once were offered any and didn't see any out for us to get. I seen only 3 people near us get champagne and they seemed to be locals the way they were greeted by the waitress and knew to ask for it.

Oh and don't thong about going to go get your own drink from the soda foutain. The waitress yelled at me as I picked up a glass and said that someone would be to my table to get my drink selection. 

But since we had a buy one get one half off coupon for brunch and got it for $5 a person we were happy.Food was good. Service was terrible. Our party of 6 had to ask for things multiple times, from several waiters. When he came to drop off the check, he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for more water. He dropped off the check and never came back. The whole table, including myself, laughed in just disbelief.A friend is doing rehab here.  It's an OK place.  He had to get a bit demanding before they got his gluten free diet into their heads.  

Hallways and rooms are clean.  Some of the staff need a bit of customer service education, but there are several I've met who are quite pleasant and efficient.

It's hard reviewing a place you'd rather not be.It has been several years since I have visited this establishment and not much had changed in the many years since. I have always liked the open grill as you walk in. We had a cocktail as we waited for friends to arrive, unfortunately the draft beer was flat and somewhat stale. We then took our seats and were greeted promptly by the wait staff. The overall service was friendly and efficient.

We ordered our food which was delivered in an appropriate amount of time considering how busy the place was. One of our party ordered the porterhouse medium well, it came to us well done and charred on one side. I had the Smoked Prime Rib, it was very good and full of flavor. We as a group were not impressed with the cheesy potato's. They had an odd consistency, and flavor was not that appetizing given how they were raved about.

Over all a good experience, not sure how soon I would go back. Due to the drive not sure it was worth the travel time.I can agree with my fellow yelper.. they are sometimes very slow, not only at the pharm. but at the regular check out.

believe it or not I like Wal-Green for their selection on Toothpaste.
They are a bit pricey to, thier sale prices are what average cost is. I only buy sale items from wal-g

They will also refill your ink cartrigdes for cheap, I've done that a few times already.Pretty decent place to get a nice massage.  The prices are the bomb.  You get a very good massage at a reasonable price.  What they charge you in the casino is a major ripoff.  If you are looking for a "spa casino experience,"  (high prices & faux decor), this is not the place for you.  Think of it as more of a "massage clinic."

You go in, get a very good massage, and get out.  That's how I like it.  No fluff, no high prices.

This place is clean and the people giving you the massage are very attentive to your needs.  Since you are face down most of the time, does your massage feel better if you are in one of those pretty casino spas?  Heck no.

Reasonable price, best kept secret in town.  Come here and save your money for food & drink.  For those of you that rely on pictures of the SPA, all the pictures on their website are just decorations.

I believe in TRUTH IN ADVERTISING.  It's no shame to advertise that you are set up like a massage clinic.  They could get better ratings if they didn't use all those "fake" spa pictures on their website.  Don't be embarrassed.  You win on price, quality, and value.My bro swears by this place and every time they go to LV, they always make a pit-stop to KJ Kitchen. I never knew LV had a Chinatown. LV's Chinatown is different - it's actually CLEAN!

This is a pretty big restaurant and a lot of people frequent this establishment. I saw a lot of Chinese patrons eating here which is definitely a good sign.

Our party ordered the following:
-Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($12)
-Sweet and Sour Pork ($8)
-Lo-Mein House Special ($9)
-Beef with Chinese Broccoli ($8)

The food was descent for the prices. I did find the food to be super greasy. I needed to drink a lot of water and green tea to coat the stomach. The portions were generous and we had leftovers, which we couldn't bring with us. 

Service was good and attentive, and by the time we left, there was a line out the door. 

This place was far from the strip. So if you feel like local Asian food, come to Chinatown.I was sent here to get x-rays done when I was in a car accident.  Nothing got screwed up, so I was happy with the job they did.  The guy that did my x-rays was pleasant to chat with while he worked.I would definitely stay here again. I wasn't expecting luxury by any means but I also wasn't expecting it to be as decent as it was. We needed a last minute place to stay and booked a room for that night for $50. You get what you pay for, and those that complain about how grungy it was should have known that when they booked it. It is pretty far off the strip, but not nearly as far as Hard Rock. They sell $1.50 Bud Lights at the bar inside which is always a plus. I joined the Owl Club to get the $200 free slot play. I didn't win anything but I didn't lose anything either. The people that worked the counter were friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and had a television, what more can you ask for? Like I said, I definitely would stay here again when I was looking for a cheap hotel option in Vegas.

Oh and just a warning, the walls are REALLY thin and you can hear pretty much everything going on in the room next to you. If you are going to Vegas for a quiet experience you are in the wrong place anyways.

Also, DO NOT go to the Hooters inside the hotel. Its absolutely awful. (see my other review)I give it 3.5 stars!

I'm a fan of Schlotzsky's, have been since I was a kid. 

For those who've never been, it's basically a sub shop. It's their bread more than anything that sets them apart. Their bread is sponge like, hard to explain but tasty.

I've known Schlotzsky's forever, and I noticed this place out of the corner of my eye driving through Vegas. So we stopped in. I ordered the Original, my gf ordered the smoked turkey and guacamole and our friend ordered the chicken chipotle. We all ordered the medium size, unless you're super starving or sharing, stick with the medium. The large is just huge. 

I was totally satisfied, and so was our traveling companion. My gf though, not so much. I think I know why. The smoked turkey they use is really smoking. I wasn't sure if it was turkey or johnny walker black label in the sandwich. I think if it was regular oven roasted turkey, she'd like it a lot more. 

I'd go back, and I wish we had them in LA.The store is very spacious and contains a McDonald's and other mini-stores inside.
There was a small spill in one of the isles and I was surprised how fast the janitor got there. 
I made my way toward the tech section and noticed that there were no employees to be found. There wasn't even a person manning the mobile section as there should be. 
The lines were a bit long , I spent a good 9 minutes in line.
Overall I had an OK experience and will be returning again.What can you say about Wal-Mart... It's Wal-Mart!

I think the thing I like is the super-store so I can get everything in one spot.  No need to shop around, overall they have the lowest prices and if you found lower, it wouldn't be worth the cost of gas to save a few cents.

I will buy pantry items but don't trust the meat and the produce is OK but kind of lower grade products.It's like every other walmart; it's busy on the weekends, friendly workers/customer service is hit or miss, there's usually some level of random items totally out of place (which is not the employees fault; in a store so big it's going to take a bit before someone notices a DVD in the cracker section). 

One thing I have noticed is that the outdoor area in the garden center is often very difficult to get a cart around in. Right after Christmas it was packed with boxes of clearance items and I made the mistake of trying to look and got my cart stuck. Went there again today and I was looking at the plants and there were bags of soil on the ground that blocked the path. I guess if you head toward that section, you better leave your cart behind if you want to get through.Grade: C

Think about it. Italian food in Verona, WI... Yeah. The bartendresses are the hottest in Dane County. This is worth the trip out to Verona.I couldn't give this place a better score because of the prices and the selection, but that's not really why anyone shops here. It's a good place for those to get a few last minute groceries for those who live downtown. I just finally went to Fresh Madison Market and might start going there from now on. This place is closer though, so who knows.The hotel is pretty nice and the staff are helpful.  two complaints: the wireless internet is very slow, and the housekeeping staff is very loud and woke everyone up in my room - they spoke very loudly and were throwing things around for about 45 minutes.  we called and complained.Great homemade noodles. Below average thai green curry. Average tofu. No air conditioning even on 80+ degree humid day.Like the other guy said - useful if another restaurant is packed (like the Old Fashioned on the night  I went there).  

Wouldn't be my first choice though since the scene is completely dead here.  There were a couple elderly couples there, but that's basically it.  Not exactly where you want to spend your sat night...

Pluses include good prices on specials here (greek/mediterranean mostly), and a very flamboyant, entertaining main waiter.Not sure who the other reviewer worked with, but I've never had a bad experience with Rubin's.  Some pieces are lackluster, but the store is generally reliable.  Alternative comp is Century House.Great bar!

But the food here stinks. Nothing I hate more than being severed cold fries.This place is crazy.  It has always been busy when I've stopped in, and it's clear why.  They have a helpful staff, huge selection, and reasonable prices.  The one thing that could make it better would be a larger parking lot.  If you're coming to pick something up on any weekend evening, I recommend coming by foot or bike because parking gets limited.  In the past I have had to wait 5-10 minutes in my idling car before a spot became available.Once you get in, it's fine ... the problem is that you may die waiting. 

Maybe I was spoiled with Columbia / St. Mary's hospitals in Milwaukee, but this location took nearly two hours during the early afternoon of a work day. I sat there with a potential blood clot; old SARS victims were hacking away and I could have sworn that an elderly person sat there with cob webs growing on her. Horrible. 

It gets a positive review overall because the care and patient care is considerate, kind and intelligent.I've been to Takara many times in the past, and ordered takeout recently only to be disappointed.  As far as I'm concerned, their entrees and cooked dishes are far better than their sushi.  The soba noodles are delicious, the sushi, not so much.  I ordered a Naruto and an Iso fantastic roll, both of which were gigantic.  I don't think you should have to cut a piece of sushi into pieces just to be able to eat it, but with the rolls at Takara, you do.  The fish seemed semi fresh, and the rice was well cooked, but both the rolls I ordered at least 3 inches in diameter and had an inch layer thick of rice, which made them hard to eat.  One positive thing I will say is that their house ginger dressing is amazing, and I'd recommend the house salad.  Overall, I really used to like this place, but my most recent experience was a bit sub par.  Skip the sushi and go for the entrees.Good Ritas, but the meal was a litte underwhelming. My rice and beans seemed to have that look of having been plated hours previously and the pork tacos had no real zing. My wife's rellano was nice but had one too many cheeses stuffed in it. Eat inside for more comfortable tables.Excellent food.  Horrible front-end service.Pretty tasty, but accepts no cards, and usually has a long wait. I can't say it stands above other pancake/breakfast places around the city but it's certainly not bad and very cheap!Generally pretty good.  As takeout Chinese places go, the food is decently seasoned, not oversalted or oversauced,  and reasonably fresh.  A few items on the menu lean towards the greasy - the chicken and blackbean hofun noodles, for example, are difficult enough to eat without being over-lubricated with cooking oil.  The soups are slightly bland - while the idea of a soup with dumplings and fish balls is a solid one, the broth is bit on the weak side.

However, there are a few less-standard menu items worth trying - the "lemongrass pork chop", while not strictly traditional, is moist and tender and full of good lemongrass flavor.  The weekend congee menu is also the real deal - it's homestyle enough that it attracts a large crowd of international students, and the congee is delicious (which is saying something for a rice porridge).  They don't skimp on the additions (I'm partial to the sliced pork and preserved egg), and the available special appetizers (spicy beef tripe, fried bread, chicken feet with black bean) are worth trying.  Their homemade chili-garlic sauce is a winner, too - spicy and garlicky, it's worth picking up a jar (which they sell at the counter).  It's oily, so is best used in small quantities, but is really quite delicious.

Service is primarily counter-based, and a bit on the charmingly grumpy side, although some may find it less charming than others.Pretty good - pricier than we were expecting!I have a love-hate relationship with Bluephie's.

Love: their food is delicious and rather inexpensive. I've been for brunch and lunch, and have never been disappointed.

Hate: they act like a fine dining restaurant, but serve diner food and have plastic menus. Make up your mind, Bluephie's!

Bluephie's also lists itself as a vodka bar, which I've never gotten to try, but sounds like it would be pretty legit.

Must try: blueberry muffin french toast. Seriously, you'll be upset if you don't order it, especially if someone else at the table does.Good sports bar atmosphere....go there for beer 'n' Badgers, but not the food.  The nachos were the worst I've ever had--seriously.  And what was that other horrendous concoction?  Oh yes. PIZZA QUESADILLAS.  if it had been up to me, I wouldn't have ordered it, because...C'MON, MAN!  Pizza. Quesadillas.  Two words that have no business being next to each other.  And as expected...Really. Truly. Disgusting.

But the Hopalicious was A-okay.This is my favorite place to come for fish fry (fish and chips to anyone outside of the Midwest).  There's not one thing I dislike about this dish here.  Perfectly battered cod with a crispy outside and moist flaky center, perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a great tarter sauce (so often overlooked).  It is all you can eat which includes both the fries and the cod.  There's no reason you should leave this place hungry.   One plate is usually enough anyways. 

If you like the Friday fish fry but want to avoid the crowd I would suggest visiting Quivey's on a Wednesday.  They offer the same all you can eat special for both lunch and dinner but without the hour and a half wait.  

So about the service.  The last few times I've been here the service has been great.   Unfortunately this hasn't always been the case, and I've known others that have had a similar experience.  I hope things have turned around.  I really enjoy dinning here and for a time the food was the only thing I found exceptional.It was okSufficient Vietnamese food for Madison. They serve alvacado smoothies. The woman owner is a little snooty and not great for take-out, therefore, they don't get 4 stars.Overall a decent chinese restaurant. Service is quick and always ready in 10-15 minutes. One caveat to all of this is: AVOID THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. It is a total let down. As an alternative may I suggest the Hunan chicken (not as spicy as you'd think), the General Tso's (also not as spicy, but spicy enough for me), or the Crab Rangoon (don't even think about reheating them - they must be consumed in one sitting). 

One more thing to avoid - the low mein. It's a bit flavorless and limp. I keep trying it, hoping I just got a bad batch, but no such luck.Perhaps my disdain for Phoenix Sky Harbor is bleeding over into the big US Airways carrier there, but I'm hardly enthused about the joint.

Firstly, it always seems that they can't pull it together. Southwest suffers this same fate here, so perhaps it really is the curse of the airport, but my gates always change, things are always delayed, and that's a serious pain at PHX.

What I do like is that you've got plenty of options. As noted, they are indeed a big carrier at this 'port, so you've got a bunch of departures and arrivals to choose from, and you can link up to a lot of places across the US. 

Are they my favorite carrier? Hardly. Kinda chintzy. But they sometimes win the price/convenience war and they're not so bad that you won't take them up on saving a few bucks every so often in PHX.If you actually go by the term "A-OK" that goes along with 3 stars on the Yelp rating system, then Alterations... is just that.  I give them a fair amount of regular business for both dry cleaning and tailoring (hey, I'm a 23 year old, trying to look like a 23 year old, in a 12 year old's body).  The actual work done is good and very standardized.  For example: I wanted a shirt taken in; it was done, and done well, but when I showed up a few hours earlier than what was listed on my ticket, they turned me away...(?)

I would recommend interfacing with the men as opposed to the women (I just feel like their customer service is less rigid, more my stilo).It is always about service....and Saturday night, I think that service was lacking in so many ways.

I am going to start at the end of the night first.  There were 9 of us at the table, all of us talking and eating.  Slowly but surely, the server removed our plates.  When she removed the last plate...she plopped down the check...even after we told her that it was my friends birthday.  I asked my birthday friend if we were getting dessert and she asked why..."because here is the check"  So my friend asked her if we can see a dessert menu.  The server replied, "Oh I am sorry...since nobody said anything to me, I assumed that you were all finished."  Wow...what a way to upsell the tab...

i have to say that even with that exchange....the server had absolutely no personality.  The food was good.  (The wine pairings for $30 is what peaked our interest...but because one of our friends wasn't going to participate - - -her pregnancy may have had something to do with that - - - the table wasn't allowed to take part in the wine dinner.  BOO!!!)  The eggplant looked good, my burger was, well, a burger, and the desserts were amazing.  And one couldn't go wrong with 1/3 off bottles of wine.  Especially nice since I had an awesome Shiraz.  

I wouldn't outrule going here again.  I didn't get the "wine bar" feel of the place especially since the food wasn't the most wine appealing.  I just hope our next server has more PAZAZZ!!!!!!I never heard of this outfit until I moved over here from L.A. at the beginning of '09.  I see on their Website that they have stores all the way across the South & Southwest, but not in California.  Now, it has taken me all this year-and-a-half plus to try the place, a stone's throw from my house, but today I finally made it!

I found a clean, comfortable dining room here, an easy to follow menu, friendly service, & low prices.  That's certainly a start!  SO, I ordered a burger, fries, & a vanilla shake.  Creative, huh?    :-))

My "Whataburger" was a good husky burger with better taste than a Whopper or Jumbo Jack, I think.  The fries were hot & crispy & the shake good...  not as special as the ones at Jack in the Box or Carl's Jr., but also much less expensive.

Whataburger Combo w/shake upgrade:  $5.83

Everything was right about this place, & I like it!Stopped here on a Saturday early afternoon, because someone had recommended it to me. We split a meatball parm hero, and a slice of cheese pizza. Everything was fairly good. In fairness, I bet the pizza is better freshly made than reheated, so I do plan to go to try. I am really interested in trying some pasta dishes and definitely the lasagna. 
The place was completely dead when we were there, but it sounds like this place does most of its business with the office lunch crowd.  Plus we were there at a late lunch hour for a Saturday. So no big shock. We talked to Pino for a bit.  He is a very nice man. He is from south of Naples, and he has that European spirit to him. He speaks passionately about his ingredients, about Italy and so on. 
If I had just gotten this same food delivered, I am not sure if I would make a point to be back soon. But knowing more about the ingredients he uses, and his variety of dishes, I am looking forward to going back and trying other things including a freshly made pizza.Ya know, this place isn't half bad for a bowling alley. I came here last night with some friends of mine to do the cosmic bowling and we actually had a good time. From the outside it doesn't look like anything special, but the insides in pretty decent shape.

There's a bar inside, and you can get your drink and food on in here if you like, or take it with you to the lanes.  The bartender we had was sort of cranky and kept spewing all these rules about how it's one drink at a time and we had to get bracelets to prove we were of age if we wanted more drinks. I'm sorry, I thought prohibition ended a long time ago? I was unaware that beer should be rationed for adults. If I go to a bar, they can't seem to shove enough booze in my face, but here? ONE AT A TIME PLEASE!  I obliged since I didn't want the bartender punching me in the face for being sassy...just sayin.

Lanes were nice, but halfway through our game the scoring thing died so we had to switch lanes.  Kind of a pain in the butt, but hey, it's not like we're going to quit halfway through!  Staff was nice and friendly, overall not the typical dirty bowling alleys that I'm used too.After an exhaustive move on Friday, my friend Austin and I were completely exhausted.  I had been up since 4 AM, moved across town and was ready to eat my right arm if I didn't feed myself and Austin for helping me out.

I knew this place was close to me, but its literally less then a mile from my new place. Austin and I cruised in, starving, and took a seat.  I don't know what I was expecting with the decor here, but it was a bit divey for what I was expecting.  Not bad divey, just more then I had anticipated.  I was emaciated, so I could have cared less at that point, but it was "cute" none the less.

Anyways, there was a bunch of TV's over the bar with some hockey games on and other sports stuff.  A few old dudes were drinking beer and watching the game, and Austin and I sat and stared off into a coma while we waited for our server.

We both went with burgers, but I got the sweet potato fries, and Austin went with the regular fries.  My burger and fries were tasty, as was Austins (at least he said he liked it and it was quite tasty.)

Anyways, there's a few points as to why I deducted a star for this review.  First off, the booth we sat in was worthless. I literally SUNK into the booth seat and there was nothing there.  No cushioning, busted springs and it felt horrifically uncomfortable! Made me want to get up and leave!  I was so exhausted that I didn't have the strength, but I was miserable physically while I sat here. Felt like I was sitting on a piece of worthless wood with crappy vinyl over it.

Secondly, even though our service was fine overall, we waited FOREVER for our bill, and I mean FOREVER. We were hot, tired and physically wiped out, and we had to chase the girl down and beg her to get our bill.  She walked by our table at least a zillion times, and even though we had clearly been done eating for quite some time, she completely ignored us. I had tried to get her attention politely with eye contact, as did Austin, but nothing.  Finally, after quite a while, I hollered for her, and she brought us our bill like nothing was wrong.  Annoying!

Overall, I thought the place was okay.  I will probably go back, as it seems to be a fun place to hang out with some dart boards in the back and the food is pretty decent.Not as nice as other savers I've been too. Maybe I was just disappointed because I drove a half hour and didn't find anything.  Also, they don't have any 50% off colors on Fridays which was a bummer too.Finally made it out to Great Wall for dim sum. I've been hearing so much about this place but I am hardly ever in this area so it was sitting in my "to try" list for quite some time. Walking in, I thought, this is gonna be legit. The place was packed to the rim with asian people waiting to get their dim sum on. The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact). 

We didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.

In summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!Not Bad! Best Produce in the Valley!It often smells like portapotties outside but if you can withstand it the tacos inside are decent. You can call your order in ahead which is quite convenient since it seems everyone in line ahead of you takes forever to decide on their order. The salsas are good but there all out in the open :/I went to Oriental for lunch on a recent weekday with a family member who was in town.  I've been here 3-4 times previously, but it had been almost a year since my last visit.  There was a decent sized crowd when we ordered our takeout.  The wait based on the crowd size seemed a little bit long, but not horrible.

I ordered a side of crab rangoon (4 pieces) and a bowl of chicken fried rice.  The rangoon were great.  Nice and crispy, with a very flavorful filling on the inside...I'd say there was almost too much cream cheese filling...but how can that be a bad thing???  The chicken fried rice was ok.  Pretty sure that I've ordered this on previous visits.  One thing that I didn't remember (or maybe it has changed) was that there were bean sprouts in the meal.  Bleh.  I'm not a fan.  Luckily, they weren't too prevalent, but still, I did not like that.  

Will I go to Oriental Express again?  Oh probably.  At the very least, the rangoon are quite good, and I do remember having some good chicken teriyaki there.  If I get the fried rice again, I'll have to remember to order without sprouts.People love to rag on Desert Sky Mall, like it's an American Idol contestant or a homeless person. Like your criticism is essential to its existence.

"It's too small. They have nothing good. It's so cheap and dirty. It's a shit mall. You're better off going to Arizona Mills or Arrowhead."

Like the people who drive all the way out to Westgate and still manage to muster the inanity to complain of how it isn't Scottsdale, these same jibbajabberers clearly have no grasp on the area and its economic status. They don't live here (surprise), and make a point to mention EVERY TIME they visit the west side how much they hate it.

Yeah, fuck you too.

Sure, Desert Sky is ghetto. Because IT'S IN the ghetto.

There's a reason so many people take the bus to this mall. It's not because they're environmentally aware. 

To better illustrate the socio-economic climate of Desert Sky, I have prepared a neatly compiled bullet-point presentation. 

* At any given moment, one or more stores in DSM is going out of business. Some don't even make it over the 6 month hump. So if you see something in that smoke shop you really like, better get while you're there, because next year it'll be a perfumery. 

* They can't even afford decent food court food. Other malls have Orange Julius and Hot Dog on a Stick. They get Flaming Wok (who carries the exact same menu as Panda Express but still manages to somehow be less authentic) and a Subway counter staffed by seemingly invisible sandwich artists. 

* And you thought the "free samples" guy at your mall was annoying. DSM has the most aggressive kiosk workers in all of mall-hood. Their cell phone plan is such an affordable value that they're willing to barrel through other patrons and ambush you behind signs and walls to let you know how awesome their deals are. Sure, you didn't want that sugar-coated nut, but at least nobody was injured in the process. Except maybe the underpaid workers whose nut-harvesting skills were exploited by their cheapskate employer. 

* It's pretty common knowledge that one of the department stores (hint; shares it's name with an island and a type of blue-colored liqueur) will issue you a store credit card on the spot. No application process. No waiting period. No wonder everyone comes here packing heat. All these people in holey shirts and torn up jeans walking out of stores with brand new stereos and speakers, their faces shifty with looks of guilt and/or disbelief. 

* The "special attractions" here blow. Business is so bad the caricaturist is closed on weekends. ON WEEKENDS. I went to the mall yesterday and the Santa they brought in had ONE kid waiting in line to get their picture taken. One. People can't even afford to TELL Santa what they want for Christmas. Woe upon the world.

* The Steve and Barry's here is closing down. How FUBAR'd is the economy when not even the combined endorsements of Amanda Byrnes, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the WWE can sell your 9 dollar jeans?

* I have on more than one occasion been asked by fellow patrons not to eat my Pretzel Time in front of their kids, or they'll be forced to explain to them why they can't afford such snacks. I would have given them my pretzel, but being originally from Philadelphia I douse mine in yellow mustard, and 99 percent of the people I've come across find it repulsive.

* Did I mention that this is one of the only malls (if not the only) in the whole state that can only afford to have ONE story?

So please, before you pass judgment on this calamitous and downtrodden mall, please take into consideration the geography and economy of the area and its consequences on neighboring businesses.

Translation: STFU, n00b.Desert Sky did such a good job of reinventing itself as a big neighborhood mall for a largely Hispanic, working-class neighborhood that the Wall Street Journal did an article about it.

If you're not from the neighborhood, visiting is kind of an anthropological experience, and you need to be up for that more than for "quick! find what I need!" shopping. One former store is now Curacao, which is sort of the Latin American version of the old Service Merchandise, only with a focus on offering consumer credit to the underbanked. (Remember catalog showrooms? So 1980s!) 

The mall stores are a mix of familiar retail chains and local stores. The local ones do come and go; but in our chain-centric world, I think it's cool to see local entrepreneurial spirit. Apparently the locals do, too, as on a weekend afternoon, the place is packed.

Another entire former department store -- I think it's the old Mervyn's -- is now an indoor swap meet. So really, you will have the best time if you're in the mood for an indoor swap meet but also need to pick up a couple of things from a major chain store and also have a craving for some Mexican street food and maybe spiced nuts. Desert Sky can do that thing, and it can do it with mariachi performances in center court.My rating is mostly for the service, which was incredibly friendly :).  However the way the food is setup is like a buffet style but they dish it out for you is cheesy and cafeteria like.  And, as always with that style, you're never really sure how long that food has been sitting there.  We had the teriyaki chicken with white rice and it looked delicious but the sauce was so unbelievably plain that it was not good at all.  Egg rolls were average.  Maybe if they have something like General Tsao's (which I didn't see on the menu) I would try it.I love pizza but didnt like howthe edges of the deep dish were so hard :( next time will order thin crust, sauce is really good here:)Decent Mexican but far from Top Shelf.  

They are a bit overpriced for what you get as I got one taquito with beans and rice for $8.  

Salsa is a bit watery for my taste and not spicy enough.  

Rice and beans were good and that is more than a lot of Mexican places can say.  

Service was great I got a drink refill before I even asked for it and that means a lot to me.I thought Top Shelf was good! As good as Macayo's or Valle Luna.  Had the grilled fish tacos. Fish was good but was served as a typical taco with flour tortilla, tomato, lettuce and cheese. That was kind of a disappointment. Others in the party enjoyed their food and I really liked the rice and beans! Service was great!Not the only Fry's in this neighborhood, but definitely the better of the two. This location is a large Fry's (but not a Marketplace store), and it's starting to show its age. It's still clean, however, and despite the feeling it always gives me of being too full of products (mountains of them), it's not cluttered.

This location has a decent produce section, a deli and separate bakery, liquor aisles, a floral section, a bunch of freezer cases, and a full service pharmacy. Service at this location is good, and there always seem to be employees around if you need assistance.

The rest of the mall area is dying, with the next door Walmart having closed its doors in 2008. That's good news for Fry's shoppers, because it's now possible to get in and out of the parking lot without a near crash.I've had 4/6 of my tattoos done here. They do an incredible job and all of the artists are really professional and amazing at what they do. My reason for giving it less than 5 stars is that I often feel like their pricing is a bit wonky. 

For instance, my first visit there was inspired by two very small tattoos I was interested in getting. I learned the shop minimum was $50 and each tattoo was small enough that that is all they would cost. When I went to the front to pay, they charged me the shop minimum twice....since I had left with two tattoos. Now, if you had connected the two, they would not have equaled more than the shop minimum, and if they did, they were definitely not DOUBLE the price. This perturbed me, but I still came back in the future as they did an incredible job.

My most recent experience was even more infuriating as I paid in full for a piece that was going to take two sessions. At the end of my first session, I scheduled my follow-up and the receptionist wrote down PAID IN FULL next to my name. After the second session ended, I was then charged an additional $150 on top of what I had already spent and was told that I hadn't, in fact, paid in full the first time. 

Word to the wise, get everything they say IN WRITING! The receptionist wrote this comment in pencil and it easily could have been erased. Just a warning! But besides this fact, I do feel every piece I received there was done superbly, even with the additional charges tacked on. Just don't appreciate being told something and it changing in the future.I love this place's prices - and usually their wide variety - cannot be beat. But 2x now I've discovered ants in my home shortly after shopping there thanks to produce left on the counter.  And I HATE ants.  So I'm just going to be lazy and shop at Safeway :(Bavarian Point has very good German food, but is a heck of a drive to get to. I also made the pilgrimage for a friends Birthday. 

I stuck with what I know: Brats and Saurkraut. The Saurkraut was delicious. The Brats were pretty good, although I think that they gave me a sausage mixture. 

Different friends ordered different plates, so I got to see a little of everything that was ordered. 

Helpings are generous, Décor is dated, menu is solid German, and salad bar is questionable (is it German? or just a salad bar?)...Was In the area and found it on yelp ..liked the picture of the stuffed burger so ordered 2 to go  and went over the the butcher side and bought allot of wonderful stuff, pot pie and steaks, loved it..!! as i went through the bakery to pick up my burgers bought some sweets ...yum... Not so Impressed with the burgers ..Wanted to get back to the butcher so I took a friend for lunch and It was confirmed the restaurant sucks....:( sorry the rolls hard my friend "steak" awful they told us the NY strip was thicker ..??!?!? I cant see how It was soo thin...my Philly  had hard bun the meat was to thick and awful ..But I will continue to shop at the meat market  always looking for good quality meat and they do  ..Something goes very wrong with the meat on it way to the resturant ..!?!? Maybe a new COOK oh and the stringbeans with tomato side from a can disgusting ....SORRY ..!!!?!Extremely slow service, if you order pizza it is quick, otherwise slow.  Quality has really dropped.Its ok, but I got sick from the corn dog. The cherry limeaide is alwayse a winner though.The big Julio's is closed and transformed into a breakfast place but I am so happy that Julio's Too has survived. Good, cheap, Mexican food. Two people could easily split a combo for a super-cheap lunch. Their take out is fast or there is a small seating area inside the restaurant. Or, to pick up dinner on the way home you can call ahead and have it waiting for you. I love that they serve beer bottles to go!I used to enjoy this for lunch on occasion - Sorry to say it CLOSED a couple months ago... I think "Julio's Too" is still open.Went here on Friday because they were having a great deal on some skillets I have been looking at. I had gone to Sur la Table earlier in the day for another item and my experiences at these two places were quite different.

Everyone here was very nice and quickly asked if I needed any help as I was browsing which was great. However, whenever I asked a specific question they had little to no knowledge of a good answer. Anything from "I think this is priced wrong" to "Do you know the difference between this style pan and that?" each question was met with fumbling around for words or them needing to ask a manager... and I thought I was asking pretty simple questions.

The selection here is great for specialty items, but if you are going here for pots, pans or knives my experience with the three different people that I spoke with was that they knew very little about the products they sold and had zero hands on experience with them.

Very nice people... just wouldn't feel comfortable buying anything off their recommendations and will look elsewhere to buy my equipment.Oh Kona Grill, how you bring back memories.  

I first discovered Kona Grill's happy hour back in college, the lure of the $2.50 Ladies Margarita and the half price happy hour menu fit right in to my college budget!  Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.

I went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!

It was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.

I know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!Good happy hour prices. Vegas roll here is delish and so is there pizza.Pet peeves of mine include expensive sushi that doesn't wow me, oh, and snobs. The customers who drive up in their super expensive cars and think this place is the s***? Hmm.. doesn't impress me. That's Scottsdale for ya.

I do have to admit that the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon was pretty good (shrimp and pork fried rice, with veggies), but the California rolls were just meager and overpriced. Kris had the pad thai noodles, which he says was pretty tasty. Very white-washed, don't expect any type of authentic asian food. I believe I said this place is like a P.F. Chang's, but Japanese style.We hadn't been here in a while. After shopping, we decided to have an early dinner. I order the Pad Thai and my wife had the Maui Tacos. 
For me, since the Maui Tacos aren't on the menu, the way they were made looked much more different than when they were on the menu. The fried rice looked wet  and the tacos weren't wrapped as nice. But my wife still loved it.
My Pad Thai was filled with a lot of chicken and shrimp. The chicken meat was cut is large chunks. Overall, I would rate this entree a B.
Our lemonade was really watered down. I let mine set for about 10 minutes before drinking it. I should have asked for another one, but I was almost done with my meal and had been drinking water.
The server, Diane, was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our glasses were filled with water.Nice patio and large enough for a crowd.  X-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the Friends opening credit - Yes, I'll be there for you!

Came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!

Regardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!Always a fun time! A great time to meet up with friends and taste all the great beers & food around the Scottsdale.Great place to hang out and relax, especially during night time and on the weekend.  Good location, just a few miles south of Old Town Scottsdale.  This may even been the nicest location I've seen for years.Let me put it this way yelpers...I would not request to go to this place, but if my group wanted to go here I wouldn't have to be dragged kicking and screaming. 
Walking up, this place looks pretty cool. It reminds me of an upscale Gilligan's. The decor is awesome, with some of the comfy seats. The seating in this lounge makes it easy to talk with your group or even start a conversation with a new group. 
Unfortunately this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My experience was short lived at drift. The staff was a little snotty for my taste (People we are here to have a good time, put a smile on), and the drinks were pretty weak for what the price was. Not a good combo. My advice is get a little toasted at a cheap place before you go here. Their drinks aren't worth the money. 
I only stayed for one beverage at this place, not by any fault of drift I have to say. I had a creepy guy follow me around the whole night. It goes back to that great seating that makes it easy to make good friends...I guess it was a little too much of a good thing.Ordered fajitas-pretty good 
My sister go chilie relleno- even better

It's kinda cool here outside seating-although river feels a little cheesy/man made/disney like-I don't really get it? 

Seemed a little pricey $15 meals-They are huge though
For 3 women we barely ate half our meal so definitely we should have split 

3 meals with 5 drinks total (3 house wines & 2 beers) was $75 plus tip 
$90 total seemed stiff to me but I live in Gilbert with 3 little kids so maybe I am bad judge of eating out pricing ??? 

They should really give out free chips & salsa-If they start doing that then I would give them 4 starsCute place and good food, the green chile Mac was to die for. Would have definitely give this 4 stars but our service was just horrible. It was late night so it was empty, which would make it seem simple to serve us. But I got attitude on several occasions. When I asked about the free chips and salsa for checking in I got eyes rolled at me. And the same when I asked for to go boxes. I don't know maybe he was mad we weren't ordering alcohol? Either way the food was good and the hot sauce was bomb we took two bottles home with us. I would come back but hopefully get a better server!Had lunch yesterday here and experienced a bit of a hiccup but wanted to review to compliment the management. I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box, which comes with miso soup, rice, spring roll, a pork wonton, and a salad. I was kinda picking at the salad, and ended up finding a feather in it. Lord knows how it got there, but hey, random stuff happens. 
The waitress was visibly very grossed out, as she wouldn't even touch said feather with her hands. The manager came over, profusely apologized, and let me know that they had taken care of the meal. I hadn't expected that, just asked for a different salad from a new batch. I felt he dealt with the issue very professionally without making me feel like I had created a huge deal. 
We were too early for HH specials, but I have enjoyed them before. While this isn't my favorite sushi joint, I would go back for HH again despite my experience. I was overall impressed with how the manager dealt with what was obviously just an unfortunate mishap.Food was delicious! If you are unsure what "authentic" Mexican food is, double check with your server about he plate you are interested in before ordering. Great outdoor patio. Slow service. Great house margarita!I am totally listening to the 80's Wild Wild West song while writing this review and it is totally perfect.  Travis makes an mean drink and wears a handle bar mustache and derby bartender hat.  The have wine flights which is a big positive plus wine on tap which is interesting to try.  The place is a little strange b/c it is cowboy/ranchy but the food is very modern and VERY GOOD.  It is a weird vibe.  Service was good too.  Crowd a little strange.  I had a country style pate that was complex and tasty.  We started with a pasta dish on their menu as an appetizer and a pork cheek ravioli.  The pasta on the menu was much better.  My favorite part of the meal was dessert.  We tried three and all were tasty.  I would say these are some of the better desserts in Scottsdale. I would not take out-of-town guests here, but the chef is very meticulous so I would probably go for a quiet dinner with the husband.  I would probably give it a 3.5 overall.Pretty OK.  Visited several times.  
Been for lunch (roast beef really good).  
Bar scene is nice, rustic-type atmosphere.  Had office group & several plates of all the different appies to nosh on, was good.  
Martinis are 'ok', same goes for glasses of wine.  
Good for an after work sorta thing.This came highly recommended by locals, as well as friends who recently attended a conference at The Fairmont Resort near Charleston's.  I had the country fried steak and it was more quantity than quality.  I, for one, am worn out with seemingly every restaurant using "chipotle" in their dishes and this was the case with Charleston's country fried steak gravy, which has a little kick.  I had a cup of potato soup and it was excellent.

Friends with me had a cheeseburger and meat loaf.  My one friend raved about how delicious the meatloaf was and the other said his hamburger was perfectly cooked (hot pink in the middle).

I liked the dark wood atmosphere of the restaurant and it had customers ranging from families with kids to senior citizens, so it is clearly appealing to a mix of people.

Service was okay, though not memorable.Only cause time is money got an oil change and back brakes took over 3 hrs and you don't even get a complementary car. Also the service guy easily put 20 miles on my car what gives I also seen him driving it like it was stolen unsure if I will return. 1 last thing when you go in the know one who works here drives a Volvo mostly Honda's what's up with that.Not as good as I had hoped for. Not horrible, but I just moved over to this area from San Diego a week ago and was looking for a little mexican shop on par with everywhere in SD. Yes, I know I am not in SD anymore so I can't expect the same thing. If I were to have found this place there I would have rated it as a generous 2 stars.  But again overall I just had better expectations for a 4.0 rating with over 130 votes.The Salt Cellar has been a culinary landmark in the valley since I was just a kid, so I was aware of it's reputation.  I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however, if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience, you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.

The atmosphere is cool - in that, the dining area is located underground, making it dimly lit, and the theme is old nautical.  (Although, I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.

We ordered the Monk Fish, Crab Cakes, Baked-Stuffed Lobster, and the Salmon.  Everything was tasty and fresh, but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes.  Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.

I'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it, but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back.Food was great, beer is good and the service was good until the end when we asked to have the check split (between two couples - not something one would think is difficult.) Our waitress was visibly upset and snatched the receipt and stormed off. She came back with the split check (for which we thanked her), she huff'd and walked away. Not something that would cause me to tell people not to go, but be aware that check splitting may be frowned upon!I will only add to the many reviews saying that the service here is pretty terrible, but the food is pretty good.  But I will add that I went to the Pita Jungle location in Scottsdale and received better service.  Still not great, but better.

Their falafel plate is great, the honey pasta salad is good but easily made at home, and their hummus is reliable but again, I could make this at home and not be ignored by indifferent servers as I wait 20 minutes for my check.I'm sorry that I can't agree with others who have posted glowing reviews of this restaurant.  I simply wasn't that impressed.  This was my first time eating Ethopian food.  Seeing as Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world where people are starving, it seemed weird that they would have a cuisine to call their own in the first place.  I had the vegetarian platter, which came with several different kinds of items, all placed on top of a tasteless, spongy bread.  None of the items were bad.  Everything was decent.  It just wasn't great.  The spices they use are very similar to what you'd find in Indian food.  Maybe if they used the spices a little more liberally, the food wouldn't have been so bland.  

The ambiance in the restaurant was also of a slightly lower standard than I would have wanted.  It's not very fancy.  I was there on a date, and this wasn't exactly the type of place where I would go again on a date.  I think this is more of a restaurant where I'd bring my family to eat.  But if you require a place that inspires romance on some level, this isn't the place for you.  

For all the unflattering things I've said about this place, one of the best things about it is that everything is very reasonably priced.  It's not like they're giving you less than what you paid for.  The prices are commensurate with the quality of food and type of restaurant this is.  I would eat here again.  I was just hoping for better on my first dining experience.Chaos. That pretty much describes the experience when at Goldfland. Be prepared for a thousand kids running around the entire property, amped up on pixie stix and Coke. Not trying to sound old here - it's just the clientele that they attract.

The Go-Karts have to the best part here. Not as fast as the like of Octane Raceway, but plenty fun for a few laps. The Golf is average and even felt a bit short of a course because the 18th hole comes up so quickly. 

Laser tag was closed when I went, so I can't talk about that. But keep in mind that they probably close it more often.

The staff looked more fatigued than the parents. Their facial expressions said nothing less than "Please let me go home!" They were unenthusiastic, unwelcoming and pretty much uncaring. Conversely, the staff at Dave & Busters is much more accommodating and helpful if you ask them a question.

Anyhow, I liked Golfland, but I would have to be very committed to the constant stream of chaos if I'm going again. Good to go once, good for a casual date, but definitely not a regular visit.Oh weeee, my friend and I ordered and shared the chicken spicy masala and a mild lamb vindaloo. Our good came in a timely manner and the restaurant was barely packed. That didn't mean the food wasn't good! It was delicious. We were served a really good appetiZer that I can't recall the name but it was made of mint and/or cilantro. It was free and it was oh soooo yummy. After a couple of minutes we received our order with garlic naan and basmati rice. I preferred the masala over the vindaloo but that's probably because it may have been more fatty and buttery. 

I would come again. Thank you! For a good experience of Indian food in tempe. Yumm3/17/10

I know it's been awhile since I was last here, although not quite as long as sixteen months!  I see that the decor has changed yet again-- last time major add I knew of was the painted poetry on the wall next to the restroom.  There are now car door cutouts-as-art lining two walls near the front of the resto, along w/ a couch, or two.  Eclectic, and a nice add to the vibe that Green already exudes.  

Tried the crab puffs again (it's been awhile since I last had them).  Wished I didn't.  Don't know if it's the ingredients in the vegan cream cheese (it contains corn/derivatives), or the fact that they're deep-fried (not all fried items make me queasy after), or both, but I'm not going to order these again.  I should've just thrown them away, but the crunchiness of the wonton (have I mentioned that I love crunchy-munchy foods?) and the cost of this app, $4 (or $1 a pop), made me plow on.  Never again.

The original "g" spicy po-boy made me forget my disappointment, however, as I crunched through the scrumptious mock chicken and its lovely and indeed spicy buffalo sauce!  Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices, arugula, and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll, along w/ a side of thyme fries... Mmm... a must-try!

Seeing others enjoying their tsoynami sundaes made me want to get one myself, so after some deliberation, I decided on one of the daily specials- Death by Chocolate: vanilla soy ice cream w/ vegan brownie chunks, Newman's Own chocolate wafer crumbles, and vegan chocolate syrup.  Undeniably choco-licious, but something was amiss... I believe I was wishing for a colder sensation that regular ice cream offers and that soy ice cream cannot deliver.  It wasn't a warm day, and the tsoynami sundae that was delivered to me already had that sheen that regular ice cream develops when it's allowed to sit around and melt.  Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me, but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria, instead.  Which, as a non-vegan, I will.  Next time.  

While the app and dessert left me wishing I didn't indulge, the "g" spicy po-boy indubitably made my tastebuds sing.  I'll just have to stick w/ the artichoke gratine and say sayonara to tsoynami in the future.  Don't the photos look divine, though?I came with a friend because I've driven by a couple of times and it looks like a cute place.  It's got a quaint "authentic Italian" look to it--the owners actually hail from Sicily.  The food is pretty good, too.  Nothing to write home about, but good, decent Italian.  The one exception?  The calamari.  Fantastic.  Worth the somewhat high price (although you do get pretty large portions).

Here's the problem I have with this place, though: it tries too hard.  The waiters look like they just rented their tuxes from Al's Formal Wear.  The music playing in the background was what you would expect to play in the background of an Italian Restaurant in a bad movie.  Think "That's Amore" and "Mambo Italiano."  Is there some kind of XM radio station that only plays music for Italian Restaurants?  If I worked here I'd want to slit my wrists after listening to that stuff for a couple of days.

But again, decent food.  If you like the kitsch, the atmosphere is good too.  And there's a cute little patio with a great view of the bodega across the street.I LOVE Mr. Hunans, he delivers quickly and efficiently and the pricing is not too bad.  There are some website issues but i just call in the order and they are very responsive.  The drivers were nice but they had trouble finding my suite.  As far as quality goes its good and enough so to make it my consistent Chinese food spot.Has anyone seen the Undercover Bosses- Rally episode
It's a good one
I enjoy chowing at Rally's from time to time. It always seems like such a different experience compared to today's big corporations like Mcdonald's and BK
This is the only Rally's location I know of in Phoenix but I am pretty sure there are a couple more

The food is good here
The Burgers are nice and a good size
The fries have a nice texture
The milkshakes and sundaes are wonderful

The customer service is superb as well

If you haven't been to Rally's 
You're missing outI'm not going to lie, I was extremely nervous to go here, BUT it was actually okay.  
The service was kind of slow and the chick wasn't very attentive AND then the sushi chef went outside on a smoke break....  
Needless to say, I probably will not go out of my way to revisit, but whilst there it was fair....Want to get drunk? I mean falling over, possibly having sex in public...but you're not sure if that really happened drunk?

This is the place.

Described aptly as "7-11 on acid" the giant bank of alcoholic slurpee, er daiquiri, machines is a sight to behold! Try to catch a glimpse of the inner workings while waiting for the men's room (its fine to go into the locking one ladies) its kind of crazy in there! All sorts of whirring machines and people leaping around with gallon buckets of daiquiri mixes, or stirring 50 gallon vats of daiquiri mix that recently had an obscene amount of liquor dumped into it.

Wait a minute! They don't only have daiquiri drinks! They've got a full bar! They've got food too? WTF? Fats actually has a pretty good kitchen. If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar. The servers really aren't interested...honestly this is probably one of the worst places in the world to be a server. Go to the bartenders, they are happy.

Remember though, the whole point of this place is to get you drunk. They know their job well. They have levers to pull on a bank of machines that makes drunks, they hand you a glass of something that is generally over 150 proof (75% ABV). The most famous drink is the 190 Octane, it really is 190 proof (95% ABV) then you can get everclear soaked cherries as well...

I have never left this place sober.Barely 3 stars.

This is my 2nd try to this place. The first wasn't that great, so I took my time to come back and I'm disappointed again :(

We sat outside. What a bad idea. The table was next to untrimmed plants and flies were flying around during all the dinner.

I was craving pork belly and when I ordered, the waiter said that that was the only dish they didn't have. Great. I ordered cheese plate (which was the best of the night), baked potato soup (lame), fillet (with too much sauce and peppers, plus the spinach had no taste) and a side of caramelized onion risotto (which was a little more than ok).

In general good location, nice setting but just lame overpriced food.

Not sure if I'll be back.3 stars by the skin of their teeth.  Was there last Friday night and things were hopping...with the customers, that is, but service was painfully slow, both at the bar where we had drinks and appetizers and for dinner.  When we eventually did get our entrees the people at the table next to us  leaned over and said "i'll give you $30 for that - we've been waiting an hour!"   We had too, so we understood their desperation.  It was a wait to order, a wait for our food, a wait for the check, a wait for the receipt...ugh.  Now keep in mind that I love leisurely dining and hate being rushed.  So if service, especially at dinner, is slow by my definition, it is truly glacially paced.

So on to the food.  The bruschetta - simple and wonderful due to the fresh and flavorful small tomatoes.  The bread and dip trio (hummus, oil, pesto) is also pleasing.  I ordered the fish of the day, an atlantic sole in buerre blanc.  The fish was fantastic  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and with a perfect texture.  The buerre blanc was a useless bland sauce that did nothing but detract from the fish.  The salad greens in aioli dressing were a miss.  The weirdly bitter aioli drenched the greens, making them a soggy mass.  The table consensus was "interesting.  Not good"

My husband's fried chicken was oddly and unpleasingly  bland, and tasted devoid of seasoning or salt.  I only ate the coating because I am allergic to chicken, but isn't that supposed to be the best part?  The husband confirmed the meat was similarly bland.  My sister in law loved her annolotti.  We would have liked to try dessert but we'd been there so long by the time we were afraid we'd become permanently attached to the chair and decided to escape while possible.the food here is good for the price but just ok when you consider other thai places in the area like thai elephant.  Its an ASU favorite and their Curries are the way 2 go.  I recommend at least trying this place and forming your own opinion.Inexpensive and popular place, gets quite crowded at lunch.  We tried the Peanut Curry (Panang) with chicken, and the red curry with beef.  Service is good, and friendly.  Lunch specials come with a small egg roll, that is quite good, rice, and a light cup of soup.
Their scheme of spiciness is quite accurate in my opinion.  The Panang chicken was quite good, with more vegetables than I am accustomed to.  The red curry was tasty, but the beef was pretty chewy.  Guess I'm spoiled by the Thai in Los Angeles.After reading all the reviews and since I live close by, I decided to give Classic Italian Pizza a try.  When I arrived at around 6pm, I was the first person in the restaurant.  My first impression was -why is it so dark in here? My second impression was-why are they so expensive?  

With the exception of the Margherita, White Pizza, and two or three other pizzas, the majority of the pizzas were in the $15.00 to $17.75 range.  While I was going to get the Capriciossa pizza, it was the most expensive pizza on their menu and I was put off at the price. As others have noted, these pizzas can be shared but at 12 inches in diameter, they are primarily for one person. 

Contrary to what some other reviewer wrote, these pizzas do not come with complimentary bread.  The bread was listed under appetizers and if I recall correctly, it was listed at $7.00, which I think is absolutely ridiculous.  On their menu, they also had some salads and they only had 1 desert item-tiramisu-also at the very high price of $7.00.

As for the pizza itself, the Margherita pizza I had certainly was good.  The cheese was excellent, the sauce good and crust pretty good  as well although I think it could have been done just a bit more. Needless to say, while I liked the pizza, I did not find it incredibly fantastic.

At the end of the day, the pizza, while good, was just too pricey.  If you look at other notable pizza restaurants in Phoenix- Humble Pie, La Grande Orange, Cibo, and even Pizzeria Bianco, all of the prices for pizza at these restaurants are less money.  While $17.75 for a pizza might be considered acceptable in San Francisco or New York, I've been around and for Phoenix, this place is overpriced .Salsa was fantastic!  I had the chicken tacos....the chicken was very salty...they were okay.This place is decently priced compared to some of the other apartments around here, with out the ghetto feel. There are a lot of student who on occasion get loud and rowdy but that just depends on who you have as your neighbor. The kids that moved in upstairs last month for example enjoy partying and have puke over the railing twice and have not cleaned it up. So there it sits there still both piles continuously baking outside of my apartment door. You would think the grounds keepers would have cleaned it up but I guess its not a high priority. My only other complaint would be that I have lived here a year now and I had trouble with gold gym and had to change my bank info. I have never been even remotely late and have even paid months ahead. I mistakenly paid rent that same week with a check and went to tell the management about my mistake she told me I would never be able to pay with checks again and after almost begging at her own grace the manager told me she would not charge me late fees. 
Bottom line is if you can find a house its a better value for your money in this area. You can buy a house cheaper then you can rent an apartment here. If you must settle on an apartment I would still choose this one because its small and on occasion they do drawings and bbqs and things and they are the worst priced out there. Perfect middle of the road apartments.We sat out on the patio on a Saturday morning and it was so peaceful. I had the Atkins carb friendly breakfast so I'm gluten free. The turkey sausage was tasty but extra greasy. Pretty decent. My husband got bacon and eggs. Personally I thought his bacon was amazing because it wasn't burnt and it wasn't dripping. For a breakfast spot it wasn't too shabby and I probably would come here again.We usually road trip to San Diego several times a year and have always talked about stopping at Space Diner and today we finally did.  The employees were friendly, bathrooms very clean and the food was good!  We would stop again!its an ok place to go it is close to home.When it comes to pedicures, I'm no expert but I would give them top scores. They are super friendly, did a great job and feet looked fantastic. I don't understand why it adds $5 to work on your calluses but ok. It seemed like there was a lot of add-on pricing and they definitely pushed additional services but then again, it is a business.

For the manicure, I was super happy when I first got it and they seem to use top quality materials but my nails started lifting around the cuticles within a week. It was my first time getting nails in 10 years so I thought maybe it was me. They told me to wash my hands less and it took about 2 weeks to start lifting the second time. Maybe it is worth it to pay a little more elsewhere?Since the community grew quicker than the Diocese could keep up, SJN is still physically building the church.  With 2 weekly collections, the goal of SJN's campaign is closer each year.  The guidelines of SJN is located in the inside cover of the hard cover missal.  Since kneelers are not available, you stand throughout the liturgy of the Eucharist, unless you are physically unable just like some other neighborhood Catholic churches in Vegas.  The best part so far is the new children's choir during the 12 noon mass.  Another positive factor is the 5pm mass with usually less people and more parking available.I love Applebee's.  I use to take all the chicks to Applebee's for a NICE date. Now they take me here haha. Ignore me. The meds are kicking in.

Never come here for lunch. I've always heard about how bad it gets.  It gets crazy busy and yet they do not know how to handle it. Last time I was here with some of the guys from work, maybe 6 of us. Once again someone didn't get their food until the almost very end.  This time it was me. boo. it seems like almost every other time someone in our group gets screwed. SMH

But yet I still love Applebee's because for those who aren't adventurous with their food, as I am, they're usually satisfied with Applebee's.Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  

Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. 

As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. 

Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.

Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2ur8pXFTFraCZnKwSEV4BA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Lovely Pair:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QHGjqvOeYqQEo01Gr6KlqQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQEasy airport to maneuver through and love that you can continue to gamble while you wait for your flight.  I noticed the flight agents at Southwest are pretty used to people getting on their flight late, due to not being able to pull away from the slot machines.  Believe me I've been there...good thing you aren't the only one trying to cash out quickly and run to the plane, otherwise it would be embarrassing.  :)3 stars. What more am I supposed to say aside from the fact that I love how they have slot machines inside... haha

Sin City baby!Fly in and out of Vegas here every time. Not that exciting of an airport, but it doesn't really need to be when you have one of the most exciting cities right outside your doors. 

The cab rides are super expensive, so that sucks.I love that they have slots right next to the gates....for the people who can't wait to get to the strip when they land, and the people who are trying to break even before they go home.  I've been lucky lately to not have to take the tram for anything.  Not a fan of the tram. Not sure why.  I'm not weird.A solid airport. Their security line moved quickly. The TSA people were very friendly and not demeaning when they tell you to "take your shoes and belt off!! do not be THAT person!" 

YIKES.. alright I won't be THAT person.. 

Looks like they were making some renovations when I was there last, so that should be nice. They have some nice dining options.. bathrooms were also placed throughout and they were clean.I don't hate this airport as much as LAX, but it's pretty confusing.  There's like 50 lines for southwest organized in no order what so ever.  Your rental shuttle takes you to one area, then you need to take another shuttle to your terminal.  Then find really confusing long lines for southwest indoors and outdoors! 

I had mixed bag with employees, 1 was really rude and mean, 2 were really nice.  

Tip - I think the outdoor lines are shorterThis airport was pretty empty when we got here on Saturday morning, kind of creepy but kind of cool so we wouldn't have to deal with crazy crowds. I found it interesting that they had slot machines by the baggage claim. I didn't see much of the stores around the terminal because I was ready to get picked up and get my drink on. But going outside to find the pick up spot was very confusing. Why so confusing! Ugh. Both my ride and us were confused on where we should get picked up. We eventually got picked up at T3, in a parking structure, 3 levels up... so weird. Anyways once we got picked up we went on our way to have some fun in the city of sin...The portion size is the same as the restaurant itself small. But the was okMy favorite lunch spot downtown. The place aint pretty but the food is good.usually when i head downtown i always start off my night here, Cheap drinks,  the bartenders are pretty generous, the staff are always pretty cool, 5 dollar gambling, the cafe inside serves up nice size portions, they upgraded the joint a few years ago so it is not as sketchy.  If you are downtown want to do it cheap check out the Gold Spike~I had only gone to Downtown Las Vegas once before which was a gaudy experience, so I am happy this time around it was different. New Years Day, 2am, finding my way to the jail to wait outside until 4am hoping my boys would get released. It was freezing, people everywhere, and just waiting. Happy friggin New Years.

This time around it was nice and warm, I went for my friend's wedding, and we stayed at the Fremont.

Have you been wanting to go to the Phillipines? 
Do you enjoy cheesy-ness?
Have you been craving some Dunkin Donuts?

Well you have found the right place! Come on down to Fremont. It was really cute. Walking around the casino, seeing all the Filipino lolas gambling and complaining in Tagalog to their hubbys. Reminded me of my BFF's family parties.

I don't ever recall going to DD's so that was cool to try it. 

We finally get to the hotel at like 1 or 2am, we pull up and it's valet only. It was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because we didn't have to drive round and round, park, and lug our luggage 5 miles like on the Strip. Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.
We walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.

The room was okay. Not too bad, not too great, just meh. Right when I walk in my mama goes "there's a red dot on the ground and I don't know what it is!" LOL... Ummm okay? We just avoided it. Whatever. It looked like Cool Aid. 
The sink was tiny. Dude. What the F. Like seriously. 

We just got ready and slept so it wasn't a big deal at all. I've stayed everywhere. Doesn't matter to me.

One thing I liked is that it's a short walk downstairs, to the room, to the car, to the Fremont Street Experience, and just to about everywhere. One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?I'm torn to give this place 3 stars. 

Good:
- REALLY nice service at the front desk. From the moment we checked in everyone was really nice, helpful and gave us advice to skip the tourist things. 
- decent location. I mean it's downtown. As many times as I've been to Vegas I've ever been downtown so the crowd was different but ok, more....homely?

Ok:
- It's an older hotel so the rooms are nothing close to the strip, but again, for the price you can't really get upset about it. 

Nothing to really complain about I guess other than the amenities. No pool which is kind of a bummer. Good thing I was only there for the weekend with family so we didn't stay in the room a lot.

If I had a choice and was paying, I wouldn't stay here.My review is for the casino only.  El Cortez is in a shady area of downtown.  It's nothing fancy and the clientele can be a bit sketchy.  It's pretty small - not a lot of tables or variety of slots.  But they offer free play like no other casinos!  They sent me a $100 gaming credit in the mail to get me in the door, then during my birthday month, sent me $50 more dollars in free play.  Their slots are pretty loose and let you play/win for awhile.  With the right incentives, it's a decent place to play.  :)Have never stayed the night in this hotel.  I have played the slots here a few time and like some of the other hotels around Freemont this one also could benefit from a good face lift.We stayed at the Golden Nugget in May of 2009.  We were getting married and excited.  The staff at the front desk was mattter of fact at best.  We were hoping for a possible upgrade as this was going to be our honeymoon, no such luck.  We never had another interaction with the staff, not one member of the staff went out of their way for anything.

The casino was nice and so was the pool, the cafe sucks and the gift shop had some really nice clothes.  The staff at the gift shop was friendly and attentive .

All in all I expected a little more personality from a hotel that at one time was top-notch.Good location. Clean store. Manager is very pushy with deals and sales info when I first walk in store. Let me come in and browse a second before you pounce.This is an odd Subway, gas station combo.  The two businesses run separately, which makes it confusing when you want to make purchases from both.  
The staff at the Subway counter is probably the friendliest and most attentive I've seen in any Subway (I'm a weekly customer to locations all over the country).  Food was spot on and as fresh as is expected from this brand.
I only wish that you could purchase convince store items with my Subway purchase.Walmart is Walmart, it's just the same as the others I've visited. So I'm not sure how I can rate this. I can say that I can get just about anything here from toys, electronics, clothing and now even produce. Weird to see it here but they do have e'm here now. This place is competition with Target IMO. But heck whatever is more closer and convenient, I'll go to, but you can get just about anything at Target than you can at Walmart.

Thank goodness for Walmart I can get my toilet paper at a cheap price. Bleh.Just got back from frozen fury. (F the av's).. Anywho, we stayed at the Rio all suites. The rooms are very spacious. It had a fridge and and other helpful hotel stuff. We had a view of the pool and the strip which was nice. The casino part is pretty small compared to all the major resorts out there. The pool area was big. They had sand beach's and little grotto's all around. They also have a topless pool however all I saw entering was old men :(  
  The cons would be we had a room that joined the one next to us. The door in between wasn't quite flush to the ground so it sounded like our neighbors were in our room! It didn't help that they were butt holes either. Also if you wanted coffee in your room you had to buy it from the vending machines. And if you have a room facing the pool in between 10am & 6pm They play bass thumping party music that we could hear all the way up on the 26th floor. If you have the inevitable Vegas hangover you will want to have a sniper riffle and pick off the DJ. 
  Besides that I'd recommend the Rio all suites. They always have deals on rooms. They have free shuttles to the strip. It's walking distance to the Palms. All the restaurants were pretty good. The roof top bar "Voodoo" has AMAZING views! And Penn & Teller perform there.Decent place, good margarita's and good service.  I would definitely go back.This place is better than the average run of the mill sushi buffet place, but why not save your pennies for a they-make-it-as-you go sushi joint?  The only great thing about this sushi place is that there is a lot of variety.  The fish doesn't taste bad, but quality is just not as great as it could be.

This location, specifically, could be cleaner.  But the wait staff is very good; it's almost like the drinks are refilling themselves automatically.Amazing view, good services, good food.This review is from a visit on 9/2013. We had the tasting menu and I cant remember much but the foie gras which is amazing. View is fabulous and service was great.This store seems a bit older, not near as nice as my regular Target (N 5th in NLV) but it works. The bathroom wasn't very clean and had a funky odor. Otherwise it was your standard Target and the only reason I went here is because I was at the Blick Art store across the parking lot.Best biscuits in the world. Can actually feel my heart slow down from all the fat. The rest of the food is just ok but the biscuits and coconut shrimp make me come back for more.Nice mall. Clean, cool shops, good choices in the food court. You know what would have been really helpful? A directory. Yeah. Directory would be good.The polo towers is a great place to sleep...and only sleep. I was staying in the studio bedroom, and it was clean, had a kitchenette and a view of the strip. The location of the hotel is nice, about a 15 minute walk from the Excalibur which has a tram to some of the other hotels. Housekeeping forgot to replace our towels, so I called and they were there in15 minutes and even called after to make sure that it was done. Not much to do at the actual hotel but I didn't mind. Perfectly good place to stay as long as you dont mind having to walk a lot.Let's say...you're on a budget, need a big room with two spacious beds, and love to roam the strip on foot: Excalibur is the best hotel for you. 

Price ($29 off season special to about $150 suites) is what set's Excalibur above the other nearby hotels. I have stayed here about 5 times before moving to Las Vegas and my overall feeling is MEH!!!

It's not bad at all, the motif of an adult disney land is old...but awesome. Regular rooms come with two queen beds and a flat screen TV. Suites are moderate in size as compared to the Paris' Red Room and Planet Hollywood Suites. The furnishings and styles inside are EXTREMELY dated but for the price....acceptable.

Entertainment options plentiful: Fantasy, Tournament of Kings, and that dude one (disclaimer: as a straight male, one shall not acknowledge the existence of said "banana fest" show). Also, Excalibur is at the bottom of the strip, perfect for early morning joggers, walkers, and excercise enthusiasts.

I totally recommend this place to all my cash strapped friends visiting from Hawaii. The adage goes, "you get what you pay for."I walked out and was awed. We're going to be staying at a castle?! Now I get to be the princess I always knew I was... and on my birthday!

I would have given them another star, but I think the person who cleaned our room threw away my Starbucks cup. It was the hard plastic kind that was insulated and not just some regular cup. What am I going to bring onto the strip now?!

We went the first weekend of January and the prices were outrageously...CHEAP! $70 for a whole weekend with 2 queen size beds?? How can you complain about that?! Overall the room was decent considering we just slept in it for the most part. My only complaint was that the air conditioner was super loud (for the day) and the blanket was too thin (for the night). Otherwise, this hotel is a little older than most and not the greatest ambiance wise, but if you were just going to sleep in it, it's very doable. It's at the end of the strip but most places are very walkable!My second time in Vegas; first time on the strip. Decided to stay here because we got a pretty good deal.

Positives:
-$20 food & beverage credit.
-Express monorail that ran between Excaliber, Mandalay Bay and the Luxor.
-Room was clean; Bed was comfortable.
-Staff was friendly and accommodating.
-Got free room upgrade.
-Food court and buffet available.
-Walkway to the Luxor.
-Safe in room.

Negatives:
-Casino and walk ways felt crowded at times.
-Hotel lobby and casino looks worn.
-Stayed on smoking floor. Smelled like weed quite a bit.
-Far end of strip. Have to walk or take taxi to other casinos.
-Food prices high.
-Absolutely no water pressure in shower.
-Time share people are highly annoying.

If you're wanting to stay on the strip but still stay within a budget, this may be the way to go. I would stay here again if the price is right. This isn't one of the high end hotels on the strip, but it's got all the essentials and will put you close to everything.Today was the first day that I had been able to go back to Firefly in over 2 and a half years. It would have been five stars easily, if it was based off of my prior experiences, but not so much anymore. Three stars seems too low for a place that use that used to hold a special place in my heart and stomach, so four stars seems about right.

The savory tapas are still delicious.

The standout dishes are:
Tortilla espanola- A potato omelet dish garnished with sriracha sauce and  parsley.
Crispy duck rolls- Fried duck egg roll served with a hoisin dressing.
Camarones a la diabla- A spicy and sweet shrimp dish. Get some extra bread and mop up the sauce.
Shrimp ceviche-  Large chunks of shrimp, avocado, diced onions and bell pepper tossed in lime juice and served with tortilla strips.
Stuffed dates- Dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon, fried crispy, garnished with goat cheese and parsley. 

If it was not 12:30pm... who am I kidding, if I wasn't driving, I would have been drinking. Remember kids, don't drink and drive. Make someone else be the DD. Their red and white sangrias are delicious. The best part of the drunken state comes from eating the fermented fruit floating around. After a few, it becomes a game to catch them all. Firefly's mojitos are amazing as well. My personal favorite are the mango or blood orange.  Even though it is a rum drink, that uses simple syrup, the fruit juices don't make it overbearingly sweet.

The real disappointment lies in the desserts. I use to love this place for their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate tres leches cake, but the former was lacking immensely today. For one, there was hardly any banana in the sandwiches and they were cooked so dry that I needed to ladle the nutella onto it. Don't get me wrong, I would drink nutella, but I want to have the choice to go without it and that was taken away from me. The tres leches cake was delicious, but did it get smaller? Since coming back to Vegas, this has been the first time I looked at a dish and said, "WTF, where is my food?".

I should have gone with my first instinct and gone to the Lunch Box for their waffle ice cream sandwich.Dinner here at the cafe was fine, but I left feeling slightly underwhelmed.

The appetizers were the best part (which seemed to be the theme of our weekend in Vegas!)--we ordered the pork potstickers, the burrata with prosciutto, and sliders. Everything was timely and on point.

For the main courses, I thought the shortribs were the winner at our table.  My rigatoni was oversalted and I thought the pasta/sauce portion was a little off. I also had a bite of the salmon pizza and really loved it for a bite, although I don't know if I'd necessarily want a whole pizza of salmon!

Service was great.The food was delicious!  I enjoyed the prosciutto and burrata.  The steak frites is a splurge, but worth it!  One of the best steaks I've ever eaten.  The lunch staff service needs improvement.  I came right when it opened.  I dined alone, and the hostess was annoyed when I chose a table over sitting at the bar.  The man that filled my water and took my dishes was the friendliest worker I encountered.The gelato and coconut sorbet were very good. The service was just OK.. they didn't pay you much attention just handed what you wanted and told you the price.  

The location is the best part of this place - you can get your gelato and sit in the promenade and catch one of the carnevale performances.Good for locals wanting to just get a way and be a part of the touristy crowd. When I u se to live in Vegas my fiance and I would always make a room reservation once a month just to get away from a daily boring lives living in las vegas.

What we Like:

Adventurdome: only $26
Midway : We can act like kids we love playing the games. This place seems so much BIGGER when I was little, so weird how small it got through adult eyes.
We got a room at the SKYRISE TOWER 22705 .. King bed, I think this is the upgraded ones because last one we stayed at was VERY OLD AND SMELLY LOOKING.
Cheapest rate on the Strip typically $26.00 a night

What we did not like:

We just had a room here 7/28 - they now have a RESORT FEE?????
$10.95???? Why what is the whole purpose???

ALL THE FOOD IN THIS HOTEL WAS NASTY!!!! 
Do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks down to Mcdonald's or any other restaurant on the strip. You have way too many choices to waste your money here.

We had a coupon here a 2 for 1 buffet - not even worth the half price! I got food poisoning!!!

This place just smelled OLD

They can upgrade the tvs.

Your lungs fill with smoke throughout your whole stay.Well I missed the $10 burger and a beer promo they have going on, but I didn't need that for lunch anyhow.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.
whoohoo

When we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4.To my chagrin I went here for my wedding dinner. Ack!!!

Listen to the folks who say this doesn't hold a candle to real Italian food. This is, indeed, cafeteria food. Way overpriced cafeteria food. I wouldn't be so critical but the price warrants any and all criticism. Really, only a cheap or lazy establishment should post menus on walls.

The free wine is garbage... Though some folks (the folks drinking to get drunk) may not mind. If you buy your vino in a box disregard that last statement.

The only memorable thing was the mocha coffee dessert. It was good, but short lived.

They had a hack accordian player wandering the room for tips too. He was unabashedly terrible. My father, who lived in Naples for a few years, tipped him to play a song that the guy promised he knew how to play. The guy messed around for a minute but did NOT play the right song and DID take dads five bucks first. What a tool!

Leaving here we tried to call for a few cabs. One cab showed and one limo, who was stalking the parking lot. The limo disclosed, after taking us for a two minute ride around the corner, that it cost $40!!!!! This was not the restaurants fault, but had they listened when we asked them to call TWO cabs we would have saved $30.

RUUUNNNNN!!!We've been coming here for years.  The last time in 2009.  So here we are, January 28, 2013 and decided to try our old haunt.  It hasn't changed a bit.  Busy as ever and the accordion player is still there - though his sets are much shorter!  The food is so-so but there is lots of it.  My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and I had the lasagna.  Huge portions for two people but we managed.  The free wine isn't as good as I remembered - but I had a less discriminating palette back then.  Who's to complain?  It comes with the meal!The food was good but I would like more for the price I paid. Service was not that greatVegas, baby! I haven't been for a few years now and when my friend and I decided to book our stay we knew that we had to go with the Wynn. I had heard great things and was so excited at the thought of staying that I almost peed myself....which is why I'm left feeling a little disappointed with the end result. There were things that I loved about my stay here but to be honest, I was left a little disappointed on some levels. 

Things that impressed me: 

- The pool: it's huge, beautiful, new and has plenty of lounging spots. They offer pool side service but beware, if you're hoping for a speedy turn over you may want to adjust your expectations or risk severe frustration. 

- The room: Beautiful, modern with cool art, a huge flat screen tv and a small tv in the bathroom that you can watch while getting ready. The beds were out of this world comfy; there were times when I didn't want to get out of bed. The view (at least from the 37th floor) was awesome. 

-Gambling: I won about $200 on penny slots. Ha! 

-Clubs: Had such a blast at Tryst and XS; they are the hottest clubs in Vegas right now and you'd be a fool not to check them out. Thanks, Mac, for hooking us up! :) 

- The fantastic deal we found on Travelocity: $396 (each - 2 people) for 4 nights and airfare. That is just an unbelievable price. 

Things that did NOT impress me: 

- The jenky-ass room they first tried to put us in. It was on the 6th floor and overlooking the top of another building. We went up, took one look and said hell no and demanded another room. 

- There was just not enough places to eat inside the hotel. They had only ONE cheap option which was this little cafe that offered crap. The only other two options were the buffet for $30 a pop and the Terrace Grill which was sit down. 

- Along those lines, since the Wynn is so new, It didn't feel developed enough for me (e.g. no shopping, not enough food options, etc.) We had to go to Cesar's and The Venetian to really get some good diversity. 

- It's at the end of the strip so you're not central; I didn't mind this so much but it's definitely something to think about when you're considering a place to stay. Expect lots of walking or lots of $$ spent on cabs. 

- The last thing, which probably made me the most irritated out of everything, was that there was NO COFFEE MAKER in the room!!! What. The. F*CK. What kind of hotel room as nice as that one doesn't offer some free coffee. I physically had to call the front desk and ask if I was missing something. Devastatingly, they confirmed my suspicions and directed me to in-room dining. After all was said and done, we were billed $18 for 2 small cups of coffee. 

As you can see, my review is conflicted. I wouldn't deter somebody from coming here but I would make sure to point out all the negatives that I stated above. 

Now, time to get back to nursing my liver back to health.Good food, Great price. Downside long wait on weekends, Smells like smoke everywhere, bathrooms are across the casino floor, service is OK at best, and employees aren't amiable, openly curse in English and Spanish in the dining room. But,  I love the steak and egg special, and the corn beef hash reminds me of how my mom would make corn beef, spam, egg and rice for breakfast.Actually had a good time at this hotel.  The bed in the smoking room wasn't very comfortable though and we got booked into that room and we don't smoke.  But they switched us to a non smoking room and it much more comfortable in that room.  The bathroom was also smaller in the non-smoking room and they had one of those radiated widow heaters instead of controlled temperature like in the smoking room, but it worked pretty good.  Suggest getting a room with a view though as all we saw were pipes and the top of a roof.  The food from the sports bar was reasonably priced though and the staff was, for the most part courteous.Now they have an open bar outside with waiting service. Big change with last year, changes inside too with the seating. Good thing is it's 24/7. I remember it tasted better years ago. Now it's just like any other place. First time eating since 2008.Maybe because I've been to MM World in NY that I find this location unimpressive.  The MM statues are 1/2 the size of the ones in NY, and they have a rope around them, no cool photo op here.

We were in and out, went to all floors, in about 5 minutes.  It's cool that you can get exclusive color mms but be prepared to pay extra.  Everything else was also overpriced, as expected.UPDATE!!! DUE TO A SYSTEM / COMPUTER MALFUNCTION M&M'S WORLD HAS CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD A SECOND TIME!! I WAS THERE ON 5/27/11 AND WAS JUST RE-BILLED $120 BUCKS YESTERDAY 7/11/11!!! WTF??!!! 

I called to talk to a manager but one would not get on the phone. The receptionist put me on hold a couple times, obviously confirming with someone else in her office. She came back to the phone advising me of the system failure 5/27/11 - 5/29/11 many credit card and debit card charges have been billed again in JULY!! The M & M Corporate office is aware of the issue and claims to be working to resolve it... 

HMPH..Roadtrippin' to Vegas
But got there so late.
Please no long lines
For this we would hate.

0400, what's poppin'?
Someone shouted "Drai's!"
Found a shitload of people
Outside forming a maze.

All hope was lost
As we stood there dead last.
When an guy with a ticket
Scooted us past.

For a group of just girls
Vegas don't suck.
One dude in your crew
And you're shit out of luck.

:)I've never had the "pleasure" of staying at Casino Royale, so this review is solely for the casino, bars, and food offerings.

First and foremost there is nothing Royale about Casino Royale. This is as bare bones as you get for anything on the strip. Even O'Shea's is a step up from this joint.
But...Casino Royale can churn out the cheap drinks better than any other place on the strip. They have that convenient service bar on the side of the bar as you pass through, where surprisingly friendly bartenders expedite the $1 frozen margaritas (8 oz.) and Michelob bottles with rarely more than a few minutes wait even with a line.
(Keep in Mind it is a CASH bar only though.)

Bill's tops the same 8 oz rita with a float, and its a better overall deal, but I'm a bottle beer guy, and prefer the dollar beers at the Royale to the dollar drafts at other places, especially on busy nights if you are walking the strip, no place gets you in and out like Casino Royale.

The food court is simple, but good, with cheap hot dogs, ice cream, and other snacks. Although If I'm grabbing something on the go or a quick fast food bite I'm usually going to O'Shea's.

The gaming is good and I've yet to run into a surly dealer there, which is great when you are only playing to kill time or goof around. They understand the clientele and play to their preferences. Mostly $5 tables and penny slots.

***They do get a bonus though for having the cheapest ATM fee on the strip. (Although I haven't been in quite some time) It used to be .99c but I have heard they raised it to $1.99.

Not the best Dive on the strip but for a Grab N Go scenario it beats everything including the 7-11.I thought this was the 'City that Never Sleeps.'  Crap!  I guess that is actually New York, but what gives?  It's 12:30am and I want some damn dinner! This is the only place at the Mirage that we could find that was still slinging it.  In fact, I think it's only open from 11pm to 6am, and their service here knows they are the only game in town, well, in this casino anyway, so they don't particularly care that they're rather slow.  

Anyway, this is Vegas, and I am keeping some random hours, so I end up eating here twice.  Both times I had the strawberry Belgian waffles.  What can I say; it was pretty good and decently priced.  Their coffee was good too; kept me going anyway :)Italian food located inside the MIrage. Niiiice.
There were a ton of restaurants to choose from in the Mirage but we settled for expensive expensive Italian food. 

The front area of Onda consisted of a little wine lounge. Just a place to relax and do some wine tasting. The actual restaurant is in the back of this place. The bread they gave us was typical, but the dipping sauce they provided was amazing! It was a mixture of olive oil, vinagarette, diced tomatoes, and roasted garlic cloves. Mmm!!

Here's what we ordered

CALAMARI
I wouldn't recommend it. The calamari was lightly fried but it didn't have the crunch I like with calamari. The calamari was indeed soft and fresh though.

LASAGNA
HUGE hunk of lasagna but priced at $26? I guess I won't order this again. I could barely finish this but the veal and pork that it was stuffed with was delicious.

OSSO BUCCO
A huge huge shank served on top of cheesey risotto rice. Yum! They even give you a fork to dig out the bone marrow in this veal shank. Ewwww! 

All in all, I enjoyed our dinner. We opted out on wine because we were too tired already so for the calamari, lasagna, and osso bucco, it came up to about $75 total. Not bad for a fine dining restaurant like this in Vegas, but will I come back? Probably not. It's a one time deal place.This was the first PF Chang's I had ever been to way back in 96/97/98 I can't recall but this was the original in Vegas before the one on the blvd opened.  

Eating at P.F. Chang's is like taking an introductory class in Chinese food.  For those that don't know authentic Chinese or asian food, this place is a great start for new palates.  It doesn't try to be authentic so you shouldn't go in assuming to have true home cooked meals here.  

The focus for them is clean "up-scale" atmosphere and consistent dishes across all their restaurants so that people from the mid-west  (or where ever people live that have never tried Asian cuisine) can feel comfortable and get a great meal.   Then when a restaurant pops up in Cheyenne WY or Troy, Mich., you have instant success (just an example)... I've been to other PF's and this one still surpasses others in flavor, but for those of you that know authentic food, this still doesn't stack up.  

I give it three for those that are looking to dabble in new things Chinese and get a familiarity to some of the tastes and styles, then once their "feet are wet" start getting adventurous... in no time you'll be asking for sea cucumber and birds nest soup (well maybe not that adventurous ;)I don't think Wolfgang Puck has every did me wrong. He knows how to run a great restaurant even though he isn't there and this place is no exception. I had the gnocchi and also ordered the blue cheese with truffle potato chips to start and it was so salivatingly good. I'm beginning to think Vegas is the new best culinary showcase city.Nice decor and very clean. The servers need to take some training on etiquette, but they didn't mean bad. The chicken tikka masala was tasty for sure but a small portion for the money. Goat biryami was bad . Gulab jun was yummy.I haven't been to Todai's in about two years and after my return to this location on a recent trip, I really was left unimpressed. The sushi is better than the sushi buffets I had locally but if you really want to get your moneys worth, go some place else like at the Bellagio or Alladin buffets. Unless you are strictly only sushi then this place would be satisfying at least. They lack a wide selection of seafood items and they are claiming to have a good variety of it? The crab legs were small and all snapped up by the patrons in less than five minutes. Sushi was unimpressive with a lot of rice for one sushi roll. It was not as fresh and until the tray was completely empty, only then would they refill it with fresh sushi. The desserts are the only highlight for me with custom crepes, green tea cheesecake slices, and mango yogurt. I would only come here again if the prices were lower with an expanded selection and other menu items. You get what you pay for during lunch.I really was hopeful this place was going to be good. Sadly, my assessment of Chinese food in Las Vegas remains unwavering. Granted, I'm a native San Franciscan who grew up with Mandarin, Szechwan, and Cantonese restaurants all within a few blocks of each other. The Vegas Chinese food scene continues to bore and disappoint at any price point. Yawn. Like I said I really wanted to like this place. The owner is so nice and really trying hard to make a go of it. The prices are ridiculously low. I walked out with 7 pounds of food for $22. 3 large entrees and steamed rice. For value, you get a lot for a little $. I felt guilty paying so little so I tipped her well. 

Sweet and sour pork. Bleh. Obviously frozen pork, cheap voluminous breading and anemic peppers on the side. Pass.

Chicken fried rice. The clear winner. Inexpensive and would order again. 

Szechwan garlic chicken. Looked better than it tasted. Broccoli frozen prior to cooking, garlic non existent, and the sauce was more tasteless than Panda Express (the King of spewy Chinese food in my snobby opinion). 
No dim sum to be seen. 
Too bad. 
I'll just book my flight to SFO and head to the Richmond District or Chinatown the next time I have a hankering for good Chinese. :(Nice spot to meet up wit frenz & chill out...They got the upstairs 4 folks 2 get loud...Family area downstairs, if U got the kids...Amy & I went 2 this joint & thru down a few beers...DAMN!!!  Took us a memorable glass home 2...Food is aight...I-candy, 4 sho...Mimi's cafe is okay for me. its okay that it never made me crave for anything so i never came back... the service was good but the sandwiches we ordered was pretty dry. I can personally make a better tuna sandwich! the cappuccino i ordered was good though. Props to the cute decorations in the cafe though :)I've eaten at 3 or 4 Melting Pot locations around the country, and if I had been on yelp 7 years ago, I probably would have given this place 4 or even 5 stars.  The evening is fantastic, it takes about 2.5 hours or more, and it's a great pace.  You are never in a rush, and it's certainly a different way to dine.

So, when we went to Melting Pot last night, I was troubled to learn that the menu had changed.  The Big Night Out which we had shared so many times was gone, replaced with a more a la carte ordering system.  You order by the person now, still having to share the cheese and dessert courses with the table as a whole.  Already, I was annoyed by the change in the menu.  THEN, I open the wine list to find fewer than 10 wines by the glass in white, even fewer in red, and only a page of wines period.  This is much, much less than Melting Pot used to have. I pointed this out to our server, and she informed me I was correct, the wine list had been paired down significantly.  Apparently the decision was made to simplify things.  Of course, I imagine stocking pricier bottles was not paying off, and I certainly understand a restaurant needing to make changes based on the bottom line.  But, it certainly affected my meal and will affect my decision whether to come in the future.

The meal was a solid Melting Pot meal.  We had the Wisconsin trio, an excellent blend of cheeses.  We asked our server to go heavy on the blue cheese and garlic, and she obliged in spades.  Excellent flavor.  The cajun platter and lobster fusion were next, and while good, the meat course left a little to be desired.  I feel like the portions are smaller, but I can't prove this.  I will say the shrimp was the favorite meat, and that's saying something when we ordered a dish with steak and lobster.  A tip if you eat here, put the mushrooms and potatoes in IMMEDIATELY.  The potatoes still weren't completely cooked by the end of the meal.  That's always been an issue with Melting Pot.  I would think there is a way to fix it, but I haven't seen it yet.

The dessert was the star of the meal.  We had the white chocolate creme brulee.  White chocolate with caramelized sugar drizzled on top.  Excellent, very glad we tried the special dessert.  My favorite in meals past was always the main course, but today it was the desserts.  I'm not saying we won't come back to Melting Pot, but the chances are much slimmer than they were yesterday before our meal.I really wanted to give this place a higher score, but I wanna sleep at night.  I was excited to come here for two reasons I love pizza and of course all the buzz following this place.  Finally made it down and left pretty disappointed.  

Literally before I could sit down some one was hovering over me asking me what I wanted to drink.  Before I could look at the menu to see what they had, and they just stand there until you decide.  Being a swell guy and not wanting to feel uncomfortable and leave the kid standing there I just ordered a Coke. 

When the server arrived it was not the same person who took my drink order.  So I took a gander around the place and noticed they have the bus boys bun rushing the guests with drink orders before they sit.  My sister and I decided to try the hot and spicy fries for an appetizer.  When they came it looked like fries with a light sprinkle of pepper.  To be honest the fries had a odd smell and the flavor I was not a fan of at all.

Now the pie.  We went with the family favorite sausage and mushroom.  When it came out I was a bit surprised with the size.  But a good surprise of course.  Metro make a really good pizza.  If I would have just had the pizza itself I would given it a four star.  But the whole experience for me wasn't great hence the 3 star.  Maybe I was expecting too much from this place, but with all of there locations a bit far from where I live and having some other great places closer I don't know when I will be back.Selection seems decent.  I don't know why I don't like this store.  It scares me inside.  It seems all dark and crowded with people coming at me from every direction.  In short, it fires off my big-box-store-shopping-and-crowds panic attacks big-time.  The first time, I thought it was just because I'd had a very stressful week.  The second time, I decided that I just don't get along with this place and won't try a third.I was lucky enough to go to the Santa Monica Border Grill back in 1995 while I was visiting some friends in L.A., and was blown away by it. I was at a conference in Las Vegas this last week, and I was happy to see that there was an outpost of the Border Grill there as well - of course I had to try it.

I went during lunch one day, and had the guac to start, followed by the chicken chilaquiles. Whenever I am in Mexico, I try to eat chilaquiles for breakfast, so I was pleased to see them on the menu (even though it was lunch time). The chips were cooked well, but were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I though that maybe I had just received a bottom of the basket set (or something like that), so I asked for some new ones, but those were amazingly salty as well. Once I dusted a large amount of salt off the chips, though, they were good, as was the guacamole. The flavors were nicely blended, and they didn't skimp on the onion.

The chilaquiles were a disappointment, though. They were the "green" version (as opposed to red or, more rarely, mole chilaquiles), and the green salsa was very acidic. I like the flavor of tomatillos, but these almost tasted underripe, which made for a weird flavor mix with the queso fresco and the corn tortillas. The chicken in the dish came in big chunks of dry white meat, and didn't taste like it had been cooked with the rest of the chilaquiles ingredients at all.  It was very disappointing. For comparison, I was comped a free breakfast buffet at the Wynn, where they had what they called chilaquiles with eggs (really, it was more like a chilaquiles/migas hybrid) - the flavor profile of that dish was much more authentic than what I had at Border Grill. I know that people think highly of the Wynn buffet, but still, when the food at a restaurant that prides itself on authenticity is beaten by a buffet offering, that's a bad sign.

I'll hang on to my good memories of the Border Grill in Santa Monica, but I won't be going back to the Vegas one again.The good thing about this place is that it's somehow off the beaten path, despite being in the Mandalay Bay. And the food is solid. I had a steak salad and it was very flavorful, although they did dress the salad up a bit too much. If I have a salad the next time I go back (and I will), I'll be sure to ask for the dressing on the side. Also, the chips are yummy, chunky, made fresh in the back type chips, which is always a bonus.Once upon a time Chi-Chi's had the Seafood Enchilada, it had a creamy sherry sauce.  Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.

I hoped against hope that it was the same thing.

Unfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.

I grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.

My other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want "Fresh Guacamole". This is code for "Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.

The chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said "What's Chi-Chi's".  (Now I feel old!)

Overall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the QuesadillasI enjoyed this place and think it's the closest thing to a Philly Cheese Steak in Las Vegas that your going to get.  Not on the Philly level but not too far off.Decent Italian food in a good setting.I like Buffalo Exchange.  Its hit or miss for me, as a plus sized gal, sometimes its hard to find clothes that fit in a second had shop.

They have a good sized selection though, and I've found some gems.Pros: singer was very good, waitresses were attentive, food was good

Cons: location away from strip but not that far by car at all,  dark area outside by parking area feels unsafe, 

Sample platter was deliciousWow is all I have to say about the reviews for this place. Just seriously.... REALLY??

This Vons may be in a slightly "ghetto" area of town, but the store is perfectly fine and the staff is incredibly nice. In fact, the only reason this Vons could be considered "ghetto" is because of the snippy college students frequenting it for their beer runs and mini-fridge stuffing.

Any time I have ever run into this store on the way home from work I have been asked if I needed help finding something and the cashiers are friendly too.

If you think this Vons is "ghetto" please go and visit the K-Mart on Bonanza and Nellis. PUH-LEASE! Get it together people. This store is remodeled, ya, it's kind of old, but at least it is clean. The alcohol section is glorious and maybe it doesn't have a bakery, but there IS a bakery located in the same exact shopping center as this Vons. Get yo bread on there.Yes, you end up bumping into some very well-known "meatheads" in the industry when you workout here but...

Is is the cleanest and most organized? Hell to the no.
Is there enough cardio machines? Umm, this is a meathead's paradise, not enough cardio equipment and more room for weights.
Is the exercise class room open at all times so you can go in and do some of your own cardio workout or at least some stretching? Nope! It was locked when I was there (around 8:15pm on a Friday night).
Is the staff helpful? They're not the friendliest, that's fo sho.


Few good things I noticed while working out here during the Olympia weekend this year:

1. I like how they have hanging signs of each muscle group for the equipment in the room.
2. There's a cool boxing ring in the back.
3. They're open 24 hours.
4. They're cool with you taking pics of yourself. We were there working out a bit with the Flag Nor Fail crew and all they were doing in between sets were takin snapshots of each other. Haha!

Would I come back here? Eh...if we were meeting up with other cool peeps in the fitness industry, then sure...but not my 1st choice.For me their really isn't a worse way to shill something then to have to use UPS. If you have a business account they offer great service, but for the everyday Joe they are a total rip. 

Every shippment through them is twice as expensive and gets to the location in double the time. WTF.... The only benefit of he UPS store is not having to wait in the ridiculous USPS line and deal with some over worked, over paid Postal worker.I will go back  here even though I gave it a 3.  I still recommend this to anyone.

1.  They never asked me the heat level of the curries I ordered. Perhaps because I was with kids, and started with a wonton soup instead of Tom Yam, they assumed I wanted no heat level in the spice.

2.  I had a very hard time to hear the waitress over the loud music. The musician was great, however, I wanted to talk to my guests and it was a bit harder to do with the music.

3.  Ordered Wonton Soup, Rad Na, Red Curry Chicken, Masaman Curry Beef, and this most awesome half chicken fried. Not really a Thai dish, but a delicious fried chicken delicate and flavorful.

4.  They have a lot of Chinese food here in case you have to be careful wifh some of your guest and this is awesome. Some of their chinese dishes are absolutely great. How many places do you know you can get steamed fish?? That is special.

5.  Service overall was nice. I may have had a younger or new waitress, but also a more senior waitress came by during key times and she was very efficient!

I love the decor and the location. Parking is easy and not very busy for a Saturday night.  I am coming back here, because I think I was tired, a bit full from lunch still, and was trying different stuff.  This place seems like it will be a 4-5 the next time I come back.

Check it out and try it, you will be pleased!I qualify this review on the basis that the only time one needs to be at a mortuary is to make arrangements for a loved one.  My father had passed at the end of the month and I went to Las Vegas immediately since I was the closest of the out of town family.  Palm Mortuary was recommended highly and I was with my brother and mother to make the preparations.

First and foremost, we were assisted by one of my father's brother in arms, a Knight of Columbus member (this is a Catholic group that assists with Church activities).  I commend him for his guidance and his help to make the process easier.  The conversation with one of the directors went smoothly enough.  You know that you get the usual condolences and discussion of the process.  We had not gotten to look at the costs beforehand but were thinking, this is the process and we will  be told what and when and how much.  All of this went smoothly within the context of costs for the service and extras that might cost accordingly.  Besides the standard items, caskets, urns and memorial items for the service, the basic cost of the service, and of course the visitation room and chapel.  Our director mentioned that most Pilipinos like bringing food for the visitation and that since the funeral home has a chapel, the casket will be in that room from 1-7 and for another $1000 dollars for a separate room where one can host (meet) with family with food and drink.  it is not normally custom to have food and drink in the area.  Based on the cost and of course knowing my family, I knew we would not be interested in the extra room.  Grief can be done in the chapel along with my father's body in the casket.  We decided to forgo this decision until we discussed it with the rest of my family along with my mother who is in not in the mood to discuss such subjects in front of others.

After making some decisions, we informed Palm of our decision to forgo the extra room and was happy to have my father in the chapel for the visitation for the entire period 1-7.  We informed the mortuary within 2 days so that the room that was reserved can be used by others if any since this is still is a business.  But here is where everything became an exercise in the fine print.  As I mentioned before, we discussed the chapel for 1-7 and an extra room for $1000.  We dropped the extra room so we assumed the chapel would be our only room from 1-7.  Fine print, the chapel will only be used for 1 hour for any type of service.   This was not mentioned verbally and this  was what got my brother and my craw.  

After conversations with both the director and the manager of the director, we were told that we would have the visitation room from 1-4 and the chapel from 4-7 for any service(the Knights of Columbus does a prayer service).  This was really not the experience we were seeking.  So the warning for others, make sure you have the details and everything in front of you before you make a decision.  We were not price shopping for a funeral home, we wanted the best service with no hassle.  I am afraid we didn't get it at Palm.

Everything else went smoothly from the visitation the transfer from visitation to chapel, the service at the chapel.  Although I would like to say that the whole event ended on a good note, I can say that as soon as the mass service (the next day)  was over and my father's casket was taken away. I felt a little bit exhausted.  When the flowers needed at the church needed to be taken care of, Palm was so quick out of the box that I was not able to ask them to take them away (no one wanted it).

Positives, the service went smoothly. Negatives, fine print does no favors for the grieving. Positive you can purchase things outside of the funeral home, casket at Costco, flowers from known floral shops, memorials online and other places. Negatives, if you are grieving and have no time to do all of the work to look for these items, you will be gouged with prices at the funeral home.  It is a business after all.

I know you might never use this place but if you do, just make sure that you have someone who can be calm and collected to help you through.
Thanks Don!Burger and pizza nights are def worth trying. Some of the better pizza I have had. Breakfast is decent, but nothing exciting. Typical bar breakfast. Haven't tried their pasta, but want to. Service is ok.Stopped by to pick up some office supplies.  It's a clean store with friendly employees.  They had some interesting items for Christmas, but nothing I was going to buy.  I just needed to get my supplies and head home.  Not much else to say about this store.

Will I return?  Sure.Well, my order was wrong...but what I received was pretty darn tasty, so I can't complain too much. Fries were hot, and so was my sandwich.  That's about all I can ask for in a BK.This isn't anything trendy but as a local it's good spot. I could walk here from my house. So i used to come down to the bar and drink or go to the cheap cafe when i was hungry. I don't gamble so i couldn't tell you muh on that. the lodge atmosphere is really nice expecially when you remember your in a desert. Also I've had many conversations with other locals here. It's just a casual hang out. Also parking is never bad. Um the drinks have been good and cheap. Not as happening as other casions but hey... Sometimes a switch of pace is a good thing.The lady who helped me over the phone was very nice, as I've been calling other hotels to check for low rates for a little vacation for me and bf.  She was the best so far, she didn't seem to rush me off the phone, and answered all my questions not sounding annoyed lol.

The price for the stay is very nice and within my budget.  
What makes me happy also is that the pool is also open to the public as we live close by.I didn't stay here during my vacation however my casino experience was average. They have allot of the older gaming machines and some table games as well. I ended up earning enough points for a free buffet and have to say this was the worst experience. All the food I tried seemed to be undercooked. I thought it was just me and asked my friends what they thought of theirs and the said the same. Maybe it was just a bad day for the cooks but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.This is a very nice casino. Very classy for a local casino. I came here for a presentation event so I went to the second floor to one of the meeting rooms. I have to say once you leave the casino floor this place is not much nicer than a Hilton Garden Inn. 

I did look out over the pool and the pool looked really nice. I also checked the restaurant menus and they seemed a little pricey for a non-strip casino.I've dined here four times.....

The first time:
I ordered the turkey, swiss and pear wrap........WTF?  Flavor explosions with every bite.  So good, I knew that it could easily become a "go to" item when decisions had to be made on the fly.  Also, on the side, I order their famous bread in a pot.  If you LOVE fresh bread and carbs as much as I, you'll flip for this warm, doughy goodness!  (sigh)

The second time:
I ordered the Jamms breakfast sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, Texas toast.............typical flavors for a typical breakfast sandwich.  Yet again, I ordered the bread in the pot and it melted in my mouth!  It is the business!!!

The third time:
I was craving good 'ole steak and eggs so I made my way to the closest breakfast joint.  No, I'm lying, I wanted the bread in the pot!!!  =)  I'm a medium-rare, over medium kinda girl, and when the steak came out chewy and well done and the eggs, over-hard, I was terribly disappointed.  The only thing that was eaten that meal were the hash browns (you can't mess up potatoes, can you?) and the POT OF BREAD (of course)!

On my most recent visit to Jamms, I decided to order my "GO TO" turkey, swiss and pear wrap........decision well made, THANK GOD!  As usual, I ordered the POT OF BREAD, and LOVED every moment of it!
=)

~The service is wish-y wash-y at best.  One time I'll have over the top exceptional attention, and other times I'll be flagging the server down because I've gone 20 minutes (literally) without any sort of look my way.
~The menu is large........nearly 20 omelets alone!
~The POT OF BREAD is what keeps me coming back!!!  I dream about that bread!  Every time I drive past Jamms (which is often) I think about that bread!  UGH...........I want some NOW just writing about it!!!   =)
~I'll continue to give this place a shot......they can thank the POT OF BREAD for that! 
=)In the past I've experienced such terrible customer service at this location I dislike coming here but today I didn't feel like driving all the way to another location. Wow they have changed! As soon as I walked in I was greeted and felt welcomed by Marcia? I'm not the best with names....As I looked around I was confused why the product I was looking for was missing and some was dirty but Kelly came over and she cleaned the product that was dirty for me, asked me what I was looking for, gave me advice for similar product, checked in later to make sure I was ok and when I got in line! She was simply amazing. I've never felt so cared about! My cashier was Heather and she was shy but didn't care that I needed two separate purchases due to my coupons and asked me how I wanted my gift to be wrapped! She thanked me at the end for coming in and asked if I wanted my receipt with me or in the bag and when I said in the bag she actually put it in the bag unlike past cashiers I've had!! Marcia was still there at the door and wished me a wonderful day and thanked me. As a previous employee of this company it was just nice to feel at home again and not be disappointed. I hate bragging but after providing great customer service you do technically expect to have it and today they surely did that for me :) but this location can't go up to 4/5 stars until the company provides them with more product!!Well, we were downtown last weekend and happened to be hungry at an odd hour due to a very late breakfast that morning and so immediately I thought "Hey, lets go to Pizzeria Bianco. They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday." Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.

Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.

I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return.Being in Durant's reminds me of being a bit actor in a movie remake of some 1950s cult classic.  Like oceans 11.

The original had Sinatra and Martin and Davis, Jr and Bishop.  

The remake had Clooney and Pitt and Damon and Garcia.

And although the 2001 version was pretty good, maybe even VERY good, something about it seems disingenuous.  

But when we talk about the cool-factor of the 1960s "11", there is no denying that the film makes you feel like you're walking around like your number one.

Well, translate that into this dusty steak joint, that has somehow passed its prime and now seems like a poor remake of its former (classic) self.  Their food has sadly nose-dived into average, while their prices have sharply risen like a Vegas hotel room on a holiday weekend.

I only feel marginally dapper drinking in here.  Sure the bartenders are cool and quite aware, but the setting is dank and I feel like I'm drinking in an 80s mob bar that is trying to thematically play homage to a 20s speakeasy.  

Where once THIS was the steakhouse that others (even chains -- heya Bucco di Beppo) tried to emulate, everything just seems to have spindled out of order.  Its trying hard to work, but it just doesn't.  I'm also aware that they are under new mgmt and have changed some staples on the menu.  We shall see if they will return.

For now, I'm just going to stick to drinking the occasional scotch at the bar before moving on to Capital Grille or City Hall.Really nice food however it is very overpriced. $10 for guacamole is outrageous, even if it is prepared tableside.  The pollo mole is spicey with just the right amount of chocolate.  Service was nothing great, noticed the table next to us who had a different waitress got a lot more attention than our waiter gave us.  Would I go back again yes, but would like it much better if someone else was paying.Ok.  Let me start by saying that even though I'm a pretty confident guy, I don't consider myself to be "cool" or "hip" in any way.  I wear far too much plaid for that to be the case.  I was looking for a place in the area for a nice chai latte before heading to rehearsals, and this place had the highest / most reviews, figured I had to give it a shot.  I actually went in three different businesses looking for this one, so right off the bat I feel like an idiot.  I ordered my chai, even though I wasn't sure they had it - because there really is no menu displaying what your options are (I'm certain this is in an effort to be cool).  The beverage was ok, nothing special, but ended up costing me almost six bucks.  I will give them this - the ambiance is pretty amazing.  There are many places to sit and chill, lots of nooks and funky chairs, including a pretty cool back patio.  Outside of that, I just felt out of place and uncomfortable - despite the great soundtrack and pretty people.  So - I'm sure if I were cooler, or younger, I'd dig this joint, but it's just not my cup o' tea.The appetizers here are very good - both the crab puffs and the potstickers were solid.  The entrees are less so - the garlic chicken was okay but not great, the moo shu was meh. Huge chunks of veggies in the moo shu made it hard to eat, actually.  I also had the sizzling rice soup, which was pretty good though the broth could use a little more richness.I recently stayed here for 5 nights (in town for a friends wedding).  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room - while basic - provided all the necessities (even had a flat screen!).  The floor I stayed on was apparently just remodeled.  The observation deck on top provided an incredible view of the strip at night.  Several economical dining options were also provided (in the mall area, as well as roxy's diner).  The only reason I give it three stars is that cigarette stench permeated the casino floor.  The smoke smell also seemed to travel through the walls into the room we were staying in.  Additionally, the hotel is located at the far end of the strip. This requires guests to either have to take a cab (cost prohibitive), rent a car (annoying), or take the deuce bus (painful).  All in all, I had a pleasant stay and recommend the Stratosphere for the budget traveler.As a lover of burgers, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with the Keller burger (bison on ciabatta).  I ordered it medium rare, in case you're curious.  It was well cooked.  It just didn't taste all that great.  And the bun doesn't work.  I think it would fare better with a brioche or pretzel bun.   Others at my table ordered the more traditional burger, which I thought was a little better.  Maybe it was the level of expectation I had, but I was disappointed.  I've had much better offerings at 25 Degrees, The Counter, and Father's Office.  Thumbs up on the sweet potato fries, but a no-go on the onion rings and steak fries.  

Now about the good.  Excellent service.  The banana split with the caramelized banana - I can't complain about that!  Each booth has its own TV with ESPN.  Just wish the burgers were better!  Sorry chef Keller.  I liked you best on Top Chef Masters.Mickey's is...interesting. I dig all the different rooms, which make for nice places to get away and chat. The few times I've been there, the bar area is PACKED full, people are all elbows, and it takes forever to get a drink. 

I love the outdoor area, might be my favorite behind Jolly Bob's as far as that goes. 

Well, I guess that if you survive getting to and from the actual bar, it's a nice place.visited this spot on the spur of the moment because it's directly across from the capital where they do the concert on the square with a colleague and her dad from out of town. i love irish pubs. my staple is to immediately go for the fish and chips. i seem to judge a pub on this dish, aside from any ales they make on tap (if it's a micro brew). but my eyes scanned the menu and i got caught up with some very uncharacteristic choices. 

we ordered the sweet chili shrimp for starters. very nice skewer of large shrimp and who can resist sriracha sauce? for an entree i ordered the lemon pepper fettuccine in an olive oil with mushrooms, leeks and parmesan. you have a choice of chicken, steak or salmon, but because i was such a fan of the shrimp, i asked my server if i could order it with shrimp instead. she told me they didn't serve shrimp... huh? 

i reminded her that i just had shrimp for the app, and she goes, "oh! no, those are PRAWNS." i couldn't help but laugh at this. nonetheless, i asked her to check with the kitchen to see if that would be possible. when she returned, she said they couldn't do it. funny. how hard is it to sautee a few shrimp and toss them on some pasta. right about now i'm regretting not getting the fish and chips. but i simply order another shrimp app with the meal and tell her i'll put the shrimp in the pasta my damn self. sheesh. 

food is good though. a little heavy handed with the oil, but the texture of the noodles was good, the flavor was pretty nice and light, and of course the shrimp set it off. place was noisy like a pub which i liked and expected, happy people having a good time.  good beer choices as well. i'll be back for the fish and chips.Not a ton of vegetarian options, but what they do have is pretty okay. During busy times, it is *very* loud and unusually dark.Mediocre... Is the best way to describe my experience with los sombreros.  We have been anxious to try this place for a long time.  It had pretty good reviews and a friend of our recommended it for a late night happy hour.   
To begin our waiter was a snob, he acted like we were lucky to have him, and at one point he actually rolled his eyes at us... seriously.   The guacamole looked fantastic coming out of the kitchen, so we started with that.  It was good, but it and the chips needed salt and there was none on the table.   The menu was not vegetarian friendly unless I wanted to order an appetizer salad.  They had a special on the board called "Mushroom Quesadillas", so I asked the server what was in them... trying to make sure it had no meat.  He said basically mushrooms and cheese.  So I ordered those.  What I got was  essentially a mushroom and cheese tamale deep fried, No tortilla! It was okay, but I would never have ordered it if I knew what it was... which was why I asked.   Getting anything out of our server was like pulling teeth.  
The only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the chocolate cream pie dessert.  I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us, but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service.We weren't given the room type we reserved, though our reservations were made weeks in advance. They did give us an "upgraded" room with newer finishes, but with two smaller beds, no coffee pot and no refrigerator to use.  The gym has minimal equipment.  From Vegas and having visited The Palms many times before, this is not the place that I remembered.Nice enought place.  Very busy place. Great for groups wanting to have fun in Vegas.Good hotel, good service, clean, but showing it's age compared w/ the competition. I would stay there again. It's proxemity to lv convention center can't be beat.This is a late review but here goes. Fiance and I stayed here last October. We've both been to Vegas before but this was our 1st trip together. Everything about the place is sort of average to just slightly above. It was clean and had a decent size room but the casino is very under-whelming. We were out and about so much that it served the purpose of a decent place to catch a few hours of sleep between activities. Did not eat at any of the dining establishments as none caught our eye. The location off strip is a bit hindering but it is on the mono-rail which remedies that quite a bit. I will say if you are a sports junkie then definitely spend some time in their sportsbook. It was a pleasant surprise. Wouldn't stay there again but after hearing that Hilton is pulling out we do plan on going back for drinks and the sportsbook for the nostalgia factor.Lodged here plenty of times when it was a Hilton property as part of the Honors program - Good times = Great memories.

Booked on a whim to spend a weekend with the fellas minus the old ladies 'cause we got a deal too good to pass up. 

Turns out it was subpar visit. Aside from the busted A/C to the crowded cloudy-watered swimming pool, the staff was nice and friendly so that earns the 1st Star. 

Buffet was above average for the cost & selection - 2nd Star

I'm giving them a 3rd Star because if it wasn't so boring and dull here, we would probably have spent less time venturing out around town and finding the trouble we were looking for in the first place. 

Overall the LVH feels more accomodating as a family place, just not the type of atmoshphere I'd prefer to be around in the City of Sin.Wasn't the nicest place I've stayed, but far from the worst.  Hated the restaurants.  Very overpriced, and staff didn't seem happy to be employed. The worst valet service in Vegas. Waited 25 minutes to leave my car, and another 40 to get it backJust checked out this morning!

We were in the red room and it was decent. Basic room, basic layout, basic bed, basic bathroom. Everything was typical hotel room. 

Pros: easy walk from check in to elevators. Close places to bring food back to room.

Cons: weak shower pressure. Bad tv reception. 

I guess after that horrible room at the MGM I was so glad to have a bigger room, and a door on my bathroom. 

Would not mind staying here again.Obviously, the sushi is good, but the atmosphere is blah.  You can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes.  Here, you're paying for the name.Monte Carlo is starting to show it's age, but it's still a decent on strip bargain.
Tip- pay the extra few bucks for a room upgrade, the higher floors are in much better shape than the lower ones. Lower ones would get 1 1/2 stars from me- pretty bad.

Beds are comfortable, and the rooms are decent sized. They now give you two in room complimentary coffees (Keurig, not too bad)  to save you the hike down to the Starbucks at the food court. The CVS next door sells Keurig pods,  so you can stock up, if you are a heavy coffee drinker like myself.

Alarm clocks with phone docking station.

The resort fee (and extra $20 on top of the room rate) includes the coffee, WIRED in room internet, newspaper, and gym usage.

Pool is very good, but they have added too many cabanas, and now seating is pretty difficult, unless you show up around opening time. Pool closes at 7. They sell and rent floats for the lazy river ($10-20). Beers are about $8. DJ on the weekends.

Valets do a good job, so do the bellhops,  and the maids tend to do a much better job on the higher floors...a decent tip will certainly help in all these areas, and  is much appreciated.  Front desk service is good.

Skip the Buffet- go to Aria, Bellagio or Wynn. All good bets. The room service is fairly reasonable for Vegas.

All in all, you can certainly do worse, and the cheap rates and good pool keep me coming back. if you don't care about the pool however, I would keep looking. You can stay at a much nicer place for another $50 or so a night.My husband and I brought our two sons and three of their friends to Las Vegas as a birthday surprise for our younger son. We chose the Monte Carlo because we thought they would enjoy the pool area, and they really did.  If it weren't for the pools, we might have changed hotels. It wasn't awful, but we really wanted everything to be perfect for this trip. We travel a lot for business and are used to overlooking a lot. There are a lot of minor irritations with this stay that will lead us to stay elsewhere next time. 

The check in process took a half hour to get one of our three rooms. It was early, so we were okay that all the rooms weren't ready but taking that long when we wanted to get to the pool was a bummer. We were told that our reservation is only a request for a certain room type and they wouldn't guarantee an adjoining room for the guys or a king room for my husband and I. When we finally got our room, we were told it was a king but we got there and it wasn't. We ended up getting a king but had to give up the strip view we reserved. Not a big deal, but pretty disorganized. 

The rooms are okay - nice linens and the decor is fine but the bathrooms are pretty dated. The Internet is only available via a cable so no Internet for devices other than a laptop.  The room seemed clean but there was a towel in our bathroom with urine on it that I almost used on my hair. Thank god it fell on the floor with the pee side up or I wouldnt have noticed it.  I let the front desk know so they could let their staff know to watch for stuff like that. They apologized and ordered a full cleaning for our room.  For some reason half the lampshades in the rooms I was in looked like someone sat on them. Kinda weird. 

All in all the Monte Carlo is pretty decent but I will try a different place next time. I wanted to treat everyone to the Blue Man Group but the best discount the hotel offers still leaves tickets over $100 per person - pretty hefty for our group of seven. Stay here if you want a fun pool area, just don't expect too much out of the rest of the experience.The show was great, the performers were awesome but the crowd management was horrible. Customers entered at-will during the entire show and created a distraction by obscuring the view of the stage. They do a better job at a baseball game...

If you go see the show, sit in the front row.I had been looking forward to this show for about 3 years! For some reason, every time I've been to Vegas in the past 3 years (About 4 times), Zumanity was on hiatus (holiday weekends off, maybe?). Anyways, after all that hype, I was a little disappointed.

Highlight:
- Edie the drag queen host was effing hilarious and was great at improv with people in the crowd
- The Sex Therapist Couple: the woman was hilarious! Especially her "Scotch baggies" skit. I was laughing so hard!

Low Light:
- Racist black people dancing like animals with bongo music playing. Wtf? There were no other race-related/stereotypical dances that happened!
- If you don't sit at stage-level, you might as well not go. My husband and I sat on balcony level because we heard the cast brings people on stage and wanted to avoid that at all costs. However, we were penalized seeing only about 60% of the impromptu stuff with the crowd in the beginning and at random times during the show
- The show wasn't that sexy! It was definitely more of a scantily-clad circus than anything else

Unforgettable Moment:
- The bondage skit had everyone in the entire theater holding their breath. It was so sexually-charged! 

My recommendation:
Go see them with a comp ticket, travel deal, or with the savings they are offering with this being their 10th year anniversaryI was really expecting a lot more from the Venetian.

When we arrived at the hotel I was so excited.   It's such a huge place and seems really beautiful.  Upon closer inspection it's really plastic and fake.  Then you open the doors and are hit with the most nauseating, cloying perfume scent.  It's like the scent of concentrated cheap laundry detergent.  It is apparently pumped throughout the lobby and main areas of the hotel.  We then saw the winding line of weary looking travelers waiting to check-in.  I actually felt my heart sink.  Fortunately a hotel employee directed us to the elevator and told us to check-in on the 2nd floor.  I'm pretty sure this saved us half an hour or more.  

It took two elevators and about 5-10 minutes to get from the lobby to our room.  The hotel is MASSIVE being attached to the Palazzo.  Our room was spacious and nicely air-conditioned.  The whole room was sort of beige and not really as pretty as I would expect.  Our view was so-so.  Not much to see on the non-strip side.  The bedding was awful and scratchy.  I would have expected soft sheets and down or fluffy duvets for a hotel that calls itself 5 star.  Instead it was a somewhat stained and icky bedspread.  We didn't hear any noise at night which was nice.  The rooms are definitely showing their wear.  The worst part was opening the fridge to check out the goods and finding a styrofoam container of the previous occupants leftovers.  Some nasty looking buffalo wings or something that had clearly been there for days.  You would think they'd check the fridge!  

The printer in our room did not work and even after we got new ink cartridges it still didn't work.  We told the front desk when we checked out but she just scribbled something on a piece of paper that I'm sure is sitting in a recycle bin right now.  

The swimming pools and hot tubs are fantastic and completely enjoyable.  They were the best part of our trip.  They are packed to the brim with college-aged kids and 20-somethings working off their hangovers and perfecting their tans, which was kind of icky.  It mellows out during the week and at dinner time and becomes a great place to hang out.

Our reservation confirmation had Free Continental Breakfast in bold letters yet we didn't get any coupons for it.  We decided we'd try and get breakfast but were quickly denied at the door.  We went to talk to the front desk and were again denied.  Finally my girlfriend pulled up the actual confirmation email on her phone to show the guy and he handed us our passes.  Sill we were shorted a pass as there were three people staying in our room.  I felt like the whole thing was kind of cheap.  The breakfast was OK.  The pastries were grocery store quality, the coffee was pretty bad.  The bananas and apples were really brown and sad-looking.  The juice and oranges were edible.  

The restaurants inside The Venetian were all good.  We particularly enjoyed the Mexican place.  Prepare yourself to pay a lot for food.  I don't know if that's Vegas in general or just the restaurants of the Venetian/Palazzo.  We also really liked the Italian place - Dal Toro.  I felt like the cost of the food was equality to the quality and I'd go to them again even if I wasn't staying at The Venetian.

In general The Venetian is packed with the same types of people -"bargain" hotelers (us), 20-somethings straight out of the Jersey shore, and unknowing international travelers. It's not a place full of high rollers. 

I'm not sure if I would come back to The Venetian or not.  I suspect there are better hotels on the strip for more money, which is worth it to me.No wonder this hotel was featured in the movie "Vegas Vacation". Between the jungle feel of the casino, the mini-volcano out front and Siegfried and Roy (RIP), this hotel - the first of the Strip mega-resorts - has enough hokey Strip personality (now almost a cliche), to fill ten thousand coin buckets.  The last time I stayed here was five years ago, and I understand from others who've stayed more recently that it has deteriorated but the parent company, MGM Mirage, is planning major renovations.Disclaimer: I'm not a Vegas guy. Neither my wife and I dig the Vegas vibe but we (son included) wanted to see The Beatles Love show, so we chose The Mirage.

No complaints really. Pool/Strip view room was great and reasonable (Thurs-Fri). Staff was helpful, many eateries on site and the pool was a kick with waterfalls. Being there with an 11 year old we weren't interested in the clubs, and we're not gamblers, but the resort has plenty to offer in that capacity. Good In-Room dining.

One note for parents: The Beatles themed clubs aren't family friendly as some might think. Example - As we headed back to our room on Friday the Revolution Lounge had girls dancing in the letters...Not a big thing but for a Tween it might mean a lot of filtering/explaining away.

The Beatles Love show was excellent. Really imaginative, creative and inspired.Although I am a Vegas veteran and have been to MGM many times, I stayed here for the first time this Christmas. We stayed in the West Wing for 2 nights. 

I had originally booked the very basic room, but at check in I was upgraded for free to the West Wing. (FYI - you can check in at the airport. Look for the MGM desk behind baggage claim.) The West Wing rooms were modern but small, reminding me of rooms in cities like NY and SF. The bathroom was especially cramped - no tub, little vanity space, toilet and shower separated by an opaque glass divider. We couldn't find room for the trash can without blocking the door of either the shower or the toilet closet. The room also featured a scale. Note to MGM - I don't want to weigh myself in Vegas. 

But I will say the West Wing is conveniently located with good signage directing you to it throughout the casino. One concern I had with MGM is that it would be too, too big, and the West Wing took you away from the monstrosity of the main hotel tower. 

I think MGM has one of the best sports books in Vegas, and I like the Stage Deli that is immediately next to it. The buffet was yummy (my surprising favorite selection? brussel sprouts!) and the food court had a Nathan's Hot Dogs! The pedestrian bridge between MGM and NYNY is a handy way to get to the other side of the strip. 

I'm convinced the lions on display are drugged, but interestingly the motorized alligator at the Rainforest Cafe seemed to be a more popular attraction. 

As far as fine dining, the selection there is growing. I've eaten at Emeril's place there and enjoyed it, but it was ten years ago so I don't feel I'm qualified to give a thorough review. The resident Cirque show, KA, is excellent. 

In a nutshell - MGM is a solid, albeit nothing special, choice.Location is great, restaurants are great. The rooms are dated, and the remodeled ones are kind of weird. Lets just say there is no privacy when you go to the pooper, echos like a motha.This is probably a 3.5 star review, but I can't go up to 4.  We stayed at MGM during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, so it was way crowded.  This is to be expected.  However, what was not expected was MGM doing work on the 24 hour coffee shop, which is typically the best (and at least most reliable) place to get breakfast in a casino.  It was poor planning to have this construction going on during one of the busiest Vegas weekends.  So, that was annoying.

The rooms are solid but not spectacular.  One thing that's nice about MGM Grand is there is a broad spectrum of things to eat, from a food court to Joel Robuchon.  Craftsteak is always a winner in my experience.  You have a good amount of dining options here.

I've been to several concerts at the Grand Garden Arena.  They do a great job of getting you in and out quickly.  

Front desk staff is very courteous, as is the MLife staff.  Dealers as well.  Very solid hotel all around.The rooms are dark. They should have more light in the room. Also there's no fridge or microwave. I understand not having an microwave. The LCD TV is small, I think it's a Phillips 32". The hot water is not hot enough when you take a shower or bath. The big negative is that here's a Resort Fee (about $20). They should just add this to grand total not try to hide it. 

I watched the Pirate show in front of the hotel which was okay. My room was in the back on the 8th floor and I was surprise that we can not hear the sound from the pirate show which is a plus.

The good part about Treasure Island is that the hotel is in the middle of the strip. Well, to me the hotels between Wynn and Paris Paris/Bellagio (maybe Planet Hollywood) are the central of attraction. Anything beyond it you're not missing much. You might want to visit Fremont Street also.it was good. but it was Vegas so it is what it is everything was kinda on the expensive side though for treasure island and there was not a fridge in the room and every time we called room service they would be like and hour wait so it was a little aggravating but nothing we couldn't deal with. plus the view from our room was to die for and made up for everything.Stayed here for 3 nights, only reason to stay here is the price, (older hotel) comes with a sunk-in bed. I realize its Vegas but the channel selection for TV not so great.  Average buffet, and decent gaming.  If you stay here you probably won't be spending much time at this place, with everything else that better offered on the strip.  Will definitely be staying at a newer hotel for my next stay.Definitely not the fanciest hotel in Vegas. But, it is centrally located, right in the heart of the strip.   And it is cheap.  Vegas is not the kind of town where you spend a lot of time in the room, you know?  Get one person to stay at the Bellagio so you can hang buy the pool on Saturday (get there early), then go to Rehab at the Hard Rock on Sunday.   Spend your money on doing fun things, not your room.ehhh......
a group of friends and I came here on our last morning before leaving Vegas.  I got the Gabi Chopped Salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  It sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and chicken crepe.  They all hated it.  I took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  Someone else got the ham and cheese crepe and it was supposidly better than the mushroom crepe.  Another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have American cheese.  The fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  The last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  They all said the frites were kind of weird though.

I would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever.Many people recommended Mon Ami Gabi to me for some time.  I decided to give this place a whirl and have dinner for my friend's birthday here.

I made reservations for our party of 4 for a Sunday night at 6:30pm on opentable.com.  Outdoor patio seating which has a view of the Bellagio water show is available but I believe it's on a first come, first serve basis.  We were lucky enough to get an inside table that had that view.  Note: they will not seat you until your entire party is present.  

The steaks were usually recommended to me.  I decided to order steak classique ($24.95).  I wanted a smaller piece of steak and our waitress made these steaks sound appealing saying that they were pounded down to about half an inch thick and would be extremely tender.  I ordered it medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium well which had very little pinkness to it.  It was a bit tough and wasn't flavorful as I expected.  I had a bite of my friend's filet and that was delicious.  If I would've gotten that, Mon Ami would've received another star from me.  The accompanied fries were DELICIOUS.  The fries were cut thin and deep fried until crispy and very few soft pieces remained.

As an appetizer, we ordered the Escargot de Bourgogne ($10.95) which was yummy.  Six pieces of escargot was marinated in a garlic herb butter sauce which also made great dipping sauce for the bread.

Our waitress was nice but the servers were usually the ones that were more helpful.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.  They brought him a small dessert with a candle (he didn't like us singing happy birthday lol).

Keep in mind, dinner is long and there is a lot of wait time between dishes.  I believe our dinner took more than two hours therefore don't dine here if you're crunched on time.

P.S. Think twice if you're ordering a drink. My friend ordered a Hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.  Turns out the drink was $21.There is a waiting line if u want to dine on the patio, you can wait at the bar and spend $11 for a Mimosa or spend your money gambling in the casino. Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower.I think this place used to be great.  Now, I feel like it's alright.  There's a lot of hype for big pieces of steak which I'm just not that into anymore. My food was undercooked and my mom's was waay to well done. Overall good atmosphere, although they try to maximize their customers and cram everyone into tight spots.For me, the Peppermill was just ok.  Maybe it was my choice in food, maybe it was the fact I was about to go get a tattoo, and that was on my mind, but either way, this place didn't WOW me.  Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.

The coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.

Basically, not sure if I will go back again- maybe to check out the fireside lounge, but for me it really didn't rock my world.The Flamingo is one of the old school Casino/Hotels in Las Vegas. Most of it's contemporaries have been torn down or are on their way down. Desert Inn, Stardust, etc. 

Hilton bought it quite a while ago to add it to their huge flagship Hilton on the north end of the strip near the convention center (well at the time it was huge, now it is being dwarfed by new projects). 

It has been remodeled and spruced up by Hilton, and now it really serves as a mid-level Casino/Hotel offering for Hilton in Vegas. Hilton has several large Condo/Timeshare properties now for non-casino vacationers, and the Hilton still serves as the flagship. But, a few years ago, Hilton sold this property to Harrah's Group. 

As such, the hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and in this town where the hottest thing is whatever is the latest and largest, the Flamingo dwarfs in comparison. 

Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the large tropical courtyard with its lush greenery. They do offer a lot of cheap room specials, so it isn't a bad choice for value travelers who still want some Vegas luxury, and don't want the riff raff in the next room that comes at the Circus Circus, Hooters, Stratosphere or Excalibur.Always fun in the casino, the history of this place is so special it's hard not to have funNot that bad! I was nervous to book it hotel after reading the reviews on here,it is not that bad. We have a room facing ceasars palce. Location and veiw was amazing! Huge bathroom great customer service.Pretty nice hotel. Use the kiosks to check in for sure. Service was actually really friendly here. Some parts of the hotel are kind of ghetto but even in that part the rooms were nice. We also had a great view. Location is great and price was too.This is our second time staying here.  The last time was a few years back for a wedding held at this hotel.  We thought it was nice enough for the price and location to stay there for this recent trip.

I would say it's a no frills kind of hotel.  The rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller.  They have done some room upgrades since our last stay (some type of synthetic hard flooring, better than carpet).  This is not important to me , but I found it rather funny that part of the room decor was upgraded (bedding, flooring) and some were not (tables/dressers/bathroom).  If you don't care about staying in a trendy hip hotel, this is your place.  It's a decent place to rest your head, located halfway down the strip.

There is a new street (Link) located next to the Flamingo, so that's a bonus.  You don't have to wonder too far from your hotel to find a fun place to hang for the night.I can see where this place can go wrong. I had a decent experience. The entry level room is nothing to brag about but the pyramid hotel structure is really cool. Im interested in knowing how much theyre going to charge me for the missing hotel room glass. My bro on the other hand had the tampon in the hotel room toilet experience which matches up well with other reviews on yelp. I wont go back but wont badmouth this place either. The pool was real chill, good place for some r&rRooms are old and dingy. Stuff was broken in my room but they fixed it in a day. Crappy TV, no Wi-Fi - have to use a long lan cable. Casino is ok, some low limit tables which I like. Some decent clubs in the hotel. One of the decent cheaper hotels.Stayed here last night. First off, they charge a mandatory "resort fee" of $15/night ontop of the room charge. This fee is "for your convinience" and is not advertised until you show up to check in. It includes wifi, a newspaper, and a telephone in your room. A total rip off. People checking in were furious about this and the hotel will not budge. If you don't pay it they cancel your reservation. Well, the Wifi signal was weak, I never got a newspaper, and I have this thing called a cell phone so didn't need a room phone. I don't know how they can legally do this its a total scam.

The elevators were totally ghetto. Walls grafitiied, buttons smashed in, mirrors broken. Looked horrible.

The room was nice. The bathroom was clean and just remodeled. Huge shower. The carpets are worn and stained. Some electrical outlets were lose. No iron or safe in the room. The TV sets were small and at least 20 years old.

Would I stay here again... yes. For the price of $40 I can't complain.

I would say just remodel the place and give the common areas a good scrub down. The entire hotel is really showing it's age. Needs to be renovated.Dear Luxor,

I want to like you. I mean, come on, you're a giant pyramid. However the 45 minute check-in line on a week day (not exaggerating) and the ten minute check-in process that made the line make more sense (still serious) was painful. 

What's even more painful? Being on the same side of the hotel as the pool -- that means being forced to listen to a very loud and proud rendition of Bruno Mars and every other top 40's hit at 8 a.m.. Sometimes your guests want to sleep in. Sometimes they don't want to be barraged with bad pop music until 10 o'clock. 

That brings me to my next point... the pool and hot tub are only open till 8. (Everyone told me all things in Vegas are 24 hours, your pool doesn't even stay up as late as my grandparents.) And your work out room closes at 7?

I want to like you, Luxor, I really do. You can start right now by turning down the music and restarting it in an hour with something sexier like Portishead or Goldfrapp. Please and thank you.

Yours,

NaomiWe started our weekend at the Luxor with a major negative. After checking in, we lugged all our suitcases and bags all the way through the Luxor, up the elevator and then nearly all the way around the pyramid only to find out that our assigned room already belonged to someone. There were clothes strewn about the room and everything! Major fail!

However, upon learning about their error, the hotel staff upgraded us to a suite without further question. The suite was great. We had a jacuzzi tub in our room and an extra living room, which gave us the much needed space to spread out our stuff. The room was clean and comfortable and even had a mini fridge.

One downside we quickly found about staying at the Luxor is the elevator system. Elevators are located at each of the points of the pyramid base but only go to a specific group of floors, often leading to a lot of extra walking. The elevators are also shaky, not sure if this is caused by age of the angle that the elevators travel at as it climbs the side of the pyramid.

The location at the end of The Strip also makes it difficult to get around. Next time I'll prefer to stay somewhere more central. But at least now I can say that I've satisfied my 10-year-old curiosity of what it would be like to stay in the giant pyramid.We stayed here for a couple nights just to experience what it's like staying in a pyramid. 

The staff was friendly and check in was pretty fast because they have a lot of staff. We stayed on the 18th floor and the view was nice inside and out. The elevator ride up was interesting..didn't expect to move sideways..we were caught off balance.lol 

The only negative thing I would say is the walk from your car to your room is pretty far. We did valet when we had to check in and I'm glad we did because it would suck to have to carry all our luggage with us.

Which I just remembered about their valet. The service was bad..there was a line of cars the guy had me go to the side and pull up to the cone. We got out of the car and started taking out our stuff and then the guy moved the cone and told us that we need to move forward! Seriously?! So we put our stuff back in and moved the car all the way and then the guy didn't even call anyone for us to help us with our luggage, my gf had to go find someone. Luckily the guy that helped us with our luggage was awesome! I don't remember his name but he was super friendly!

The hotel is just ok of course you can find some place better for the price. It's just a hotel to stay for a couple nights to experience the pyramid.Get me outa here!

Can I say that as the beginning of my review?  I'll bet you guessed I don't like Vegas too much.  Only here for a conference, so this is survival we're talking about here...

ANyway, the conference center is at Mandalay Bay, and seemingly there isn't a slot machine in sight.  Nor a gambler... just lots of geeks doing geek stuff!

I'm sure I'll survive though, just have to make it until Thursday when I speak... 

I should say something about the conference center.  It's clean, and immense.  Last year they had more bean-bag chairs to sit on, but very few this year it seems.  Also there's no wifi, at least it's not turned on yet.  Soon I'm guessing...I'm going to keep this one short:

1 star for:
THE ELEVATORS - we had to wait in lines sometimes for 20 minutes or more before we could get on an elevator - especially during checkout on Sunday (we walked down 21 flights instead).

2 stars for:
Location - all the way at the south end of the strip. A little far from everything except the airport...
Restaurants, shops, hotel entertainment - very expensive. Example? $17 sunscreen and $6 bottles of water. WTH?

3 stars for:
The rooms - comfy and clean, but you can hear everything in the halls.
The wave pool - way too crowded and the pool was just kind of gross.
Lazy river - fun, but doesn't come with flotation devices so we just walked through it - tons of children there!

4 stars for:
Landshark Lagoon - peaceful fun (21+ only), great waitress service, cornhole/bags, hot tub and a nice shallow pool to wade through.

We spent most of our time at the pool or out and about in Vegas. I would rather stay at a more centrally located hotel next time.Nothing like an auto weapon in your hand and target before you.  A mere 25 rounds does not make for prime time shooting, but it beats a day shopping with a metro-male.
No reservations and a standing in line wait costs stars, but this place stays busy so weigh out your values.
The staff know what that they are doing and provide crowd control so some bubba is shooting you with an weapon on auto.  :-)We were in Vegas for 3 days and I wanted to try a really good steakhouse. I told my husband I wanted to go to Craftsteak for dinner and made reservations. We showed up 15mins early and was seated right on time of our reservation. The service was great and very helpful. The food was excellent and cooked perfectly! The only complaint is why do you have to be located in the MGM?? It's doesn't help when your trying to have a nice dinner when you have two guys and a girl next to us and one of the guys was passed out! Oh and on the way out I had to use the restroom and two girls were puking! Kinda spoiled my nice dinner! Next time I'll stick to Del Frisco's or stripsteak where it is more classier.Not bad Not bad. Our server was really fun and nice. We got SOOOOO MUCH food because we had our meal comp'd by a friend. 

I didnt like the shredded pork tacos much. Fish tacos were BOMB! Nachos were BOMB! I cant remember what else I ate cuz I downed a few beers but I remembered it was BOMB.COM!Great atmosphere!
The tortillas are fresh but extremely greasy. The Guac was average.Been here two times in the past year and both times have been completely different from one another, so I guess I'll break it down for you:

First Time -- 1/5 Stars (A few months ago) -- The waiter had NO CLUE what he was doing. I have a Rock Star card at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, so they were supposed give us this deal where you got 99 cent tacos and margaritas for Happy Hour. He said he'd take care of us and he'd be right back with our food. 15 Minutes later, he came back and said he couldn't offer us the deal for some reason, because it wasn't the right time, or something but because he messed up, he'd give us a few tacos for the 99 cent offer. The guy literally took 45 mins to get us our food and drinks!! Definitely a bad experience and I was not too pleased at all. 

Second time (2 Weeks Ago) -- It was awesome!! Waiter was real friendly and gave us good recommendations. The quesadillas and the enchilada platter were awesome! My only complaint was the margarita, while tasting great, was kinda small since it was like $12 and I finished it pretty quickly. Otherwise, the place had great food, a good selection of modern mexican food, and great service. 

Overall, if I had a great experience both times I was there, I would probably give the place a 4, possible 5!Good tacos but overpriced for what you get, chips n salsa are mediocre.I agree largely with the review by HollyT. We went to Bouchon for my rehearsal dinner, it was actually Holly's idea. The server was one of these East Coast fast talker types, quick with the one-liners and so forth. That part was entertaining, as everyone was just happy to be eating together and it fits the Vegas atmosphere, but I can see how some people would prefer more subdued service (especially considering the amount of dough being dropped).

The B.L.T. (sous vide) was the highlight for me. Not that it was remarkable but I appreciate the process of it being cooked and the presentation. The food overall was great, just not spectacular. I agree with Holly's assessment that the appetizers were not impressive. 

As Holly said the barstaff paid a lot of attention to proper wine glasses throughout the meal, but then they served an after dinner cognac in a little champagne flute type thing. I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure you're just supposed to serve cognac in a brandy snifter so your hand warms up the alcohol as you drink it. 

The other deal breaker for me was that they served freakin' TAP WATER with the meal. Granted, they asked us before eating if we wanted Evian or mineral water, but when people are spending $1200 on a meal (including drinks) you should not even give them an option for "Las Vegas's Finest," as the waiter put it. The tap water didn't even have ice.

Anyway, we had a great time. As Holly noted, my wife was choking on some steak at one point. The restaurant made sure she was fine and treated us to some excellent desserts to help celebrate our occasion. When you're at a high-end place like this, though, the devil is in the details. You don't serve god-awful tap water, you put more care into the appetizer dishes, and you don't put cognac on the menu unless you have the proper glassware to serve it in. I give it also 3 1/2 stars, but I'll round down to 3 because the expectations are high for this restaurant.3.5  only because no chicken and waffle and the waitstaff hatin on all of dis!!!!

   This is for breakfest.......

So came in with the PIC  and boy I never been stared down so much in my dining life. Mostly by the patrons but there were these two waiters that killed me. One chick and one dude. They were only 6 feet from our table and she whispered something to him and he turned to look my way and they went back to talkin shit!!!!! Who does that. At least go in the back and talk your shit! Whatever I know him and I very opposite in looks but we ain't new he's my PIC GAWD DAMN IT! And it is what it is! 

 Ok so scale the menu and even look at the specials and I don't see the crack chicken and waffles I kept frakin reading about and seeing in pics!!!!!!! Didn't want to ask about it, I was just damn hungry! So scaled the menu and couldn't figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch because both sound great!

 Our waitress was nice unlike those losers that tried talking shit on me.  We started off with some champagne cocktails. I think I ordered Strawberry fields and it was deeeeeeeeeelish! I loved that drink and I could drink more but I really don't like drinking when the suns still up!  Onto the food we ordered. I ordered this dish with some bomb toast, potato sphere lookin thing lol eggs and sausage. PIC ordered the french toast and the side of bacon.  Everything looked like basic breakie BUT it was tassssty and fresh. The side of bacon was a BIG side of bacon. Im telling you like 8 pieces of thick cut bacon. I love putting sugar on my bacon and that hit the spot! I had no complaints from this breakfast. Straight to the point brekie, not fancy schmancy. PIC didn't say much about his dish since hes no foodie like me!

I will comeback here but if I see those two shit talking waiters, Im dropping a drink on both of their bobbleheads!Went to bouchon with a group for dinner. I guess I'm only giving it three stars because at that price point I would go elsewhere and because it didn't quite meet expectations which were admittedly high expectations.

We started with some cocktails which were very well made, strong and with great flavor. They also served bread and some excellent spread - I believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb. I would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if I could. Honestly, for me, it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal.

For an appetizer I got a squash soup which was quite tasty, but I've had better squash soups at Michael Mina, Circo, Mastros, etc. which are roughly the same price range. Again, it was good though, the flavor was there and the consistency was very good.

My entree was the braised short rib. This was the other highlight of the meal. It was cooked to perfection - soft, tender, melt in your mouth good. And unlike many other nice places, they didn't skimp on the sauce they put around it which I was very pleased about. The rest of the plate left something to be desired though, it came with some greens and as I recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein.

Desserts were entirely forgettable. As is the case with so many nice places and group meals they don't actually ask or provide desserts, but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form. This is always so disappointing because if there's something good, there's so little of it. But to be honest, there wasn't much good, plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams.

For me, Bouchon is good, but I'd rather go to one of the Strip's many other top restaurants.The negative: I made a reservation weeks in advance and asked to be seated by the Fountains. Apparently, they don't take reservations for that even though they give you a box on their online reservation form for requests. Go figure! When we were shown to our seat the hostess was very rude when I asked if there was something by the fountains. I didn't like the setup of the tables inside. We had a table along the wall that had the bench seat on one side and chairs on the other. The bench cushions sunk in, which made eating sort of difficult and the table next to us was pretty close. I think that makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dinning experience. 

The positive: The food is wonderful! My steak was cooked to perfection. The wine list was great. The service was good too. Nelson, our server, was on top of everything. I always like a restaurant that keeps my water glass full and fresh.I had a blast here the first time around. Girl dancers in cages, trapeze artist hanging and moving all over the place, the lighting and decor, sound system and the tunes..the beautiful people....We had so much fun that we didn't mind the overpriced drinks and how hard it was to get them....

The second time around, I was so excited, until my soiree got duped into getting a table reservation. The host and I, after much haggling and mathematical computations, came to a deal: 1 bottle purchase (@ $350up) and 2  heads out of the 8 of us will have to pay cover at $50 dollars each. To make sure I heard right, I ask the host again and she said "Cost of bottle plus $100 cover...that's it."


Now, it doesn't take a genious to figure out why I agreed to this deal. Basically, it's $450 for a table for 8 with all the service that comes with the bottle purchase....as opposed to $40/head for cover  - that's $320 - but no place to seat when you get tired dancing and having to struggle getting drinks at $12 a pop. It was a steal considering other places would require 2 bottles minimum purchase for a party of 8.

To make the story short, we're now comfy at our table and they rang the bottle before opening it...and it ended up costing $600 dollars after gratuiities and all assortments of tax which the host forgot to tell us about, who, by the way, had the audacity to ask me for her own tip because she "..really helped". It's still cheap but that wasn't the point. We were gonna get duped into paying something that we didn't agree on.

Anyway, it ruined the mood for everyone. We stepped out of the club without the $100 cover charge.Came here with my girlfriends for breakfast and a late dinner (after the club) one weekend. The diner was packed when we came early for breakfast. There was about a 10 minute wait before my party of 7 was seated. I ordered the Classic Rock entree which is your typical breakfast food - eggs, toast, hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate. 

Dinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt. (Okk...whatever!) 

Anywho, breakfast here is pretty good. The dinner here may also be great, but I would highly recommend you not to order any of their dinner specials! It comes with a side of rudeness topped with extra ATTITUDE if you don't like your meal!!!I went to Shibuya for dinner after reading some good reviews. I sat at the sushi bar and it was a bit cramped. Overall the decor is very modern and sophisticated. I liked the look of the place. 

My server came over and I was pleased to find they had Justin Cabernet on their list. It is one of my favorite wines. I ordered a glass which arrived promptly. I ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and an order of the fatty tuna to start. The food arrived expediently. Now, here is my issue- I love Nobu so this place was behind the eight ball. The rock shrimp were very tasty but the portion was so small. It was $21 for a bowl the size of a miso soup bowl, with these small little shrimp doused in spicy mayo. Nobu's tempura rock shrimp are much larger and actually come in a dinner sized portion. I would have thought Shibuya's tempura rock shrimp was an appetizer had I not been explicitly told it was an entree. And as an "entree" it comes with nothing else. 

The fatty tuna was delicious, don't get me wrong. I'm accustomed to paying $20-25/2 piece sashimi. I was told the market price was $40. I was craving it so I got it and it was fresh and awesome but it seemed a little steep. My waiter came back around and I was still hungry so I got the salmon and avocado roll. It was some of the best salmon I've ever had. However, my waiter was harried, being in charge of literally the entire bar and some tables behind us. It seemed that on a busy weekend night, there should have been more help. I had ordered another glass of wine but it never came. I asked for my check and I had to have it altered because they had charged me for the wine even though I never actually received it. All in all, it cost me $120 with tip. It was not much food and while it was tasty, I don't know if I would make it a habit to return.We went here last week with another couple. Most of the food was tasty but some weren't that great for me. It was loud and hard to hear the server, and the service was very slow.When I showed up in Vegas everyone had such a mixed review or thoughts about this place. It came down to the typical "its something you need to check out once and take it from there". Well thats about what happened as we headed out to Pure for a friends birthday.

First and foremost, we did have VIP passes and I was really disappointed at the cluster fuck of a "VIP" line. It was a straight up mess. Granted I do understand this is Vegas and this club is "one of the best" according to so many locals and people who've gone out around the town. However, it was a mess. 

Ladies: Don't bother to get in with VIP, they'll let you in for free in a separate line that actually is organized.

back to the VIP mode: 

As we waited for a good 45mins I notice the bouncers were pulling groups in on the VIP who agreed to buy a bottle. Ok, this is straight stupid. Granted you are on the VIP as it is but these dudes were basically hustling fools by saying "You'll get in faster if you buy a bottle". LOL fawk that. Fools were paying 300 plus for bottles of cheap Vodka, we are talking like Absolute. 

Well after watching a few people fall into the trap we actually were finally let in. It was about 12:30ish and this place was packed! We were trying to figure out the lay out of the club but to be honest we were  really dying for a drink. We made it up stairs where there is a nice outdoor roof top which over looks the strip. This is by far a super nice spot to chill and get away from all the cluster fuck, but to be honest, it was just as crowded if not more. We finally landed a drink after doing the Old School rave march, AKA running to the bar and being completely rude while doing it. It worked so fuck it.

Well all in all this place was just waaaaaay tooo packed but we did have a great time. 

Downsides:
Long Lines: (Both Bar and Entry)
Unable to hang out:  bouncers were constantly moving the crowd which got annoying when trying to just sit in one spot and chill
Handfuls of wanna be pimps
Handfuls of stuck up women

ok those last two are everywhere. LOL

Upsides:
Plenty of places to explore, if you are willing to fight the crowd.
Music; typical club wash (top 40's and old school hits)
Good Views outsides
Nice Decor
Good People


Overall it was not the "shit" like everyone was telling me. However it did also represent the whole "you have to go once!".

SO Average club with nice decor, decent music, and a sea of people. Yup that is pretty avg.PURE was okay. If you follow the secret insider tips then you'll have a better time than most others, so read carefully!

COVER: If you call the day of and ask to be put on the GUESTLIST, you don't have to pay cover. It's that simple. We were there on a Saturday night during the busy labor day weekend, and we all got on the guestlist, avoiding the huge charges!

LINES: Expect to wait 30 minutes to 2 hours... unless you're on the guestlist! We got in almost right away, and our guy to girl ratio was 3:2, which is why I was surprised that we got in.

DRINKS: The wait for drinks isn't too bad, especially because there are 3-4 bars in the 3-4 areas. Prices are slightly above standard. It was my friend's birthday, but they don't do any free drinks. 

I had a jagerbomb, lemon drop, buttery nipple, kamikaze, three wise men, liquid cocaine, and tried my friends' tokyo tea and washington apple. They were all stiff enough for my liking, and were made fairly quickly. Remember to tip!

CROWD: Hipsters, aged 25-33, with the occasional man or woman in their 40's or 50's. My friends and I were all 21 so we felt super young. It seems like all the youngins go to Tao when they come to Vegas. 

ROOMS: The rooms were all nice. Lots of lights and some Pussycat Dolls dancers. cooooool.

Overall a cool place if you're on the guest list.Pure was alot of fun, The line was extremely long, since it was myself and 3 other ladies, we pretty much skipped all of that and had been escorted right in. I was EXTREMELY excited to come here and maybe that's why this place did not meet all of my expectations.

The main room only played techno music, and that was really loud and annoying. It was extremely crowded and the crowd was all townies and strange.

I had been to Jet and Body English the 2 nights before, at which I had an amazing time and Pure was a bit annoying in comparison.

Hey, to each his own.Really don't know what the hype is about this place. I've seen much better all you can eat brunch places for similar or lesser price. 
Let me start with black caviar - it is not Beluga and as such it looks and tastes completely different and for those who never had black caviar before it would be an awful experience to try this caviar. Believe me I was born in Russia and know my black caviar :-).
Second most advertised thing for the buffet is lobster tails - well they were so dry that nor butter or lemon could bring them to life.
Hence, the two things I really wanted to attend this place for were awful. Without caviar and lobster tails this buffet should not cost more than $45 and we paid $90 for what the called "caviar" and supper dry lobster tails.I feel like this buffet is losing it's touch.

I can remember eating here a few years ago and I thought everything was so great!  The scrambled eggs were the best I'd ever tasted.  The milk, so fresh and cold!  Everything was so so so so good.

This time around, everything was still good.  But not the best.

I did enjoy that they put out salmon and tuna nigiri's for dinner time.Gorgeous eggs benedict, not best service((I am not as impressed as everyone else.  The sushi is my favorite here as I have yet to be disappointed with it.  I find the meats to be dry and any pasta rubbery.  Snow crabs legs are good and the king crab legs tasted too fishy.  It is really crowded so it is hard to see everything on the tables.  The desserts are merely ok and not delicious enough to be called desserts.  I got sick about 2 hours after eating here.  Wynn's buffet is better.This WAS the best buffet in Vegas many years back. The spacing is quite congested and not modern. Dinner price was $27.99 with a 10% discount if you're staying at Planet Hollywood. There were stations representing different ethnic areas, American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, Italian as well as a dessert and salad station. The good;  chicken curry, tandoori chicken, crab legs and fried chicken the mediocre; prime rib, desserts and the salads, the bad; minestrone soup, spring rolls and the fried shrimp. Pay a little more and go to Aria, Wynn, Bellaggio or Cosmopolitan.

WOULD I GO BACK? If I were staying at Planet Hollywood and too lazy to venture out.....yes.This place is just an average casino buffet that you can find everywhere. Nothing too bad and nothing too special.We had high expectations for this buffet because it was all our friends raved about. Although the selection was great, the food was mediocre (should that be expected in a buffet?)

The Buffet overall 
Our Rating (on a scale from 1-10; 10 being the best): 7

Ambiance/atmosphere: 6 - The atmosphere was okay. Lots of people and we sat in the corner, which was nice. However, it felt much like being in a cafeteria and that detracted a little from our experience.

Service: 5 - The waitress would come pick up our plates occassionally but with a large party they stacked up quickly. However, each time she came by, she was very friendly, as was the rest of the staff.

We havent been to many buffets in Vegas, but from what we've eaten this one was pretty good. 

Until next time!

-N & HTao...

I actually like this place for the dancing experience and the look of the place. It is impressive to look at and the music was really good. However one thing that got to me was the price of drinks seriously almost 30 bucks for two goose and tonics that are served in the tiniest glasses with way too much ice...Im sorry but for me that is a killer. 

I didn't wait in line long so I was happy and I tried to pay cover and the cashier just handed me back my cash so that was a win...the people here I reallly didnt pay much attention to, I could sense the douchebags and what not but came with awesome people to that is all that mattered. I had way more fun in the upper level that played house and dance music then i did in the RnB room...

In short its a nice looking club, good music, cool DJ's, Hot bartenders that rape your wallet and leave you sober though....Check it out if your a clubbin kinda person!I am giving this 3.5 stars and rounding down.

After Chef Bartolotta won the James Beard award for the Southwest I made a reservation here.

We started with some soft shell crabs and I was very disappointed.  I have had a lot of softshell crab recently because it is in season, but this one was not that good.  Not sure if it was the crab or the preparation but it was definitely not juicy like it should be and it was a little too crunchy.  

I ordered his "signature" ravioli and my companion ordered something like spaghetti with meat sauce (sorry I don't remember the name).  The ravioli was very, very rich. Too rich for me and I like rich foods.  The other pasta, however was excellent.  

Then the star of the meal and what they're famous for is the fish from the Mediterranean Sea which they bring in daily.  They offer a wide variety of fish, preparations, and sauces.  I went with the sea bream and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfectly executed and I really enjoyed the sauce with fresh tomatoes in it.  The tomatoes tasted like San Marzanos.

The service was pretty good.  Our main server was very helpful and knowledgeable but the other one who comes by to fill the water and other stuff was slow.  I was thirsty throughout the meal but couldn't figure out where she hid our water bottle.  

I can't remember if we got dessert.  Total bill for two was $250  (no alcohol).  I'll probably be going back - I wanna try more of their pasta.  Maybe I'll order it from the bar if that's allowed.I recently dined at Bartolotta during my stay at the Wynn this past weekend. We had scheduled a reservation well in advance and in spite of some of the reviews on the poor service I was very optimistic. 
It was beautifully decorated and the outside cabanas were gorgeous. We had a party of 8 and did not have to wait long for our table which was perfect. We were greeted right away by the somelier and presented with a 59 page binder of their wine list. The restaurant was extremely crowded and the entire dinner took more than 3 hours. There was such a long pause between the appetizer and main entree course that everyone was becomming wrestless and by the time the entree arrived everyone was just over it. My boyfriend and I ordered the Seafood Risotto and Ricotta Ravioli appetizers  which were fantastic! I then ordered an arugula salad with pancetta and balsamic vinegar. I thought it was so so and found the pancetta a bit tough.  Three of us decided to split the fish entree and had it served tableside with a lemon, olive oil and  garlic, marinade. Our waiter did a fabulous job deboning the fish and serving it to the three of us. This was probably one of the best points of our dinner.

I found this restaurant to be upscale Italian and not for everyone. I witnessed a party of 10 men come in, be seated, look at the menu and then get up to walk out. I did enjoy the food overall and had we not had such poor service I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars.There is a lot of restaurants all over Vegas and I have seen this place tons of times and decided to give it a try.  The setting is nice, but the beer selection is so so.  I wanted a Stella or NewCastle and had to settle for a corona.  They have lunch specials, I had the Lobster Bisque, which was ok, I have had better.  The crab cakes on the other hand was really good.  It's worth a try, but don't think I'd try again.The chili rubbed double ribeye is probably one of the more popular dishes on the menu at SW Steakhouse. It's huge, feeds 3 people (possibly more), is cooked well and has good flavor. But I can't bring myself to give SW more than 3 stars because I would rather save $106 and pay a little more for a simpler steak! I prefer my steak to be simple so I can taste the beef. The chili rubbed ribeye has a lot of spice which I think takes away from really enjoying the meat.

The beat salad here is very tasty, if you like beets. My favorite side dish is the truffle creamed corn. Delicious! The scallops and risotto are also a good choice. Definitely save room for dessert too. Last time I was here, I had the funnel cake (which everyone orders) and the warm sticky toffee pudding. The pudding is really good!!

Service at SW is great and everyone is very attentive, which they should be if you're spending that much for your dinner. It's also nice to be able to sit by the Wynn waterfall and watch the show that takes place every half hour. If I come back, I think I'll try a different steak so I can write a better review.I've been to a number of steakhouses in Las Vegas and none of them stand out - for the food. This place stood out for two things. First, the water show. Second, the prices. I have no qualms with paying exorbitant prices for outstanding food. I have a slight problem paying exorbitant prices for marginal food. This is marginal food.

The steaks were about as good as you can find at any other steakhouse. Some of the sides, appetizers and salads were above average. I think when you're spending $100+ per plate on dinner, it ought to be off the hook good. Not so at SW Steakhouse.

Slightly upturned face.Yummy spot; worth checking out, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune for dinner. 

It's a little tricky to get to from the main entrance of the hotel (meaning it's a jaunt). The food is prepared well and the restaurant gives off a fun and trendy vibe. One major drawback, we were seated near a really noisy group of about 20 people (the amount of tequila consumed by this table may have added to their noise level). It made it really difficult to carry on a conversation with the others at our table. 

Highly recommend the guacamole prepared table side!On our second work trip to the MGM, this was a new experience for me. 

Once we were seated, we ordered three batches of the guacamole (mild, medium, and hot). The hot was super good and I probably could have just eaten that all night. The salsas left nothing to be desired, but I believe I only tried 2/3 that they brought out. I do wish they would have refilled them during our meal though, since some people wanted to use them on their main courses. 

I heard good things about the tacos so I had the chicken taco plate. What came out was not what I was expecting, a HUGE platter with cheese and lettuce in one section, chicken in another, beans in another, and rice in the last. Plus a container of tortillas. What would have put this over the edge was well seasoned chicken, but it was just okay. Everyone else's meals looked good, and really my meal was not bad, just wished it had a little more kick. I'd probably try them againI'm always teetering between good and bad here.  Some trips I get perfectly done crepes, other trips I get some funky ones that make you wonder what you're eating.  It's come to the point that I have to watch them make the crepe and observe each step to ensure I get what i want.

There are times when the crepes get too thick, sometimes too thin.  A lot of the workers there like many in the restaurant industry, believe that more is always better.  that rule does not hold true for savory crepes.  I don't need an overload of sodium to my diet, so you can keep the extra sauce off, and no need for extra seasoning either.  The same goes for sweet tooth's.  Piling on a mountain of whipped cream or berry sauce isn't going to make my taste buds jump w/ joy and I really don't want to frequent my orthodontist often.

When I do happen to get a good crepe, it's heavenly.  I'm not too big on savory crepes, but I'll grab a bite here and there off someone else's if they get it.  Call me a sweet guy, cuz it's always about the berries, or chocolate when it comes to these wonderful desserts.Can I copy someone else's review?  I completely agree with Vivian.  This place is all about the view.  In fact, it's really about 3 things...

1) The view
2) Being able to brag to friends "I've been to the Ghost Bar"
3) The ride up the elevator

Other than that...eh.  First of all, the place was filthy.  The gray-ish carpet had stains all over it.  I don't know why, but that shocked me.  I remember thinking as I walked in "this is IT?".  I was actually convinced we were at the wrong bar.  The tables and chairs looked cheap and, along with the carpet and bad lighting...I was completely underwhelmed.

So, I spent my time outside.  The view was great.  And, of course, you gotta stand on the glass floor.  The angle of the walls actually kinda of did some tricks with my head for a minute, so it takes a while to get your bearing (at least, it did for me.  Or...was that the vodka?)

Anyway, been there...done that...probably won't go back.I actually have seen this show twice. The first ime was when it first debuted in Vegas some years ago. That was before a host of new Cirque shows pop up in LV. The first time I thought it was awesome...because I have not seen anyhting like it before. 

Recently, we went to see it again...this time I found it less entertaining. Maybe its because I have had a chance to see the newer Cirque shows like Ka. I will rate Ka way ahead of O for the wow factor. 

If you choose to go see O stay away from the corner sections...better to sit further back center than upfront to the sides. And no rain coats are not needed even if you choose a wet seat. Enjoy!The good: the chicken on my spinach salad was real chicken, not that reprocessed chicken nonsense, and the pecans were freshly candied. The dried cranberries weren't plumped, but I'll give them a pass, because the rest of the salad was better than I was expecting from a diner.

The bad: the soup of the day was terrible. It was a mix of chopped and diced veggies in chicken stock. It tasted like they literally just tossed some veggies in with chicken stock, and some salt and pepper. That would have been bad enough, but, it wasn't even a proper dice; the chunks were all different sizes, so the small ones cooked faster and were soggy, and the large ones were undercooked.

The ugly: I live in such a food wasteland that I'll probably end up eating here again.The note I left myself when drafting this review was "Portions" and that had to do primarily with huge difference in size between my Halibut (appetizer-ish) and Sam's Cioppino (would have fed two). I felt cheated. My Ahi Duo appetizer was a great start - lots of complementary flavors. Sam's White Shrimp cocktail was fresh and flavorful but basic. This was our first meal in Las Vegas for this trip and while acceptable, wasn't particularly memorable - oh, and Sam reminds me, he never got to order the glass of wine he'd wanted with his main course.Clean. Selection is limited but the quality beats many other buffet of buffet colleagues. Desserts are very good.This restaurant is by the same people that did China Grill but it lacks the same flair. I like the sandwiches at the cafe section.. I have to admit... but everything else seems a little weird..We went here because the lines for the buffet was waaaay long on Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m. and we had to get to the Moorea Beach Club before 11 a.m. to grab out cabana reservation.

Seated pretty quickly - decent waiter service (constant refills of water & coffee - checking to make sure our food was okay).  The waiter told us right at the beginning that all eggs would only be served scrambled due to the salmonella outbreaks that have been occurring in the States.

I ordered a lobster cobb salad.  It was GIANORMOUS!  I know it was over $20 but it was so worth it!  Delicious!

Other people had corned beef hash, American breakfast w/ steak, breakfast croissant sandwich, chicken noodle soup (this person wasn't hung over - he just eats like a bird), scrambled eggs with salmon...Nova something or other.

We all liked our food - it was just REALLY pricey.  But so was the buffet.Am I missing something here? There're are three grand lux cafe's on yelp? They all seem to be the same place though. Anyway, the food here is average, expensive (18 dollars for a simple salad with a little ahi tuna?? Seriously??). But the waiter we had was fast and efficient and checked frequently to make sure everything was okay. 

The place would be better if they would drop their prices to something more reasonable.Like most people have described, it is like the cheesecake factory. I would also give the cheesecake factory 3 stars for these same reasons (to help you gauge my scale here). I place a lot of weight on the food quality and taste at a restaurant (go figure). Unless the server were to throw food on me and break the plate over my head I wouldn't take away more than a star for service. That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.

If you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too. If you want a place that has ingredients that were never frozen and prefer a more natural and fresh taste, I think you will have to look elsewhere.***food review only***

i don't understand this place, i don't understand the menu, i don't understand the service, i don't understand why there isn't a daily special on sundays.

i always had the idea before i ever frequented it that the house of blues would be on par with hard rock cafe.  so naive.  it's not that the hard rock cafe is awful, it's that hob is a culinary trainwreck.  gordon ramsey would have a fit.

i think hob food can best be described as "down home southern cookin'" or something to that effect.  mac 'n cheese, jambalaya, rice and beans are all on the menu.  the menu is really extensive, and hob dabbles in a bit of everything apparently, but nothing on the menu looked good to me while i was here, and believe me that is saying something because i was STARVING and everything looks good to me when i'm starving.  i finally settled on the mixed field greens and a side of fries.  "unremarkable" is my verdict!  i had a few bites of my friend's mac 'n cheese...FAIL.  but that was to be expected, since emmy's spaghetti shack in san francisco has spoiled me for good in the mac 'n cheese department.One final update for their self proclaimed famous baby back Ribs. It was a good deal at $10.99 for happy Hour (3-7). You get a half-rack and some top-notch homemade coleslaw. Normally, the half rack is $15.99. Yes, the ribs do fall off the bone and if you put some of their excellent BBQ sauce (it comes unsauced and basically unseasoned) it turns into a three-star ribs. These were a bit fatty though and I'm not sure they were truly baby backs, but overall they were good, just nothing that would be worth ordering again. The bartenders are always friendly here and you get good service if it's not crowded and your not a regular. If it's crowded, forget it, unless you know one of these guys for years like most people do at Eli's.Good place to hang out and enjoy a bunch of drinks. There is Karaoke and a live band. Food is good not great - typical bar food. Service is friendly and quick.I am an overweight, middle-aged (39), light-drinking, middle-income generating male.  I fit right in here.   Need I say more?  

Ok, so maybe I do.  This place is full of middle-aged, overweight, boring looking folk.  This place needs a rope.  I probably wouldn't have made it in if there had been, without the slight advantage of arm candy or a wad of cash pressed firmly into the hand of the bouncer.  Anyways - drinks are $14 and a soda water cost us $5, I don't care, but some people do.  If you are one of them, you probably shouldn't be in here anyways.

The club scene in Las Vegas is under the gun at the moment and they let in just about anyone nowadays.  Gone are the days of exclusivity, style and class in lieu of the holy dollar.Dayum son, this place was literally a FIRE HAZARD!

Let me tell you how to get into a club first of all. http://wantickets.com/ 
Book mark that son! You don't need no stankin' promoter. Ladies you don't have to put out, fellas you don't have to dish out! Well let me rephrase that, you're going to need some type of debit/credit card for this site (my dude Alan Wong gave me that site, ladies he drives a Lexus!). We paid $30 and showed it to the people at Tryst. Didn't even have to wait! Anyway, go to that site, look for the venue (Tryst in this case), pre-pay that shit, charge it to the game (the game charges a lot in APR though), and vwallah! up in that bieeetch like VIP!

To start off, we went here on New Year's weekend, so I was expecting it to be packed, but no to the point where if someone fell in the club, they would get stomped to death (didn't happen, but could have!). AFROJACK was playing here so I guess everyone was all hyped and shit when they hear that PEW, PEW music. Come to think of it, it was more like AFROPACKED cuz no one could move. Shit son, the freakin' Samoan bouncer dude was blocking people from entering the dance floor at midnight or so! Little did he know his big ass was taking up 5 spaces himself! I shouldn't be taking it out on the Samoan one in particular cuz the Bouncers didn't do anything but take up space at all...

ON this night Tryst should have been called THIRST**, cuz there were some thirsty ass people here, men and women alike. I'm talkin' errybody's throats was hurtin' thirst. Ladies was lookin' right though. Everyone was real receptive this night. Matter of fact, I'll go as far as to say this place had an "STD" Rating of 5 out of 5. It was real +POSITIVE+ up in there. The mood and people alike. How do I know? Cuz when I was on the dance floor, and the hairs on my harm and neck stood up.

Let me talk about the club real quick. Right when you walk in, there's a GIGANTIC-ASS waterfall, makes it look all nice. Just don't go chasing waterfalls, TLC told me that. Drinks was hella expensive too. 3 AMF's cost like $55. That had me saying F8CK you Afrojack all night...

On some real shitttt, how come everytime they get some famous ass dude in a club, drink prices sky rocket!??? I didn't even get to see Afrojack, dude was performing at the end. I thought it was some young DJ the whole night that was Afrojack until they said, ya'll ready for Afrojack???? Then everybody (especially the white people) went crazy! Matter of fact, I Google Imaged Afrojack and I still don't know wtf he looks like...

someone help me!!! 

I do like this place though, just needed to be less crowded. To me it felt like they just let as many people in as they could.

**THIRST = REAL, REAL DESPERATEthey serve revolution roast from just coffee, which is fine by me. 50 cent refills, but bring cash (they dont take credit cards). i had a pumpkin and carrot muffin which was topped with delicious and satisfying crunchy pumpkin seeds. actually i split the muffin with compadre. we also split a cup of coffee. i have got to remember to get cash before i go there (the chase bank across the street charges a THREE DOLLAR service fee to use the ATM). anyway, i like the wooden booths, the tables are spread out nicely. certain members of the staff are a little on the foggy side.Nice atmosphere, but, for the price, the sushi is very average. The sashimi cuts are thick, cold, and chewy. The food presentation is beautiful, the staff attentive, and some of the rolls are tasty, but if I'm in Vegas and want good sushi, I just hold on until I can get back to LA.This restaurant specializes in both paella and tapas.  We started off with a salad of apples, almonds, manchego cheese over organic greens (4), baked goat cheese in a rich tomato sauce (3.5) and dates wrapped in bacon (1.5).  We were disappointed by the dates which were overcooked and chewy.  I questioned the waiter and he confirmed that this is the way the dish is prepared.  We also ordered paella; mine was mixed seafood with shrimp, scallops, mussels and green beans.  Ann ordered the evening's special seafood paella with monkfish, beans and squash.  Each was visually unappealing suffering from a heavy hand with the tomato sauce and an absence of saffron.  I used a $50 certificate purchased form a radio station.Omg, It was Last Thursday April 16,2009. The Hostess behind the booth got the Biggest BOOB JOB of all. My wife was next to me and she also saw her too. Lucky she wasnt mad about that. HAHAHA!!!!! Thats a reason why there was alot of guys there than ladies. 

The price is fair comparing to other hotels that charge more. Average price range about $15 including drinks. Food is ok but the guacamole is the only thing that taste good.3.5-4 stars

While waiting for the rest of our group to arrive in Vegas, the boy, my best friend and I decided to grab some dinner. At 9 p.m. the place was packed but we were seated after waiting a few minutes.

Our server was really nice but took awhile to take our drink and food orders. My friend was checking-in and I went with her to find her room and help her get settled. 15-20 minutes later and they still hadn't taken our order! They did give us chips and 3 different kinds of salsa - pico de gallo, tomatillo, and salsa verde. Anyway, here's what we ordered:

-Regular Mojito's
-Grilled Steak Quesadillas
-Tacos Baja
-Isla Rice & Refried Beans

The mojito's were okay - they were a little too sweet for my taste. They also came in a smaller glass so you couldn't really see all the fresh ingredients. I had the steak quesadillas and I thought they were okay, a little on the dry side but that was easily fixed with adding some of the salsa on top. I had a bite of the tacos baja, or fish tacos, and they were really good - I wish I had ordered those! The side of rice and beans was pretty basic but really good when paired with the tacos. 

This is another great option inside Treasure Island to grab some dinner. It's also really nice and dimly-lit inside so you kind of forget that you're in a casino.Who knew there would be more sushi restaurants in Phoenix than there are Starbucks in Seattle!  
Plates of pasta and carbo loading for races are totally passe.   The perfect balance of protein and starch was what we were all craving before the PF Chang Rock N Roll Half Marathon.  
Blue Wasabi was solid - the decor was  a little outdated and the drinks kinda fruity and corny, but the service was very friendly and the sushi was very good.  They had several intersting rolls, and the unagi was delicious (a good measure of the quality of a sushi joint, in my opinion)  
We left pleasantly full, but not stuffed, and perfectly satisfied.Man... what happened?

My wife and I felt pretty bad, after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks, only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter. We were the only two in our group who had been there before, and luckily the only ones embarrassed when things did not go as smoothly as we would've hoped.

Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch, as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello... But the service just fell off, due to one person in particular. Read Nader A's review for the full story, but the gist of it is there was a (rude) miscommunication on the waiter's part, and he was so steadfast (attitude) about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received. He also chose to do this at peak volume coinciding with the entertainer's break, so not only did everyone at our table get an earful, but so did the surrounding patrons. it was like a scene in a movie when a bunch of people who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needle scratches right off the record. To Nader A's credit, he remained cool, but the damage was done. Later on we found out that our waiter also dissuaded others at the table from customizing their pizzas because "they are perfect the way they are." I don't know if he had something else going on and decided to take it out on us, but to snap at us the way he did was truly unacceptable.

We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert, and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well, but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere. Will we be back? Eventually, but in all honesty not anytime soon, and definitely not in that guy's section.

I in no way would dissuade anyone from trying out Cibo. They excel at what they do, and my experience was most likely out of the ordinary.I've been to Fez several times but it is more for convenience than great food. Their food leans towards Mediterranean but their menu does offer other items as well. One note - check out their late night happy hour. I think it starts at ten.The food was delicious and I would've given Seablue 4 stars however the kitchen forgot our side dishes and our server kept forgetting to refill out water glasses after she offered and we asked.  

A friend and I had the surf and turf special which was $60 per person for a porterhouse, half a lobster and king crab legs.  The lobster was a tad overcooked, but everything else was delicious.  I also had a lobster poptart, yum!  But anything with puff pastry is yum...The rest of the table had oysters, tuna carpaccio, the clam chowder fondue (which was too salty), onion rings (not worth $10), fish and chips and the burger.  We also ordered two sides of the truffled mac and cheese, but those never came out.  It was kind of good that we didn't get them because the surf and turf special was really filling.Crowded with lots of youngins, bartender seemed a but rude and full of himself, oh and there's a fog machine on the dance floor. It's very "club-y" not to say it isn't fun, I did have a good time here but it wouldn't be number 1 on my list.I didn't try the chocolates so my review is just for the paninis and macaron. 

I had the sweet basil chicken and chicken tandoori sandwiches. Both were good but the basil one was really good. Greasy though, as most paninis are. 

Macarons were good. 

Really pricey for what it all is, but I guess that's how it is in Vegas.Located just past the lobby and lines for Haze. We had visited the Bellagio location the night before and this location was faster, but the creeps were not as good. The strawberries were sour, the whip cream was completely without taste and the style of crepe building was different. The crepe was entirely folded before any garnishing was added. Very little Nutella or chocolate in comparison to the Bellagio location's crepes.  The crepe maker was also less than friendly. Go to the Bellagio location just past the Conservancy.For dinner, there is a wide selection with soups, salads, seafood ceviche, pizzas, italian dishes (ravioli, gnocchi, red sauce pasta, italian sausage), pasta bar, pork chops, carved turkey, lamb chops, prime rib, Asian station, sushi station, Indian station, cocktail shimp, kng crab legs, and dessert bar. I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

The prime rib was pretty bloody, it was done like rare to medium rare. The king crab legs were very SALTY and some legs had ice crystals in it still. They probably make it salty on purpose so you drink a bunch of water and get full. Hey, they still gotta run a business, right? Compared to the  Bellagio, Wynn dessert bar was disappointing. The selection was not a big, the homemade vanilla ice cream was flavorless, and worst of all, the crepe station SUCKED! The crepe was all doughy, the fillings selection sucks, and they don't even have nutella. Also, the only fresh fruits served were honey dew, cantalope, and watermelon. They had strawberries, pears, pineapple, and lychee, but all were soaked in syrups. 

For the price, I don't think I would come here again.This place is just alright. I mean for the 39.99 holiday meal it should have been better. Its was like you went in there and your like "that's it". Yeah some of the food I ate was great and I got seconds, but worth the 39.99 I don't think so. At the time though I had to tell myself it was worth it cos I was in denial. They do have some nice gimmicks though. Like the crepe station and the ice cream thing. Aladdin pre-Planet Hollywood had a better buffet than Wynn, no offense. When I got to the dessert area I was like WTF this is it. I don't even remeber if they had carrot cake which is one of my requirements for a good buffet. I think I ate it but I don't remeber cos I guess I couldn't get over the fact of the $39.99. Only place I can really compare it too is Bellagio which I think is much better on many different levels. Ok if they charge like $29.99 I would have given it an extra star. Haha and I thought the holiday $26.99 meal at the Mandalay was pricey. That doesn't even compare. Oh and you can't really compare the whole king crab leg thing anymore. Most hotels have the king crab legs. I wonder if going to Vegas on some presidents day is a holiday.After reading all the glowing reviews that said the Wynn has the best brunch in Vegas, we stopped in this past Sunday around noon.  The place was packed and the line to get in was long.  I took this all as a good sign.  However, when we saw the food, which was displayed beautifully, I was underwhelmed by the selection.  There were no crab legs, no lobster tails.  Really, the only seafood was shrimp cocktail--which was nothing special--and baked salmon (the citrus beurre blanc was nice) and red snapper.  I expected a lot more in the way of seafood options and was disappointed--especially since I don't eat red meat.  Pics I've seen online all showed the Wynn brunch with giant crab legs and lobster, but there was definitely none to be had on 1/27/13 when I was there.  The dessert options were also underwhelming.  The cream puffs were splendid, but the raspberry cheesecake shooters tasted like Jello no-bake and all the chocolate cakes were sugar-free.  Very disappointing.  So, five stars for presentation and service, but three stars for the food.I'm basing my three star review on the service and the variety of non-meat options on the menu.  The food itself only earns two stars, in my opinion.  We tried the chips and salsa as well as a variety of tacos and sides.  Apparently, the only way they know how to add flavor is to add more salt.  The chips, salsa and sweet potato fries were way, way too salty, but the tacos lacked any flavor.  The various taco fillings were dry and bland.  Compared to other Madison tex-mex restaurants (El Dorado or Pasqual's) T Tubb's is definitely last on my list.

Their menu has a lot of variety, but maybe they need to slim it down and perfect some of the basics.  Their service was outstanding though!  Our waiter was pleasant and efficient.Well, I was here for traffic school, so I wasn't exactly excited to arrive at 7:45 AM on a Saturday morning. There were signs up and it was easy to find the conference room. The room is plain as are the chairs. Basic, minimal set-up. No frills.  It was a little chilly in the room, but that is better than being hot and stuffy.  The bathrooms were close and clean.  You can tell the hotel has been around for a while, but from what I can tell, they make the best of what they have.  With that being said, I would like to remind you (the reader) that I have not seen the inside of one of the Grace Inn's hotel rooms in over 5 years.My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for over three years now and we still love the food...I wish I could say the same about the service.  More and more frequently we have experienced absolutely horrible service.  Ranging anywhere from inattentive service to incorrect orders being served and more often less than hot.  The thing that has prompted me to finally write this though was my family's most recent visit.  Some twenty plus minutes after we ordered, I had to alert the waitress to the fact that we still not been served any of our meals (even my son's salad), while the table behind us who had arrived 5-10 minutes after that had already received there second helping of all you can eat wings.  There didn't seem to be any real reason for this since the restaurant was fairly empty (it was before 6:00pm),  We soon got our food (my son getting about a minute for his salad before our entrees came), but there was no explanation of what happened or even an apology for what happened and the food was lukewarm to boot (even though the waitress cautioned my son about how "hot' his plate was). 

I know not all the staff is so inattentive, but honestly it seems to be getting worse and worse over time.  If we could get the menu items elsewhere we likely would never return to this location...And yes, I plan on completing the 'survey' on their receipt with this same narrative!Our 1st trip to Vegas, with fine dining key on our list, we made a res at Michael Mina.  Was a disappointment, food was good but not excellent, and service was well below average.  When asked if we had somewhere to be next, we said no, but felt highly rushed nonetheless.  

Dishes came out so quickly, but couldn't get our waiter's attention for cocktails.  The fluke crudo was good, lobster pot pie was good (tho guessing execution could vary).  Have to say, if you're MP is always $85 for the lobster pot pie, just put the price on the menu.  

Felt like this place is trying to play in a league it's not able to deliver in.  Good meal, but not at that price point.  Mediocre atmosphere, nothing special.Cute cafe for quick bite. Don't set expectations high. Quality of food is similar to microwaveable and/or vending machine food. Prices are average being located at Wynn. Bagel with cream cheese and a toasted-microwaved breakfast bagel (pre-made) 2 small coffees and a half cup of fruit $25. Stop by if drunk and hungry no where else to go during late hours.The place is awesome in that it's the only nice place around open 24/7 and very conveniently located next to the elevator. The bad, SO overpriced! The food was good, but not amazing nor worth the price. But hey when you're tired/drunk, it'll do wonderfully! Staff isn't very attentive either...So my new boss and friend invited me out here for an event. I missed the limo ride unfortunately boo, so no red carpet for me. He did a "Garden of Eden" photo shoot here and I basically just observed the whole process. It was so SIIIIK they even brought in a snake for some of the pics. It was the coolest thing ever. Bathing suits and hot chiks for a shoot nuff said!!

 So I guess there is no cover here?? That's cool since its a pretty small place and from what I heard it wasn't even as packed in as usual. Drinks are the normal Scottsdale price. There are 3 stalls for the bathroom and only 2 of them worked last night. Oh all the Princess' need to learn how to wash their hands.....gross! Cochinas!!

I wouldn't mind doing VIP here again.I love the Maggiano's in my home town, so I thought why not in vegas!? It's right across from my hotel and I know the food is awesome.

Everything was great until we walked back to our hotel and took a nap. We all woke up feeling super sick. 

But lemme talk about the actual experience in the restaurant. It was a super long wait for 5pm but we got hooked up and passed the line. We were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner. The food was the same as always and it wasn't better or worse than any other Maggiano's I've been to except for the part where we all got sick. 

Oh well.Wow. Buffet style dining is not normally my favorite thing to do, but Wow.  A champagne brunch will cost you $25 dollars a person, but our hungry, hungover group of 6 packed away WAY more than that per person. I'm amazed at the amount of food that they had, and even more surprised that it tasted pretty good.  I think the problem with buffets is that they often use poor quality ingredients to make food en mass, but this stuff was quite decent.  They had all sorts of food, dim sum, Mexican, a carving station, breakfast station, salad station, dessert station, sushi and more!  I didn't have any, but I heard the crab legs and smoked salmon were delectable.  The highlight for me was the dim sum, great shrimp dumplings and egg rolls. We all had mimosas, but they're made with cheap champagne.  The service was also kind of slow.  We got there around 12:30 and didn't have to wait long to be seated, but as we were leaving the lines had grown VERY long.  Bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed.  We finished up around 2pm and didn't eat the rest of the day from being so stuffed. :)i was once again clicking over whether or not to give this buffet 3 or 4 stars...am i really a fan?  or was it just a-ok?  so the deciding factor?  well, sad...really...the best buffet on the strip is actually inside the rio...but it happens to be the village seafood buffet...not the carnival world buffet.  

honestly, we were trying to save a few bucks because of a week's worth of buffet/fine dining venturing in vegas...i made a big mistake!  i should've spent the extra 10 bucks to walk across the casino to the other buffet.  oh well...no regrets right?  haha.  don't get me wrong...this buffet wasn't too shabby.  but if the best item here happens to be their pizza...then yes, that's probably not worth my money.  there wasn't a big ole seafood selection...the carved meats were typical...the dessert bar was plentiful...but nothing was really mind boggling.  yes, the quality was much higher than most of the buffets on the strip...but just didn't have that wow factor.  i wasn't too disappointed though...oh the joys of having that 24 hour buffet pass...

oh wow!  that just triggered a thought...the person at the register was such a #*%$#@&((*+@(!  we waited in line for a good half hour in order to purchase our 24 hour buffet pass...when we got there, she asked for my harrah's card...wth...i didn't have my harrah's card on me.  and i wasn't about to leave and stand in line again.  i asked her if i could put that bracelet on for now and have it exchanged after i retrieved my card.  she said no.  just flat out plain simple no.  and then she went on to say that if i tried to slip it on or off they will know and they won't accept it.  *yeah right!!!*  oh, and there's even more stink to this story...she failed to tell me that it costs 5 bucks more without a card...stupid bees knees.  anyhoo, i got it exchanged when i went to planet hollywood...so i'm flat out saying that she lied!

ok i'm done venting...so if you want a great buffet...don't be cheap and eat at the seafood buffet...and if you feel like having the best buffet in vegas...go to the m resort off the strip!!!Is it worth the money? If you eat a lot of crab legs :) Everything else? A-OK for quantity, but MEH for quality.I just want to preface this review by saying I ate at this buffet prior to reading about the cockroach problem outlined by a previous poster. LOL. 
This knocked my 4 star rating down to 3 stars. 

I actually had a great experience at this place and loved the food selections and variety. My husband and I purchased bracelets as part of the "Buffet of Buffets" tour. Of all the buffets on the tour, this one was the best. Really I should say it was the best of the worst. LOL. 

One thing I don't understand is the cold crab legs. I am from the East Coast (Maine) and we only serve crab legs steaming hot. Every place I went in Vegas was serving them cold. This must be an East coast/West coast thing. I suppose at a buffet type of place might run the risk of overcooking the legs and making them tough. 

Personally I prefer my crab legs warm as the crab flavors are much more enhanced when heated. Honestry I was a little hesitant to try crab at any of the buffets we went to in Vegas because many of the crab stations did not appear to be heated or cooled properly. The Rio appeared to be an exception to this.A little more noisy than I would prefer.  The gazpacho/watermelon soup was wonderful, the brussel sprout salad was sub par.  Good service.  They seem to be flourishing.Overrated, overrated, overrated.

The food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.

After waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. 

The food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.Every girl I know that lives in Phoenix ranks this place as one of her Top Five lunch spots around, but I'm still not sold on it. Sure, now and again I'll want to have a lighter, healthier lunch (something other than a burrito - I like to mix it up) and Sauce is good for that. But I feel like it tries to be upscale without actually being upscale, and casual without actually being casual either. It's in that strange netherworld where you're not sure if you're overdressed or overly caj, overfed or underserved, overpaying or overexpecting. 

The thin crust pizzas are actually really good, but light, so if you have a serious appetite don't be surprised if it don't need a box to take home extra slices. The house pizzas have interesting topping blends like artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes (err . . . maybe that's not that interesting. What can I say? I like heavy things with meat on them that you can empty entire jars of parmesan cheese onto. Any deviation from dense cheese and meat is "interesting" to me). 

They bring your food to your table (Pei Wei style) with one piece of packaged bread. This also slightly irks me. The bread is really good but they can't spring for baskets? If you're looking for New York style pizza that drips with cheese and thick pepperoni pieces, Sauce isn't your spot. For a light afternoon lunch or snack and a glass of wine, it gets the job done.Le Reve was an okay show, but the decor itself is breathtaking from beginning to end.  I agree with Misti Y--I think there are those will love Cirque shows and not this show, but that's a whole other talk post.

Breathtaking scenery but a story line that isn't that entertaining is what this show is made of, in my opinion.  The stage actually had malfunctions the night I went, so it wasn't easy to stay into the show when things broke down all night long.  Although the idea is beautiful, it didn't carry over into real life well.

Despite it's lack of true flair that it strives to steal from the Cirque shows, it's a nice try and something you may want to see just to see the beautiful theater, otherwise you may want to use that money toward another show.Sat in the front row, Got wet and watched a pretty cool show. Its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout. Worth the watch but definately not for the money. Seen better for less.I will give this show the benefit of the doubt because I wasn't really feeling well when I saw it (Think 2.5 days of drinking in the Vegas sun) but I may have dozed off a number of times watching it. 

Best show in Vegas? Nah. I've seen plenty of Cirque shows in NY that were 10x better. The visuals were great at frst  but  how many times can I watch people dive into a pool? Boring. There was no storyline. 

Sure the seating arrangements were great(Not a bad seat in the house) and I've never seen a submerged stage before but it got boring after the first half hour. 

Should've seen The Beatles show instead.Just an FYI everyone.  There is no "new owner" of Lisa G's.  There is a new restaurateur that bought the equipment and inventory at that location.  What is the difference?  He did not pay for the name, menu or assume debt.  This includes her gift certificates.  To ask a new business owner to honor them at a 100% loss is a little much.  This is one of the toughest industries at one of the toughest times.  I am not affiliated with either just wanted to put in an impartial word.  Thanks for reading :)I loved the old menu, but the changes gave me a change of heart. They had the best sandwiches & it was always quiet from 5 until 8 so you could sit & eat. The new menu is okay & we liked what we got, but we would've left if it wasn't happy hour. Even though the servings are big(maybe too big) the prices are retarded now. The buffalo chicken tenders were pretty good, but perhaps too spicy in the wrong way. I used to go & send people all the time, but without those yummy sandwiches & with the higher prices, we prolly won't make it back again. The servers usually are slow & fairly unattentive, but the menu was bringing us back.   :(    sad to see it change that way.Had a late lunch here last week with family during ASU graduation week.  We started with the boneless chicken wings in both "hot" and "bbq", and both were really tasty...obviously not really "wings" since they were meaty chunks and big...probably breasts. Which is awesome since I haet picking the tiny bits of meat of most places wings.  (They do offer wings with bones as well).  The Baja chicken sandwiches were a hit, and you can also get them as a wrap.  The nachos were average.The grilled cheese was the only thing that wasn't acceptable - bread too thick, not enough cheese. This is definitely a college town bar and grill, with prices appropriate for students, and pitchers of fun concoctions - many with flavored vodka and red bull. the staff is friendly and the environment is definitely casual and young.  I like the roll-up front "garage"-style door so you can eat/drink outside, and be art of the scene that is walking by.  really open and airy, and they keep the air-conditioning on so it's not stifling hot. If I were still in my 20's, this would probably be on my regular stomping ground list.I usually get comp rooms at the Venetian/Palazzo so I typically gamble long hours at these 2 places. I have eaten at Noodles Asia a few times due to it being a chinese restaurant and also getting comped food from the pit boss. 

First time I asked for a comp for 2, pit boss told me that I had $86 to blow at Noodles Asia. I was floored! I never eaten here before and was wondering how 2 people can spend $86 in a chinese restaurant, when we did not plan on ordering Shark's Fin, Abalone, Bird's Nest, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, Sea Cucumber, you know the drill. 

But Yes We Can, at Noodles Asia apparently. The food isn't great, heck, I would go to Ping Pang Pong over at Gold Coast over this place anyday. But I absolutely adore the fact that they have Chicken Mushroom Ginger Soup. Oh this is the reason why I go there. The rest are just for formality. Dim dum mediocre, Fried Rice Oily, Noodles not asian enough. 

In fact, last Saturday, I got drunk playing Baccarat at MGM HL room and got back to the Venetian and decided to have one bowl of soup. Sure it costs $10.95, sure it's still not that good, but it is to me the best item on this menu, and that is good enough reason for me to keep coming back.

For better dim sum and chinese food in general, head over to Bellagio's Noodles if you want a casino setting, or Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast. Otherwise head over to ChinatownI had comps from Sahara so I gave their buffet a try.  Overall it is a reasonable value for the money but with a big warning.

The Sunday brunch has prime rib, cold crab and shrimp and decent variety for additional dishes such as potatoes, rice, string beans, etc.  The prime rib was more rare than is typical at buffets which usually serve medium done prime rib.  It was pretty good quality.

The carving station also had turkey and ham.  The ham was very good as well but I didn't try the turkey.  The crab was a bit on the small side as were the shrimp.  I couldn't find hot butter and the cocktail sauce was alright.

A major weakness was the lack of desserts.  They only had about 8 or so choices.  Nothing looked very good.  Almost every other buffet in Vegas has choices of pies and cakes and often ice cream or gelato.  Not here.

Some of the lesser dishes were duplicated in identical lines to better serve a big crowd but it wasn't extremely busy.  I would have preferred more unique dishes but if it does get crowded an identical line would speed things up.  They were set up for an additional serving line but it wasn't be used this past Sunday morning.

The major caveat here is that it is very dimly lit and looks dirty.  Not from the plates which are face down as they should be or the serving stations but the decor.  I'm not sure how old it is but I wouldn't be surprised if it has never been remodeled.  This detracts from the buffet more than one would think.

One of the reasons why the buffet is cheaper than typical is beause there is much less service.  You get your own drinks and bussers don'[t come around that often--perhaps because there so few of them.

The cost including tax was $13.24 and it includes the cold seafood and champagne from a cart operated at the left of the buffet.  A beer is $3.00 extra.  The champagne was semi-secco and probably pretty cheap but I couldn't see the labels.  It was served in a plastic clear cup.

Overall, it is okay for the money but probably just if you are in the casino.  I wouldn't go out of the way for it and if I didn't have a $10 comp, I would not have eaten there in the first place.I have a streak of white trash in me that's a mile wide. That's my only explanation for being so curious about the various Prime Rib specials that you would see on the marquees on the more downscale casino halls on and off the Strip. I've always wondered if I had the potential to become a boozy, loud-mouthed gambler who would think nothing of eating a $4.99 plate of rare meat at 3AM. 

Well, I had to settle for eating here for lunch before boarding my plane back home to San Francisco. The price at a reasonable dining hour is $14.95 - since I assume the owners think you're too sober to judge the price too strictly. Bill's is meant to look like a Barbary Coast gambling hall, so the Victorian Room couldn't be anything but red naugahyde booths and faux-walnut walls. I think it's a stitch that half the menu is meat and potatoes and the other half is a Chinese buffet selection. 

Naturally I went for a slab of their prime rib, which was blood-rare, no questions asked. It came with a bowl of fluffed-up butter, a bowl of au jus sauce, and a small baked potato dwarfed by two containers of sour cream. Oh but first were the house salad, iceberg lettuce and croutons covered liberally with a ranch dressing, and a roll with a couple of pats of frozen butter. Yeah I ate it all. I ain't proud I did, but hell, it's Vegas. What I eat in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? 

FOOD - 3 stars...finally tried a prime rib special...and I guess quality does matter 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...the golden days of San Francisco reinvented in formica and naugahyde 
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...they served us, yes that's true 
TOTAL - 3 stars...a culinary outlet for my white trash needsWe had a coupon here so hit it up for breakfast.

Nothing super fancy, and like all things in Sin City-there was a bit of a wait to get in.

We just went with breakfast basics like pancakes and omlettes, but they were filling and just the kind of greasy spoon fare that we needed after a late night out in Vegas.

Not necessarily a place I will deliberately seek out on future visits, but a place I will certainly hit up if it is convenient to where we're staying...I would give a 2 stars because " meh. ive experienced better." was what I was thinking! but... I think I will settle for a 3 star since the man said it should be a 4 star. ..obviously he is a fan of the graveyard special 4.99 for a whole mess of yumminess! haha but anyway.. this place works I guess... not going to urge anyone to try it.. not going to turn anyone away either... Denny's is the best I can compare this place... except Denny's employees actually know how to work a cash register.. the older hostess had some problems....I recommend the Thai soup and congee.  The yellow noodle with duck and wonton soup were pretty bland. I had to mix in soy sauce and hot sauce to give it more flavor. Service can be very rude here sometimes. I recommend phoning your order, picking up your order to avoid the line, and eating in your room.Perhaps I ordered the wrong items?

We started with the "shabu-shabu" and what we got was a small bowl with one piece of shrimp, some veggies, and a tiny bundle of noodles. The broth was then poured into the bowl, tableside. Such false advertising to advertise this as shabu-shabu..it was more like a bowl of noodles. The flavor was bland and I truly think this dish should be taken off the menu.

My boyfriend ordered the Fleur Burger and I ordered the Short Ribs. The short ribs was a bit hard to pull apart/cut and the quality of the meat fell short of my expectations. I probably ate about half of it before throwing in the towel. I was excited to taste the Fleur Burger after hearing so many good things about it..but I just wasn't blown away.

The whole meal was so average..everything from the service to the food. My experience at Fleur has pushed Hubert Keller's other restaurants way down on my list of restaurants to try.our hotel (ballys)  recommended it..

 the restaurant is 'fancy,' has a romantic mood: dim lighting & candles, and also a nice little view.  the waiters were more than willing to serve us, they were so friendly (maybe TOO friendly, they were like flirting with us, it was sometimes uncomfortable).  they all seemed to be "italian."  but my friends and i are pretty sure that some of them were faking the italian accent. (haha)

 we all ordered different pasta dishes.  i ordered from their "specials for the night" : mushroom and black truffle ravioli..which i couldn't finish, not because there was too much on my plate but because the black truffle was "how do you say," too rich.
also my dish cost $50.00.

overall, the food was OKAY, the service was more than great, because they gave us free shots of GRAPPA and LEMON CELLO!!

atmosphere is for couples.  we all had a good time at Il Mulino because the waiters were entertaining us, but other than that.. i don't think I would go back there or recommend it.I have THREE words for you: spam & eggs. 

Yup, they serve that here. For those of you who know what's up...THAT'S what's up. It's damn expensive, but hey, you are in Vegas after all. And that whore will take you for all you're worth. 

But at least you can still have your comfort foods or alcohol absorbing delicacies 'round the clock!I wish this had more walking space. I hate feeling crowded and moving for everyone walking by. The stores are decent. I only really checked out NIKE and new balance(which sucks for selection)

I'd say worth the trip if you like other stores, theres other places to shop in vegas.Parking is a nightmare here...good luck!My man and I went to Padre's for dins and I had a groupon. I showed it to the guy who seated us who I assumed to be the manager(?) and he made a comment that sounded to the two of us like "great (not thrilled), another groupon(smirk)". This started us discussing why they would even offer a groupon if they weren't thrilled about people using them!?!? 
Whatevs- Chico was our server and I really liked him. We ordered chips and salsa and a lobster quesadilla to start since I had $50 to spend! CnS? Fine, not amazing, not bad. Lobster 'dilla- weird. I didn't really like the mango-lobster combo and I found a couple pieces of shell which felt really great on my chompers.
For dinner I had the stuffed chicken "house specialty" and JD got the salmon spinach enchilada's. Mine was good, not great and a little bit tough but nothing like JD's. I am a salmon lover through and through but once that enchilada entered my mouth I wanted it out ASAP. Blech! Boo! Yick! I actually wiped my tongue with my napkin (so ladylike, i know). It  really was repulsive. He ate most of it though, but didn't feel so good later. I don't think it was spoiled or anything- just REALLLY fishy in a bad bad way. 
So a couple of things left a bad tasted in my mouth (literally and figuratively). But I can't say enough good things about Chico. He made the experience good just by being a nice guy and a stealth server. 
The jury is out on whether I'd go back. I'm always in that area but not much impressed me food-wise. Might be fun to drink and hang out though.Here is one of my shorter reviews!  (For those of you who may feel that my reviews just simply keeps going and going and going.....) I do apologize for being so lengthy but I guess I just yelp too much...

Raffles Cafe... located in Mandalay Bay, was the spot that we decided to catch a late one after missing out on dinner buffets.... by the time we were hungry enough to eat, it's already 9:45pm so we had to settle for cafe instead.

Our party ordered 2 dishes since we were too hungry (had a nice buffet at lunch!)  

1) Fried Chicken with Veggies 
2) Strawberry Pancake

The serving was decent... Had 4 pieces of fried chicken (which were fried to perfection with lots of crunch and resistance to it...) Then steam veggies because we were trying to healthy!  LOL!  

Strawberry pancakes were ok, had some (not a lot) of fresh strawberries but not enough for the portion served. 

The theme was suppose to be a replacement of Roscoe's chicken & waffles, but instead, it's Henry's Chicken and strawberry pancakes.  With a combination of pancake, lightly covered butter spread, cruncy chicken on top it's actually pretty good!  

The cost came out to be  around $40 with Tax and Tip.... pretty steep for 2 dishes at a cafe in Vegas!  Oh well, it's Vegas right?  Let's hope those slots will help me out in the near future!

Service was decent.... not the greatest but ok..... The atmosphere was real nice though.

Parting note... the next day we had the Bayside buffet and realized that they served the same chicken...... hmmmm.... hope they were leftovers from the buffet because it's around their closing time.... the chicken sure came out pretty quick being so crunchy and all.......

I think I'll pass in the future and give the good old Bellagio cafe a go instead in the future since it cost about the same......I would give the food one star, but I have to up it to 3 stars purely for comedic reasons.  

So, we came here at like 2am one night this last weekend and proceeded to order some odd items.  

Little did we know that they would take our odd orders and come right back and make it a millions times odder!  I don't think I've laughed this much during a meal in a LONG time. 

I LIKE!

So, I had just eaten "dinner" a couple hours earlier, so I went for something light.  Cereal seemed like a safe choice.  They had some terrible choices (Cheerios, Cornflakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran, not good options!), and I figured cornflakes was probably the least offending out of all of those choices.  My other friends ordered toast and blintzes.  

So, already it's like, yeah, that's some terrible and odd food choices we made right there.

Anyway.  We order, and then begins the oddness.

First up, the pickles.  We're sitting there, being silly animals as usual, and then the waitress comes by with 6 large pickles and just plops them on our table.  

. . .

I like pickles too, but something about seeing nothing on the table but pickles made the situation really funny.  We started laughing.

And then it never stopped because here comes more:

Our food comes.  They give me my cereal on a PLATE with the milk in some sort of large half-and-half pitcher.  

Um. . .

I flag down the waitress and ask her for a deeper bowl.  She says they don't have any bowls.  (WTF?!?!)  Er....so I'm supposed to eat my cereal off a plate??  She says she can give me another plate, and I'm like, um okay I'll take it because they gave me way too much cereal on that first plate.  I figured I could scoop some onto another plate for easier eating.  So, yes.  A giant plate with overflowing cereal, and milk sitting in the middle of all that cereal in a half-and-half pitcher.  With a side of pickles.

WEIRD!

Oh, and then we turn around and see that the guy behind us had this HUGE pastrami-looking sandwich that looked about a foot-tall.  We had to go and take pictures of that thing because it was truly monstrous.  He was a grown man, and he looked scared of it too.  My friend noted that "even when he was finished with the sandwich, it was still 3896 feet tall!"  

AWESOME.

We went through our meal, laughing and shaking our heads.  By the end, the pickles were untouched, so I decided to give it a try.  I learned that pickles, dipped in apple sauce and sour cream (from the blintzes), are quite delicious!  Odd combination, but better than straightup sour!

All in all, one of the strangest meals I've never had, yet also one of the most fun and satisfying of my life too!  

Thank you, Mirage, for your odd eateries.  I approve!I'm only reporting on the breakfast, it was A OK, nothing special.  You would do better at the buffet across the casinoWhat's the difference between this Carnegie Deli and the other reviews page?

I didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.Ok let it be said loud and clear..THERE ARE NO COUPONS THAT GET MEN IN FOR FREE AT ANY LAS VEGAS CLUB!!! AND WOMAN YOU ARE ALWAYS FREE B4 12 AND GET ALL YOU CAN DRINK WRISTBANDS!! Of course the "free" booze is limited to certain drinks, you get your standard vodka cranberry, beer, and some shots. We were handed some bogus coupon from a street vendor stating guys in for free but later found out they weren't, but the club promoter decided to let my hubby and friends in for $20 a person instead of $30. The club itself was just ok. The music was great and the layout is ok. There was a strange mixture of ppl here, some were older some younger, my girlfriend and I dressed up in hot cocktail dresses only to find woman wearing jeans and tank tops? The best bet here is to get table service, but at a 2 bottle minimum w/ bottles starting at $475 i'll PASS! Next time it's Marquee for us! Too many ppl w/ hardly any space for ppl if you don't have a table. You're either on the small dance floor w/ creepy ppl or shoved up top at a crowded bar.This place was picked by my sister . It was cool . I dnt think I would want to go back . Dance floor was crazy packed but the set up of the club was nice .Went here with a group of 8 on a Friday evening. We were seated right away although they did not have a record of our reservation.   All entrées were served in hearty portions. I had the Tomahawk steak.  Good size.  Asked for it to be cooked to medium...closer to medium rare.pretty good bar, i like the interior atmosphere and decor. It's like a private lounge. You can smoke on the patio. We met the guy who did the nice metal work outside the bar. My lemon drop martini was made with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Wasn't very strong though, oh well.The ratio of customers to waitress/dim sum carter-ers was too little. I kept looking around for the next cart and only til the last cart did I get the shrimp har gao that I was craving.

Their noodles were greasy and DELICIOUS =) Just what I wanted!

And it's not as good (quality of food and quickness of carts) as Chang's but, not hating. I was craving dim sum and I got it at 9pm on Christmas Day!
It did what it needed to do: satisfy me!This was the first and only all dim sum place I've been to in Vegas and have been really lazy to venture out into something else. It's opened 24 hours and parking isn't horrible, but can sometimes get packed during weekend afternoons. Sometimes guests are turned off by the aggressive nature of the people handling the carts, but I completely get it, it's their job. I just smile and say "no thank you".  The dining room is huge, so even if there is a long wait, the wait isn't so bad. My favorite items are the BBQ pork buns, custard buns for dessert and the fried shrimp dim sum that you can completely engulf in the yummy mayo sauce they have. They do have a regular menu you can order off of too, if dim sum isn't your thing. If anyone has any other good dim sum recommendations in the Vegas area, please let me know :DThe area is old, but still functioning well. There are quite a few rides you can enjoy, even with its limitation of being an indoor amusement park. Really, you have nothing to lose, because the place charges $ per ride, unless you opt for the all-day pass. Just take a look around, and let your kids pick and choose. I guarantee that they are going to have fun - adults and teenagers, not so sure.decent aquarium to go to if you have an hour you want to kill, especially if you have young children.

pros:
- beautifully built, especially the main aquarium  with all the sharks
- pretty decent sized sting ray touch pool
- decent collection of freshwater fish/wildlife. the aquariums were all built so lushly with dense vegetation. it really felt like you stumbled upon a lake in the wild.

cons:
- price! but, i suppose nothing in vegas is cheap unless you win at the craps table. it was about $17/adult! for that much money id expect to at least see two hours worth of stuff

tip:
- try to get there early! we got there around 1030 (the aquarium opens at 10) and waiting about 15 mins before going in. it was packed. by the time we left at 1130ish, the line was LONG just to get in. 

would i come again? probably not unless i had my niece with me again.Sitting alone with a pyramid of creamers (27 of em, I counted), without a crowd, without a buffet line-up, I experienced fair prices in peace, with lovely and attentive service.

Toast is served in a basket, a glass of water large enough and fit for a King; and good, strong coffee (priced too high, a flippin $3.50 - I could so lose that kind of dinero in a slot machine!).

The menu has a nice amount of selections, and a great alternative to the buffet.This is your typical cafe/diner.  They serve breakfast food, burgers, and other things.  I ordered the skillet, which contained hash browns, cheese, eggs, and bacon.  The food took awhile to come.  They were not too busy, so I do not know why service was slow.  When it finally came, I was a little surprised because the skillet was so tiny.  It was about the size of my fist!  Regardless of its size, the skillet was actually pretty good.  The hash browns were crispy, and the cheese was nicely melted.  The bacon bits were mixed in really well.  

A little bit pricey for what I ordered, but all in all, I would recommend this place to people staying at the Luxor.  It is a shame that this place closes right after lunch.My third time in Vegas and we decided a roller coaster on the strip was necessary.  And considering the NY NY coaster's first hill climb was literally outside our window, we opted for this one.

$14, no wait as long as you don't want the front seat.  They took pictures even before you took off!  And you're off.  We waved to our room as we climbed up and up!  And then the pain begins.  Don't get me wrong, it was fun but OWW! And it bent one of my earrings.  Loops, cork screws and what felt like a bit over a minute later we were back inside the casino!  It went by I didn't have time to look out over the strip.  

I'm glad I finally did one.  I can say I did it.  But I probably would rather use that $14 on an overpriced drink instead next time!I'm ready for brunch now. :) The banana nut muffin was amazing though. Especially with butter. mmm...I would give it 3.5 stars.  

The Main Lobster Pot Pie is overhyped.  There.  I said it (*ducking*).

If the lobster pot pie cost half of the current market price ($85 this past weekend), then it would taste a whole lot better.  But I split a pie with my friend and it was just sad to see spread out in front of me 3 small chunks of lobster and a lobster tail and know that I was paying 40+ for my portion of that.  The lobster had some truffle cream sauce around it, but it wasn't exactly swimming in it as I had expected.  The lobster chunks tasted fresh, and the truffle cream sauce was good.  But the crust - the beautifully golden crust looked so promising when the pie was rolled out on the serving cart.  Unfortunately, the crust was so flavorless and dry that once I ran out of the truffle cream sauce to dip it in (and that didn't take long because there was not much to begin with), I had to gulp down water in order to wash down the crust.  I'm not saying don't order the lobster pot pie  - just don't go in like I did expecting it to rock your palate.

If you plan to split lobster pot pie, you will probably need appetizers to fill you up. These appetizers are not to be missed: Chilled Cucumber Soup, Seared Foie Gras, Tomato Fondue (especially the latter!).  

The Braised Beef Short Rib was decent - the best part being the peas and carrots and not the short rib.  My friend got the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and said that was one of the least appetizing tuna dishes he's ever ordered at a restaurant.  

Service was excellent, except the kitchen forgot one of our orders (so we just cancelled it).  My friends really enjoyed the wine.Note to self: Find a better 24 hour place when you're in Las Vegas.  OK, so we just arrived in Sin City so my friends and I decided to get some food.  One of the staff members recommended this place and we were hungry (flying on an empty stomach does me no good), so we went here because it was across the street from our hotel.  I ordered spinach/artichoke dip and a lettuce wrap.  My friends ordered different variations of fried chicken.  Some random guys from Portland sitting behind us recommended NOT ordering the steak.  All of these items seemed a bit sub par.

The dip had a weird skin on it.  My lettuce seemed wilted and pretty bland.  Maybe it was an off night but I don't think I'll be going back here again next time I'm in the LV.  Even for a starving person, this food didn't really do much for me.  Prices were OK by Vegas standards.This is the MGM's version of the standard casino cafe.  It's one of the best among its type.  I've eaten here several times and the food has always been fine - basic, but fine.  I don't think I've ever had a dinner entree, but mostly stayed with breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, etc.  Yeah there are much better choices in the MGM, but it serves its purpose - a fairly large cafe menu with enough options for everyone in your group in their casual attire, open most hours of the day.Eh... That about sums it upA really slick loungey-type place that was a bit underwhelming.  Been there a couple of times - once for dinner on a weeknight, and once for drinks on a weekend night.   Drinks and bar snacks are a better experience.  They have some corn crusted waffle fries that blow Chick-fil-A away.  

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??  

Also, the chicken torta was extremely greasy and gave me the burps the rest of the night.  And I'm not one with a sensitive stomach so it caught me by surprise.  

The vibe, drinks and service were great, but don't go for the food.  The "Latin inspired"  food is disappointing for Phoenix.  Our bartendress was superb.  If anything, go for the service, the drinks and the digs!I'm giving five stars for the awesome food and the Sangria. If you go during happy hour you can get some great nachos or calamari. $12 pitchers of Sangria on Sunday are awesome, but prepared to get your ass kicked if you kill too many pitchers. The bar area and patio are really nice as well. Where this place loses points is the attitude of some of their bartenders. Some are nice but some have their noses so high in the air it's amazing that there's air to breathe at that altitude.OK, so here goes the review for Ticoz.  I am glad to see that the restaurant was busy yesterday...I mean it looked really packed, which is great for the owners because they are real nice people!  The main issue we had was the server.  I think she could have been a little overwhelmed because it was so busy at the time.  She was at least friendly which really made up for it!  My bf ordered the chicken sandwhich and I ordered the beef torta.  The food took a while to come out but when it did at least it was hot.  My bf enjoyed his sandwhich and fries.  I would give my torta an E for effort!  The beef was a little fatty and it had a lot of grease coming out of it.  We also ordered the churros for dessert.  The ice cream was good, the churros were good but could have been a little warmer!

We will go back because the food is good and the people are friendly.  I think it will take some time for the servers to get use to the flood of people...nothing that cant be fixed!Ordered some cupcakes for the superbowl here.  The cupcakes were pretty good imo, not the best i've ever had.  The decorations were super cute, and everyone at the party we went to loved them.  They were super expensive though for a dozen cupcakes.  I haven't tried many cupcake places in the valley, but this one is alright.Burgers are actually very good. Prices are .. well.. airport prices. 
Boring but passable beer menu. 

Bartender and waiter/waitresess work their tails off.Insalata carrabba Caesar with shrimp had too much dressing:( should hv asked for it on the side
Tag pic pac pasta was ok home made pasta tasted good but it stack together do it was not easy to move. 
Service was good and fast but unlike our other visits to the Carabba's in Henderson the food was not the best this time.Food is good and I like the variety to choose from. Haven't been disappointed yet.  I don't really like this restaurant at this location. It's the atmosphere and it just feels over crowded.Well after reading all of these lukewarm reviews,  I guess I'm very lucky. I've never had a bad meal here. I usually order the crispy teriyaki chicken & it's always excellent.  Even if there's only two bites left I want to wrap it & take it home! My son always gets mac n cheese & chicken tenders and they're so good I always have to eat one of them. My only complaint is with the service.  My waitresses always seem to act as though they're waiting on me just to hurry & get it over with. On one visit the young waitress took my plate away when there was food still on it....I wanted to take my leftovers home!! I was pissed!! My most recent visit my waitress rushed away after we each ordered an entree. I wanted to order an extra order of chicken fingers for my son as his appetite has grown to adult size. My friend had to call the waitress back (Katrina) where she abruptly asked "you don't think he'll have enough chicken in his kids meal?" Umm....No...that's why I'm ordering more!!! Don't worry, I'll pay for it!! I love the food here but the service leaves me to believe that everyone hates their job in there.I came here after a so-so night at Body English. Ditched my drunk friends back at the hotel, and met up with another group of peeps who had a table out on the balcony.  

Pretty much walked right in the door, and sat down. The music was Latin that night, which was pretty awesome (for me, cause I dig it)  the dancing was fun.

This I could see not being a cool club, if you were with just 1 or 2 people, but with a table, and the view, and the amenities we had, we had a great time.  I'd totally do it again.  Also, company plays a lot into it, and my company that night was 5 stars.It's yummy but VERY rich food, it makes me sick usually and I am usually full after just a cup of clam chowder.We stumbled upon this place last minute while searching for a late night snack. 

Very slow service and a our server was hard to understand as he didn5 understand us asking him to speak up and he had a very thick accent.

Now the food...
I had the onion soup. It came with this thick layer of cheese and a soggy crustini inside. Now for most soups I thought it came with a crustini on top.

My husband had the turkey club which was exactly that a plain dry turkey club.

My friends had dessert. One the creme brule the other had the frozen tiramisu.

Creme brule was average.
Tiramisu was served in oversized coffe cup with whip cream and chocolate chips on top. It was ok, I wont go back for it. Chocolate chips were definitely not needed.Great menu for restaurant week last month, but honestly not the least bit exciting in the food department (I had a boring salmon dish, my wife had a boring overcooked and over-seasoned steak with mashed potatoes).  I felt that we got a decent enough value for our price, paying more for the classic tiki ambiance than anything else, but I don't think I'd return ever again to order off of the regular menu.  *Note on value: awesome half-off wine list.

That said, the after dinner coffee cocktail I tried was a solid standout from the bar (and this place is primarily known for its bar), and the coconut desert thing they served was pretty tasty as well.  *Note about dessert: had it cost anything extra, I wouldn't have ordered it -- I never get dessert when I go out -- so at least I got the chance to try something different and enjoy it, I suppose.

But the service.....  Thankfully our server was totally cool.  When I first called the restaurant with a question prior to arrival, the guy who answered was a total jerk and so he got jerkiness in return.  I was in a much better mood upon meeting up with my wife and a couple of good friends when I got there, though, so I let it go.

Then, throughout our dinner, we kept hearing the sound of crashing plates and glasses from the bussers (pretty sure this was a record for broken dishes outside of a Greek celebration or a fight) -- not too disruptive, but also kind of uninspiring albeit slightly comical.

And for the grand finale, as we were about to leave, the chef came out to meekly say hello to his tables.  This did not seem like the kind of chef who likes to be out in front of the public, which is fine by me, but it's probably required by corporate.  So it seemed awkward -- I felt bad for the guy.

All in all, it was a pretty good night, but I wouldn't particularly blame Trader Vic's for it.  They were just good enough.Big Bang is a pretty sweet thing when you consider how many cool spots there are in the Valley.  Residing under a bar where the women dress as slutty librarians which is under a Hooters, there are a lot of expectations for a place like this.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't do much right.  

The music is fine but there are a lot of places where you can't see the piano.  It is just one of the limitations of the building.  The place is spread out over about 5 different levels which can either be hazardous or entertaining, depending on if you are the drunk trying to navigate back to your seat.  There is a bar at each end of the place but the lower/smaller one is the only one open during Happy Hour.  If you want to avoid college kids wearing $200 jeans, this is not a place for you.

The positives are pretty awesome though.  $3 everything except Red Bull during Happy Hour is a pretty wicked deal.  It is close to the LRT stop on Mill Ave so it makes drunken bar hopping easy.  The booze selection is pretty good and the entertainment gets better as the night goes on.

It's not a bad place.  Shout House is a bit better but is way out in Glendale and doesn't have LRT access.  If you want to go to a Piano Bar, this is a pretty good place.Yee haawwww Talk about racial tension. So Gilley's is a cowboy bar where they do play country music. They do have a killer cowpen to do some rootin tootin line dancing. From the Tush Push, two step, electric slide....just don't tell my heart. My achey breaky heart......So didn't try the food. I had my twins apply here - (former students of mine) and they got a job so I saw them a couple time fer some free beers. Yee ha. Unfortunately - I'm not a big country music fan. Plus I don't really like nascar. Dont drink Coors....so not my favorite place. For what it is....Bikini bull riding and mud wrestling. As long as they're not cousins....Nuff said...I came here for the Tour de Cure pep rally dinner (which was great).  The food: mini chimibagas good, taquitos: ok, and yummy salsa, chips, and guac. Not too big a fan of the beans but I never really am. Kinda greasy but a great help to pack on the calories for 100 mile riders. Good places for an outdoor bar hangout and stage area.  Worse case scenario, get trashed on the happy hour cheap drinks and you won't remember the negatives!A very expensive place to eat for what they offer!  I will give them the fact that their food is filling...a lot of starchy foods!

I think the reason they have high prices is due to the fact that they put out a lot of coupons.  Check a local Las Vegas magazine (i.e. at the airport, in a Subway restaurant, etc.), there is a 50% off your entire order coupon.  I used one and got 50% off 3 items and the price was still $15!

The food is descent...nothing to write home about.Have stayed here for a couple bachelor parties and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the fact that they have kitchen and also a washer and dryer which is helpful in las vegas.This is a pretty good buffet for seafood lovers.

Depending on the time you come, there may be a line that you have to wait in until you get seated. It appears that they have a lot of tables, but they do not open all the tables until the line is long enough.

My suggestion is to come early (4pm-5pm) to beat the crowd.

My recommendations:
- Prime rib: The meat was so delicious. I can compare this to prime rib restaurants.
- King crab legs: I believe this is a big hit for all the buffet goers. Although I don't like it as much as other people, and I did go a bit overboard with dipping the crab into the butter, I can see why people might like it.
- Tilapia: This fish was so delicious with the tomato sauce they served this in.

I like how this buffet has a variety of different regions of the world. I did skip out on the Chinese section though because the food didn't look as good. Plus, I can eat this type of food on a regular basis!

They have such a variety of desserts that I couldn't help but want to try them all!

Overall, I did have a good meal here, but I felt there were a lot of food that wasn't too memorable for me. I think I'd like to try other buffets in Vegas first before I return.It's not Starbucks is the best thing I can say about the place. I used to live nearby and would make this a regular stop on Sunday mornings. Pick up a bagel at Chompies and a latte at 3 Roots sitting on the lovely patio furniture enjoying the unusual quiet that can only be found at that time of day on a Sunday in downtown Tempe. Enjoy those fleeting fragile moments. 

The coffee is good enough, I always liked it. My previous issue was only ever that at the time I live in the neighborhood, there was only one size for an iced drink and it was served in stryo cup. Hopefully, that's changed in the last couple of years. 

The furniture is cheap and strangely "made over" to look eclectic and hip. Whatever. I've enjoyed a first date or two on a couch or bench in that room, but it seems like its always hot. From reading other reviews, seems many would agree.

If you go, learn the way to the back parking lot through the alley. It's way easier to get in and out of that way. You can't make a left(north) turn from the front lot, so the alley provides you a north bound option. Plus, you can feel like you're at least 20% cool as the staff by knowing how to navigate the alleys of old Tempe. 

Personally, though the hipster vibe was alive and well, I never had anyone be a dick to me so it was fine. I doubt seriously they recognized me as one of their own, but who knows, maybe I looked enough like a resident to pass. Well, I was, so who knows.

Overall, I like 3 Roots but I don't make a point of it when I'm in the old hood.One of my wife's favorite restaurant.  She loves to eat the salsa and the Guacamole Live (table side) is her favorite.  Made to order with just the right ingredients to taste.

I'm partial to the heart-attack Chili Con Caso, not that it is spicy, but high levels of things that are bad for you.

I usually get the burritos, not much else appeals to me.  The fajitas are so-so, and the other dishes are okay for some variety.  The beef triple sauce burrito is one of my picks.The long islands are strong, and a great deal during happy hour. This place is just your typical sports bar with typical pub food. It's a little fancier, I'd say, compared to other sports places, but still casual. Waitresses in tiny outfits serve you beer and food, and pics of sexy bodies (women) in sports gear or holding a football let you know this is a great place for dudes! I'm just not that into sports so this place is just average and predictable. But honestly, if you love watching a game, good beer and drink specials, and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place.Jack of all trades, master of none.  I have to commend The Cheesecake Factory for offering up meals that will appeal to anyone, but aren't really outstanding.  I had a vegetarian pasta that, while very tasty, made me feel like it expanded to about twice its' normal size in my belly about a half hour later.  Not a good feeling . . .

The avocado egg rolls were very welcome to two Californians on vacation but needing their avocado fix, but they were a little salty.

So, if you're in a diverse group that's hard to please, it might be worth the stop, or if you want a meal with a cheesecake dessert, then obviously this is a great choice, but for true culinary satisfaction, keep on' truckin . . .Standard CCF operation with super over whelming menu.  I get a huge headache after looking at everything.  Do i want one of their 20 salads, 20 burgers, 20 sandwiches, 50 apps?  You get the point.  There are hundreds of items on the menu.

I guess it's a "safe" option to take someone b/c you can find something for everyone.  The service was pretty slow on a Thurs late night.  Overall this location is what you would expect from Cheesecake.  The desserts are obv awesome and I like the firecracker salmon app.Hash House A Go Go...Famous cuz it was on Man vs Food.
I've only gone to this location but apparently the original one is in San Diego and they recently opened one in Imperial Palace.
Imperial Palace of all places!?!!?  GROSS!!!!

If you are hungry this is the place to go.
Portions are just HUMONGOUS, GIGANTIC, OUT OF THE ORDINARY!
If you want to get a coronary after eating this is the place to go as well.

Don't get me wrong though...The dishes are Damn good...
But if you feel like eating what is normally an appetizer as a meal (The Crab Cake made dish)...ugh...
I personally got the Sage Chicken Benedict....Now that was good stuff!  I got it with Egg Whites only...like that would really help me remove some fat and calories.

Definitely a place to try but I think a bit expensive...Their dishes are HUGE, and I mean freakin' huge! Probably enough to feed half of your family! Try their Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade, it's to die for. Went their for breakfast and dinner and they didn't disappoint.Everytime I go there's a huge line so I know it's always packed especially Fri-Sun when there are tourists as well. I asked the waitress for whatever she recommends. It came, I ate just a bit and it wasn't all that. It's a cool environment but it's greasy as hell. It's like a kfc but nicer place with cooler attire and ofcourse a bit pricier. It's nothing to go out of your way. I would say try it but don't make it a habbit. Wasn't too fond of the greasiness factor.I went a few months back for the first time after years of hearing the hype. I had my mind set up before I went that I was going to try the bacon bloody mary and the eggs benedict. While the bloody mary was on point, the eggs benedict was a miss for me. For starters, it is a massive amount of food, which is ok, but since I truly missed that traditional hollandaise sauce taste, I left a lot un eaten. Also had a giant sprig of rosemary on the dish that I didn't care to have on there. Service was good, but won't be running back any time soon.Great view, nice people, take grandma if she has never been out of Roundup, MT or Raymond, WA. Restaurants like this have their place and I wouldn't knock them as simple done well is better than complicated done poorly. If you like interesting dining however, take a pass and go get a nice bowl of pho or hit the Indian buffet. Either would surpass this place but getting granny in the door of the Indian buffet might be a harder sell.I'd have rather give 2 1/2 stars. That being said the food was OK. The problem with most BBQ joints in Vegas is that none of them do enough business to ensure high quality. I got the three meat with 1/4 rack baby backs, 1/4 chicken, and thenpork links with mac and cheese and coleslaw.  The ribs did fall off the bone but felt like they had been microwaved to heat them up. The chicken was dry and overcooked. You know how when chicken sits too long it gets a little translucent?  The pot sausage was VERY salty, but it was tasty. The mac and cheese was good once I put salt on it. Maybe they can take the pork links and mix them into the mac and cheese?  The coleslaw wasn't that good. Not much flavor and it looks like it may have started to freeze. The top layer of the cabbage was translucent as well. Not to mention it took nearly 25 min to get my food once it was ordered and I wasn't the only one that was waiting. There was a party of 10 that seemed to be getting a lot of attention from the staff at the detriment of everyone else. I wish these guys luck, but the most consistent places in town to get ribs are Lucilles, Roma's, and Applebees, in that order.Eh.  I walked in to Tao drunk.  Way too drunk and I think sushi was a bad move, but I was hungry and craving spicy tuna.  The waiter was good looking, the ambiance was typical and the food was nothing memorable.  I did try the lobster dumplings to start and those were very good, but the sushi was just okay.  The drinks, not that I had needed anymore were very, very good.I did my bachelorette party here it was nice and convenient to be able to stumble from one bar to another. I guess I never noticed the slutty teens that someone else mentioned because I was there after they are allowed out. I can't say much for the shopping because I really never did much of it at this place. I just know that I had fun drunk, and I think its better then the Arizona Center.My first visit was so-so. Our server took forever to come to our table and the service in general wasn't so great. 

The food was decent, but I expected a little better. We had the steak for our main course and weren't too impressed with it. I will say though that I really enjoyed the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip that we had as an appetizer. Our dessert on the other hand was not good at all and we had to send it back. Stay away from the Strawberry Cheesecake. 

The place itself seems like a fun place to go for dinner and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I think I would try it again, but I am hoping to find some better service and better food all around on my next visit.How can you complain when you can get a steak and crab legs, salad, and baked potato for $14 in Las Vegas and leave super full? Its not the best quality food but, if you are looking for a filling meal..this is where its at. Shout out to Mono....your girls from VA are coming to see you soon!Ya, I join the cult.  I have all their products.  And here is another chain in the Vegas area, this time in Mandalay Place.  Compared to a Gillete Foamy, you will pay much higher for the cost of shaving products.  But then again, you get a much higher quality product.  Once you go there, you will realize that they are worth it.  So, join the cult.Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar.

Actually I didn't love it but it was OK.  Here's the thing about these theme bars, it attracts a lot of the fans.  A lot of country music fans are toothless hill jacks.  Where some of them are normal people like myself the majority tend to be the flea market grifter types.  So that's kind of what you get here.  It's a mix of normal folks, like you and me I am sure, and those who have a skoal ring on the back of their jeans...and I am talking about the ladies.  The back pocket comb is still in style here and the beers on tap match that vibe; Coors Lite and Miller Lite if I am not mistaken.     

The menu?  A whole bunch of really unhealthy bar food.  They have drinks called things like Toadsuck Pond and the Who's Your Daddy Margarita.  Pretty much all the sandwiches will run you around $14.  It's Vegas, I understand that but that's still a bit pricey for a burger.  But what is that I see on the menu?  The "World Famous" Fried Bologna Sandwich?  Fried Bologna outside the comforts of my Lazy Boy reclining chair?  Hoooo Doggy!  Hold the phone!  It's on.  

This grease laden, artery cloggin' monster sandwich was chock full of processed meat goodness.  Thick sliced bologna, grilled onions and God Bless a-freaking-merican cheese.  Well hot dam the only thing that could make that any better would be to slap that sumbitch on thick buttered Texas Toast.  And the lord said let it be so, and it was good.  

Service?  Well I can't cotton to that none.  It was slow as molasses in January but hotter than Georgia asphalt in July if you know what I mean.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.  The overall vibe?  If NASCAR was held at the Kentucky Derby or something this is what you would get.  It was too clean to be country.  Too organized to feel down home kick up your feet and sit a spell.  It's Vegas though they like their shit not to stink even when it's supposed to a little bit.  So while it wasn't horrible if it wasn't for the Bologna I probably would never come back.There are really only two reasons to come to this spot. 1) People watching. 2) To laugh at the shrine Toby Keith created to himself.

The music (when there is a live band) is actually pretty good. But the people watching is what brings me back again and again. The clientele here is so mixed. All the cowboys in town find their way here, but so do the bachelorette parties, woo girls, frat boys, football fans, old couples, etc. 

It gets quite packed at peak times. Bar and table service can be exceptionally slow. The food ain't much to write home about. The drinks are overpriced and kinda sucky. But you don't come here for the eating and drinking. You come here to walk around, shake your head, and repeatedly say to yourself "just who the hell does Toby Keith think he is?!" - and to just watch all the crazy people having a crazy time.Actually stayed at a local casino as I had some friends in town from the bay area and so we all stayed at the MGM Signature Hotel.

1.  Parking -  5 star - If you are local, they all have their own valet and parking. I did not find self parking, however, the valet was fine. Sometime it took a little bit of time to get the car, yet much faster than casino valet.  The valet jockeys were all nice. 

2,  Bell Desk - 5 star - When you arrive, they assist you with your luggage. I noticed they were very busy yet the team was always there when you needed them.  We had rolling luggage, so we did not need them in the end, yet they were very helpful and attentive. 

3.  Check In - 1 star - We checked in at about 3:30 pm on Friday.  Fridays on a summer month are still busy in Vegas.  My question is, why would they have a staff of two checking everyone in, allow a line of 10 to be created when they have check in computers for at least 6-7 staff?  Did not make sense.  One person in front of us had to be given water by the security as he looked like he was gonna pass out... This is Vegas.  It is Friday.  The impression of the hotel with only 12 people in line watching 2 people handle check in inefficiently is not a positive customer service event.

4.  Suites - 5 star - Absolutely fantastic.  Clean, luxurious, big, sophisticated.  This is not the Four Seasons, or Venetian or Bellagio, however, it is awesome in its own right.  Perhaps a simpler sophistication.

5.  Amenities - 3 star- Small Gift show for food and stuff. - Convenient  Starbucks - Not sure why they don't have more staff from 7 - 9:00 am when 30 people are in line. All of the towers in the MGM Grand go to the same starbucks, or attempt to.  So, line management for a resort should be considered. Not much else.

6.  Walk to facilities - 2 star - To get to the MGM Grand with all things a casino has to offer, dining, gambling, entertainment, you have to walk about 8 minutes.  While it is actually a decently quick walk inside tunnels and all, it is simply not good.  Late at night, it is limited as cleaning crews are cleaning. revelers are being boisterous and if your lady friends are in heels, well, that will not be fun at all.  Very convenient and inconvenient!

I like this place and can recommend it. I would just warn many people the it is a great deal, just that it is not as convenient and properly managed like you would expect.Good Quality, Good Service, Affordable Prices, Great Selection for American Comfort Food.  Not bad prime rib either.

more later...Not bad for airport food... especially Phoenix airport food. If stuck right at that exact location, I'd eat there over the alternatives.They get three stars now. They changed chefs. I used to brag about this place and anytime family or friends visit I made sure I took them to the bar. I went about a week ago and there was a new cook. The gumbo was still good but ....not as good.Mama Mi Casa! For one of the most visually stunning restaurants I can think of, the subpar service speaks volumes.
I've been here multiple times, and usually eat at the bar but have eaten in the dining room. The menu has a nice vairiety, and prices are reasonable. The chips and salsa is very good, and one of my faves at any Mexican restaurant. I recommend the steak & shrimp,the avocado fries and the desserts. 
Be prepared to wait, to get drinks, and usually to order.I should start off by saying that I am not a Jerry Seinfeld super fan. Probably not even a regular fan. To be honest, I didn't even know what to expect from him. Sure I have seen a couple of episodes of his show but not more than that. 

What can you expect? Clean and adult family styles jokes. He talks about marriage, kids, things adults love & more. 

For me the funniest segment was the marriage skit. However, within my group I must have sat in between the biggest Seinfeld fans because these guys could not stop laughing. I mean really, based on how much they were laughing I feel bad for giving three stars. But this review is based on my experience right?

Overall, I had a good time. The venue is nice, Jerry has a good grasp on his audience and can tell a good clean joke and still make us laugh.We have eaten at several Claim Jumper locations. This one is average. 

Service was ok, another waiter kept helping us because our waitress, Amanda, was busy in the back... Break?? 

So when the waiter, still not Amanda, brought out our food he marveled at how excessively large our portions were, compared to the normally excessively large portions, tonight's portion seemed obscenely excessively large, and truly worthy of pointing out. 

HOWEVER, the portions were not really obscenely excessively large... We ordered the Country Fried Steak as we always do. In reality these were thinnest steaks I have ever seen served as a steak. These could've been on a steak sandwich they were so thin. In fact if you added together the top an bottom breading, the breading was thicker than the meat inside. 

The portion of the potatoes was not as large as they normally are. 

All in all we would go back to Claim Jumper. But we were disappointed with this meal.Not bad. I probably won't go back anytime soon but it is a cool place to take in the view. It was expensive, the wait staff has a way of recommending things that all add up. Our check was over $200 for balsamic steak, chicken Marsala, a side of risotto and gnocchi, and a glass of wine each.For a 'mid range' restaurant, it was really expensive - total tab for 2 came out to $120, which included a really bad bottle of white.  Oh well, I guess it is Vegas after all, where you can't expect to pay less than $50 per person for 'mediocre' food.I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . . 

VinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.

Good service, check
Outdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, check
Nice ambiance, check
Good pizza, check

Keep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.

Everything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is.This place was great for the price and concept. We came here with a big group for Father's Day and we sat in the side area. 
They had happy hour wine ($6 a glass) till 6 and we took full advantage of it. They brought out hot fresh garlic bread and kept it flowing throughout dinner. 

I had the Chicken Scarpara which was chicken sautéed with garlic, lemon, mushrooms and pepperocinis in a white wine reduction. The wine reduction was a bit runny but the flavor overall was pretty good. 

The wine list was extensive and our server was great, she was quick to refill drinks and take orders (and with a group as big as our that is impressive). 

This is a great place for a big group and easy on the wallet. A-OK!Stopped here unexpectedly last night (Friday) and was seated at a four-top even though it was pretty busy indoors.  I don't recall the name of my server, but he was oh so very patient w/ me as he tried to answer my food allergy concerns with everything from beer to specialties and the fish and chips (turns out his ex-girlfriend had food allergies, too). 

I asked him for a beer recommendation since I've only started to appreciate beers; I've always liked fruity cocktails and sweet wines.  I've NEVER liked the taste of beers, although I did enjoy the sips of San Miguel light beer mixed with Sprite or Seven-Up that relatives would let slip for us kiddies to try.  However, with micro-breweries and seasonal brews a-plenty, I find that beer-tasting (and seeing which ones match well with food) can be as much fun as wine-tasting.  (Sounds like I've done a lot of beer-tasting, huh?  I can count the times I had a couple sips of beers on one hand!)  But I digress...  My server suggested a Blue Moon, which I almost didn't get to try since it looked like I was allergic to every dish I selected (he'd go to the back to double-check).  I think he could see I was about to bolt, bec. he suddenly appeared with a cold glass of Blue Moon, w/c came w/ an orange slice.

Since I didn't want to leave with an open bar ticket unpaid, I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the Fish and chips platter, even though the kitchen couldn't confirm that the batter was *-free.  Am I glad I did!  The platter took about 20 minutes to arrive, but when it did I was happily munching away on crispy, fresh-tasting beer-battered haddock, w/c I sprinkled with fresh lemon juice and occasionally dipped in tartar sauce.  Yessir, I was really living on the edge now!  *-allergy be damned!  I even sampled the itsy-bitsy side of coleslaw, w/c I'm pretty sure had * in the dressing.  Oh, and the beer tasted fine.  So much so, I almost bought a six-pack from Sunflower a couple of days later.

I'll be back to try other specialties and their burgers, of which Mac's is famous for.Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality.

I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area.

If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot.I went here expecting to get this "blow your mind" egg salad sandwich I read about in an article on Feb. 22, 2013 only to discover they do not have egg salad sandwiches.  I even mentioned the article and the girl behind the counter just looked at me like I had no idea what I was talking about.  I was disappointed to say the least, since I was craving egg salad.
However, with that said, I did try the lemon basil chicken salad on brioche and it was pretty good.  The brioche definitely was a plus!  The potato salad side was not for me, my personal opinion was that is had way too much mustard in it.
I also tried the most heavenly macaroon I have had in a long time!  It was so light and airy and the taste was spot on!
If I go back, it would be for the macaroons.Solid little breakfast joint. 

I have been here 3 times and my experiences have been pleasant. Food is good but nothing to go crazy over. Service is above average. I believe they have unlimited coffee refills too. 

Pros
- Good food
- Fast service

Cons
- Smaller portions
- Boring menuThe prime rib here is excellent- would definitely go back just for that. I liked how the food was organized by "Latin", "Chinese", "Raw", "Italian", etc, made it very easy to decide where to go. The sushi however looked terrible, and was confirmed by my friend to not be good at all. I would have loved to see more options in the raw section and also in the "noodles" section there weren't any noodles, just rice? All in all, I don't know if I would come screaming back to eat here but it wasn't an unpleasant experience either.Buffet  $30 -packed as usual.  Nothing outstanding but something for everyone to hit the spot.  Crab legs were cold and just OK, prime rib was chewy but OK, the Chinese items were acceptable.  Sushi available, pasta available, salads, all the usual.  Had expected slightly better quality.  All the dessert we tried were delicious, and there was a sugar free choc dessert which was yum!
Mai tai was weak.
Server left my debit card on the table when we were getting our buffet!I was recently notified by a management member that he was truly sorry about the first mishap, nice to see someone is keeping tabs on their business first hand especially in this economic climate when bad critisizm can cost you lots of business. Ill give it another whirl and see what becomes of it.We decided on Rao's because we were on a deadline and Mesa Grill was way too packed to wait for a table. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the salmon was good, the meatballs were pretty good. But that's all it was, just good, nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth the price either. I will say though, that they have the most amazing bread basket evar. You have your long ones, your regular ones, your flat ones, your crispy ones, oh so much fun!

We sat at the bar because we didn't wanna wait 30 minutes or so for a table and I kept getting these weird vibes from our bartender/waiter. Like he'd pause and stare at us after each request, like we had just asked for something unreasonable. Probably because we didn't order any drinks. Lame, let me enjoy my dinner in peace without your condescending looks, old man! Anyway, I wouldn't come back here, as there are far superior places to eat in Vegas.The mixed drink were to lemony all three of them I tried, order wine safer bet.  Food was ahhhmazing!!  Service terrible we had to flag down our waiter to even order. Flag for a second drink twice. Flag down again for pepper and knives for our salads since they them  with appetizer plates, etc.etc.New ownership....couple misses tonight: salad needs to be colder, caramelized onions on our pizza were only sauteed. Wines were really good.... Sangiovese and Pinot Noir.3 stars for this place but that's because it's in Vegas and there are so many opulent restaurants with amazing food in Vegas, I must hold Vegas restaurants to a slightly higher standard.

As far as steakhouses go, this wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special.  I would definitely eat at the Cut or CRAFT (actually numerous places) steak before eating here again and I haven't tried steve wynns steakhouse, but could only imagine it being better as well.

I ordered the 24oz Ribeye which was good.  Turns out it was bone-in which wasn't mentioned on the menu or by the waiter.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered it and was charred nicely.  I believe the steak lacked a little salt but it was still very good.

Ordered the garlic green bean side.  It was good, cant really mess up green beans.  

We had a nice bottle of Tor malbec which I highly recommend.

Overall, if you aren't staying at palms then don't go out of your way to eat here.  Even if you are staying at palms, go to Venetian and eat at the Cut or Delmonicos or head to the Wynn and eat at steve Wynn steakhouse.I like doing tastings, so the tasting of the strange Coke products is fun for me.  Some are delish some...uh, not so much.  But, it's something to do and then you can shop your heart out at the GIANT Coca Cola store.  I don't even need any branded crap, but there is so much there that even I want to buy something.  Crazy.

Go here, taste some Colas, then take pictures with the bear.  You know you want to.I love the 75 mins Vegas hot75x, , not too short and not too long just perfect !!! But I wish they can do something about controlling the numbers in each classes, more than 50 people in one room just way too many .... I went to the class today and I barely could stretch my arms and legs because the class was too full!!! I still like the instructor and the class only if it's not too many people!!!!When this place first opened - I don't want to think about how many years ago - it was a relatively "upscale" place to go for lunch.  We went there for lunch, and occasionally dinner.  The food was always great.  

Within a few years the food was... fine.  So we stopped going.  Every now and then we'd go to the bar - it was in the neighborhood and all.  And the dance floor could be fun, and if the DJ was ok that night, you could have a good time.  

I hadn't been there in at least 6 years, but the other night I was back on that side of town and was in a crowd of folks who "still wanted to do something" but they weren't willing to really drive more than 5 minutes.  (They considered this totally reasonable by the way.  How in the world did I ever get out???)  So once folks started talking about where the nearest Denny's was, or how there was a NEW Village Inn they could try - I volunteered Lagerfields.  It took a few minutes - but they were convinced.  

Good things about Lagerfields - 1) Full menu until 10pm.  After 10 you can still get deserts and most of their appetizers.  In this part of town that's big.  2) Because they are a restaurant during the day, it's never hard to find a table.  Well, that and because the crowds just aren't packing it in over there... 3) It wasn't a bad time.  There was a decent cover band the night we went.  Between sets they played some muzak that was pretty cool for the crowd - we sang along to a few good 80's tunes together.  

So, is this your destination location?  Heck no.  But, if you're ever in the area, and you have a group of friends that you just want to sit and talk with while in a bar setting, it's not the worse option in the area.  

And it beats the heck out of Village Inn.The four of us ordered the full tasting menu, with bread, wine, and cheese at the end. Service was good and friendly, about on par with what I expect at a restaurant of such caliber (and price). Creative breads were a nice touch, and many of the dishes were thoroughly enjoyable, but I honestly can't remember a single dish that really drove me crazy. This meal took place about 2 months ago.

I don't have any particular complaints, but I was overall unimpressed with the dishes in comparison to my expectations. Among all the tasting menus I have had at Michelin-starred restaurants (6 or 7), this was the least memorable.

The bottom line is that there is better value to be had in Las Vegas, but if there are some particular dishes at Guy Savoy that excite you, I would recommend it.We had a group of 8 stay here for a Vegas trip and it was a nice room and quite comfortable.  We got a good deal on the room, and it isn't that far off the strip.  Although we did mainly use our car, it is not unreasonable to walk to the strip from here, but it could take some time.  We had a good room which slept 8 comfortably.  Only complaints were that the staff seemed really confused when we were checking in - it took us like 30 minutes to get everything settled - and they could have provided us with more toiletries like soap and shampoo.  We didn't get a chance to enjoy the rest of the amenities on the trip.  Parking wasn't too bad, although it did get kind of crowded at times.So....shall we start off with some positives?

Ok. The beer selection here is good and the happy hour drink specials are not bad. AND there is a plethera of flat screen TVs that surround you. It's definitely hard to decide whether to stare at the TV or the big tata's attached to the servers. I managed to find a happy medium.

The menu is has great variety, but the food itself was only ok. I ordered the Sloppy Jane, the other half ordered a Salad. The sandwich was huge and messy, just how I like it. The first three bites were devine, and then it started tasting soggier and soggier. The salad was bleh.

As to be expected, the place is definitely a sausage fest...BUT a good place to go to, to catch a game or have a quick drink. I don't think I would linger long enough to watch the masses get wasted though...Walking into this place is like shopping at an international market.  There are some very unique items and its fun to wonder around and check out items like chop sticks set, saimin bowls, and bangles from India.  

I like coming in when they have put out their Christmas stuff.  The ornaments are very different and are so cute.  They have every kind of them you good think of and some one of kind items.  I came last year for my secret Santa gift and they loved it!

They have a small amount of food items, tea and coffees from around the world.  And they usually have some samples waiting to be tried.  If you are looking for some unique decorative items for the house, some quaint English biscuit, or a nice bar stool, this is your place. Be sure to look into their membership card, for general savings and coupons!Came here for lunch with a few friends and loved it!  It was a nice change of pace from the Las Vegas Strip Hotel foods.  They had a lunch special for $11.00 which included your choice of meat for shabu along with all the veggies.  i was happy to see that they included asparagus as one of there veggies and they had the most amazing dipping sauces!  If you are in the area definitely give it a try.  It's not that far off the strip and it wont break the bank.  Next time I plan on trying the sukiyaki, heard that was yummy too.   :)The pizza here tasted really, really good.
The bad? It gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Totally gross.

So... three stars to Sirrico's for letting me enjoy a nice, gooey slice of pizza while making me feel skinny the next day.I am a HUGE fan of Top Chef and Tom Colicchio and I was looking forward to trying out his restaurant.  Unfortunately since I cannot afford Craftsteak at my budget, my friend and I decide to try his sandwich place instead.  I ordered the grilled mozzarella sandwich and a small salad with lemon vinaigrette.  I was a bit disappointed by my sandwich.  The first few bite was good, but after a while it just got very bland tasting.  The salad on the other had was very refreshing.  

My friend's breakfast sandwich looked and tasted a lot better than my grilled cheese sandwich.  Should have gotten that instead.I was expecting great things from this sandwich shop but was disappointed to find basically a glorified lunch counter. The ingredients just didn't seem to be very high quality. The steak melt didn't have enough steak in it. The sandos sound good but the execution didn't seem to be there. For the inflated price tag I want a great sandwich. This wasn't.I'm giving it 3 stars for nostalgic reasons only as I used to come here in high school (90s) and remember it being awesome... but if I had not come here in my youth I'd probably only give it 1 star.  I took my family here recently. Service was great and fast, but the food was just ok for being so pricey. I will not go back again :PI was pretty pleased with the buffet here, though admittedly I really only went there for breakfast.  At $14, I felt breakfast was reasonably priced especially considering it's vegas!  They also have an all day all you can eat pass for $30.

I'm a big fan of breakfast food, so was pleasantly surprised to find they served breakfast till at least noon. They had fried plaintains for breakfast...super bomb, perfectly ripe a surprising inclusion. Their french toast is delicious, but pass on the waffles; they look like great, plump, belgian waffles but are too spongy to enjoy. If you want breakfast get there early because the line to that part of the buffet gets long.Very cool. They have Fernet. However again downtown right off Fremont. I suppose they tried to keep the riffraff out by making the door appear secret however once inside it's pretty cool.

Open a location on the other side of town in Henderson!I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Throw a salad together super quick and cheap," and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good," I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.I had been wanting to try this place for a really long time and finally we decided to give it a try before seeing a move at Harkins.  I was impressed with the decor and the fast pace of the place.   We  were seated promptly and the waitress was there with a smile on her face within minutes to take our order.   Tried the wood grilled filet mignon chopped salad and it was quite good, however after the first encounter with the waitress the service went all down hill.  Our waters were never refilled nor did we ever see the waitress again..we had to go look for who in order to pay the bill. the food was good thus the tree stars, but I think that they need to work on the service end of it to make it a complete dining experience.  Will give it another try though...My husband and I were craving pizza so this seemed like the ideal spot to have dinner. Once we arrived and were seated, it took 10 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table. Once she arrived she didn't even apologize for the wait or ask how out evening was. If the costumer service was better, we would have enjoyed our dinner a lot better. FYI the bus boys were awesome, and food was good!I appreciate the way the Red Rock looks on the inside and outside, it was a journey to get here from the strip (wish I woulda known about the free shuttle) but the place is amazing with a great bar area, BINGO! and bowling of course! I even got in a game of darts. It was a good time we had here and if I went to Vegas again mind you, I would rent a car to get here, I might be back! :) The only thing is, they have an extensive set of rules so I dont know why they wont let an adult hold a 8 pounder, hmph, ah well.I thought it seemed a little unreasonable that I should have to pay a $27 Resort fee for facilities that I was unable to enjoy. For example, I wished to use the pool, but it was closed. Instead, I was offered the clothing-optional Cherry Pool which is not quite the same thing, especially when I was visiting with my boyfriend. The pool area was small and quiet and not set up for swimming, really. No notification of the pool closure was included on the web site, and with the high that day at a balmy 85 degrees it seemed unreasonable to not be offered a pool experience. Worst of all, when I called  the operator on two separate occasions to try to locate the Cherry Pool on the hotel map, they were of NO assistance. I spent over ten minutes on the phone to finally be told that the pool was "somewhere near the Cherry Club, outside." Thanks.

Additionally, the in-room wifi was completely inaccessible from our room on the 18th floor. Also, the doorknob was falling off on the bathroom door. The beds were very uncomfortable and it seemed very difficult to get the temperature in the room right. When we left in the morning at about 7 am to go hike Red Rock, we were approached by a housekeeping staff member who asked us if we would be checking out soon, so she could clean out our room. Wow.

To be frank, although the property is enormously beautiful, it is unlikely I will stay here again unless I plan on hiking in Red Rock in the future. Even then, I'm a lot more likely to stay at my favorite Vegas property, THEhotel, and just drive out to Red Rock instead.

I immensely enjoyed the Feast Buffet, though, with $2 drink specials on margaritas and such. I also enjoyed the in-house movie theater, where I saw Taken, which was brilliant. The bowling alley wasn't offering any specials on Wednesday night that were to my liking, so I decided to pass, knowing that South Point and The Orleans offer $1 bowling after midnight on weeknights. I attempted to play Bingo, but it was going to end up pretty costly for two people-- starting at around $50. Instead, I joined the players club and sat down and lost a little money at the slot machines.

There's a shopping center across the street with a Terrible's, a Borders, a Best Buy, and a Coffee Bean. Overall, I stayed here solely because I was planning on hiking Red Rock and they offered a package which included two free buffets and two free movie tickets, but I would be unlikely to stay here again.Great place especially if you enjoy bohemian women with hairy armpits, bottled beers, and live music any night of the week. Two hairy bushes way way up!!!Don't want to cook, kids have a last minute sleep over, impromptu game night, treat friends who helped your in-laws move...these are all the reasons we order from Rosati's.
I would rather order Rosati's over Domino's or Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.
Let's start with the way they cut their pizza...into small squares...brilliant! I don't always want to eat a whole slice and their portions make it easy not to gorge.
I love the thin crispy crust that stays dry & crunchy. Their toppings are generous and overall good delivery pizza. Enough ratio of cheese to toppings to crust.
If you save your pizza box stubs, you get a discount off your next order. Be sure to ask about their specials when you call.I'm usually in downtown Scottsdale on the weekends unless I'm at my favorite Tempe bar, but when I'm looking for a fun night out with the girls away from the Scottsdale scene, we come to Cherry Lounge & Pit. The bartenders are hot. The drinks are cheap. And there's two rooms where you can dance and chic VIP areas with stipper (er dancing) poles.People stand in the hot AZ in line outside of these Oregano's and I just don't get it. But then again they do the same at Olive Garden. They have OK food and respectable service, even though one of the servers whisked away 2 out of 3 salad bowls while there was clearly over half of one of their large salads quite visible. Then even though we said WHOA the over zealous server (who had his thumb in the eating area of the bowl) tried to put them back down. We insisted he bring new bowls and he couldn't understand why.

My sandwich was decent, the pizza I felt very over priced. It's one of those places I'll go back to if friends insist but I will do my best to steer the party to a better restaurant.I ate there with my husband on a Saturday and watched some college football.  It is a dive, but it has some nice tvs to watch multiple games on.  Standard sports bar atmosphere.  Our booth wasn't very clean, and the restaurant smelled kind of smokey.  Burgers were ordered medium and were well done, not even a little pink.  Food was ok.  It seems popular with a 50 something single crowd.  I probably would't go again personally.Jimmy John's is one of my favorite places around UNLV to grab some food.  They rank on the top of my "fast food sandwich" category, way above Subway, Quizno's, Togo's, or any other mediocre sandwich place.  Their sandwiches are around $5 for an 8" sandwich, which is a great price for a good sandwich.  The service is extremely fast, and the service is friendly, which always makes it easier to come back.  

The sandwiches are what really bring me back, though.  My favorite sandwich is The Vito.  The Vito is a classic Italian grinder, and is one of the most popular things at Jimmy Johns.  I always get the hot peppers, too, which makes the sandwich that much better.  I also really like the BLT, and the Roast Beef and Provolone.  I can't remember what these are called, but the menu's not too confusing to figure out.  

The sandwiches are all made to order, and come out VERY fast.  Usually your sandwich is done by the time you finish getting your fountain drink.  Which brings up another great thing about Jimmy Johns, their fountain drinks.  I usually don't mention fountain drinks as being great, but they have Cherry Coke.  I always like to give props to any restaurant that has Cherry Coke, as it is a rarity, yet is one of the best sodas on the market.  

Definitely go to Jimmy Johns if you love sandwiches, you will love it!Food wasn't too bad here, but next time I'll try something else. I ordered the Bibimbap. It was ok, but I've definitely had better. My family had the Kalbi - a little overpriced I think. It was $35 a plate, but the portion was worth maybe $25. My sister also didn't think the quality was so great (I don't eat meat so can't give my personal opinion). 

However, the staff was pretty friendly and the place was clean enough (from what I could see). I just wouldn't go out of my way to go here. If you're starving and it's on the way to where you are going sure. But if you can wait, I would hold out till you come across something great.I only give this place 3 stars because of the awful service I first received. We went in and say at the far bar. We sat there for 10 minutes being completely ignored by "Oz" while he served everyone around us. He never once acknowledged us but immediately walked up to the two guys who sat down next to us before they were even fully seated. Being in the industry, I am a god tipper and have to say that this "Oz" character missed out on a good tip. If I were the manager of this pub I would be embarrassed to have him as an employee. We finally moved to another section and had good service and some good drinks.I was eager to have a good beer somewhere and had the perfect opportunity after I picked up tickets to Blue Man Group. My wife doesn't drink beer so I stopped by during the day. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about IPAs and gave me a sample of local tap that was very good. I had a pint of Ballast Point Sculpin and chatted with the bartender about baseball. He left my tab open with the check in a pouch right next to me if I wanted to go. I appreciated this as I only had the beer, signed my bill and left without needing him. Decor and vibe was high-end sportsbar which I like when it is quieter in the daytime. I'd go back next time and try the food which looked good. I'll update my review when I do.Strawberry mojitos and taquitos were great!! Wings are gross, but who orders wings at a mexican place? Chips and dip are great :)I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor. Dice dark lighting, red and black colors, chandeliers, good Sinatra type music, very old Vegas feel.

However... Im sorry to say that I did not enjoy the vegetarian options. 
We ordered the caprese salad and the eggplant parmigiana.
The caprese salad was ok.... but it was drenched in an overpowering pesto. Pricey! $15!!!

The eggplant parm ($21!!!) came out soggy and oily. Way too much cheese! The best thing about the dish was it came with a side of grilled asparagus. All 3 of us at the table agreed that the plain asparagus was the most appetizing.

My friend ordered the vodka pasta and the other just plain marinara pasta. They were not impressed either.

Too bad... Too expensive. Im sad I wont be back since I really liked the vibe of the place.We had the chateaubriand with foie gras mushroom sauce and fingerling potatoes with beans and carrots ($92). We ordered an additional side of creamed spinach ($10) which was really good. The meat was decent, but the end was too crisp for my liking. Our server was ok but it seemed like the busser did most of the work, he was great. Our drinks were always filled :). We had the trio creme brulee - vanilla, pistaccio and cinnamon apple. It was pretty good, especially to share ($10).One of the more spacious and industrial Paradise Bakery locations, and another one that does not provide Equal Sweetener.  Not nearly as loud as other spots, particularly during the weekend morning rush, but unfortunately the noise comes in the form of Country Western music.  :-(Who knew Zappos actually had a physical outlet?! We discovered it by accident driving on the freeway in Vegas! We were pretty excited, but when we got there, it was a bit of a letdown. I thought for sure I'd leave with a few pairs in hand, but nada! I didn't find much I liked in the warehouse, and some of the stuff was probably 2-3 seasons or more, old. Oh, well...I'll stick to their site. They seem to have better product on the site. I'm not completely knocking the brick and mortar site because I'm sure this place is probably a haven for shoe fanatics. Just that it wasn't for me that day.The service was great (almost five stars!) Theproperty itself is a bit tired.  Granted I am a 5 star spa  girl, but with the economy......the place needs a face lift, wood rot, ant problem & mildew...Not in the suites. Overall I would give it another chance. Comfy bed, ok food don't expect much if you are a cook.  The best, due to the economy the staff falls all over you. Had a pool, suana and hot tub to myself on a friday.  So sad for them because the people are sweet..    Hopefully things will pick up and they will do some deffered clean up.  I can see how a family would like this place.Took the family here for a couple night seeking some sunshine and warm temperature.  For the price..it's just OK and next time would go elsewhere.  Considering the Ritz is within $50 per night think there are better options.

Pro's:
-enough activity to entertain the kids (9 &12) with multiple pools, lazy river, mini golf, 
-good location, especially if you are heading on to Grand Canyon
-resort fee is reasonable considering the long list of activities you get
-overall cleanliness of hotel

Con's:
-front desk staff was rough
-hotel overall is dated and needs a remodel
-plenty of staff around and on duty...if  you want a service you need to ask (i.e. drinks at the pool).  Usually get better service at Hampton Inn's at half the room rate.
-crowdedWe arrived at 5:00 pm for the buffet dinner off of the living social deal with a party of 7.  I was caught off guard with the 18% gratuity charge.  It ended up being an extra $73 because of it.  I don't recall being charged gratuity at other places. 

The food was nothing special.  I felt the selection was small compared to the other buffets on the strip.  The only reason this isn't two stars is because of the unlimited beer and wine that came with the deal. 

Not worth the extra taxi cab ride to get to this buffet off the strip. You can spend the same amount for better quality on the strip.This bar has a new name. It is no longer Boston's. No more Pizza. 
 Look for my review under the new name - "The Corner Office"

UPDATE: It's Back, but still very empty on most nights. Onj Sunday, they have $2.50 rum drinks and a $10 1 -topping pizza. Quality of pizza is average and probably falls just above the $5 Pizza joints. Blame the conveyor belt cooking.We had a gift card, which was the main motivation in going.  My son LOVES shrimp, so we went for his birthday.  I think the problem was that we were seated in the "bar" area.  Our server was the bartender.  The food was good for Red Lobster.  It took a while to get food, while to get drinking refills, and TOO long for check.  I still tipped my normal 15%, but not impressed.Up-scale environment and wonderful services. The food is good but not spectacular.The is the only churascaria that I know of that has a surf and turf options.  Other places just have the turf like Fogo and Texas de Brazil.  So I was looking forward to it.  Anywho, some of the meats were really good, like their house special and their filet.  They had a prosciutto wrapped scallop which I really liked as well.  But everything else is average compared to the competitors.  If they are going to charge the same prices as the other Brazilian steakhouses, they gotta kick it up a notch.  Everyone loves the cheese bread from Brazilian steakhouses, but this place's, like a lot of the other items, are just nothing to write home about!mmmmmmmmm meh. caesar's is alright. we got a free upgrade so we stayed in the palace towers. it was alright... bigger than the roman towers..and a little nicer. after staying at the palazzo, this is definitely a downgrade. its still a nice hotel. casino's alright...actually i didnt gamble much here.  wish they had $10 blackjack tables. their min is $15. so we went elsewhere. its nice that its connected to the forum shops......bbbuuuuutt, i think i'll stay somewhere else next time. this place didn't impress me too much. but its cheap .. so it'll do if you're tryin to save $.Had a four night stay in the old roman tower.  Newer rooms and except for the old tv room was nicely and newly furnished. Really soft pillows.  There was NO door on the bathroom   Room was clearly designed for couples but if you are shy about showering or going to the bathroom be warned. Toilet is in a corner but not private

Service ok.  One bad thing there were two small old probably blood stains on the carpet.  Food comes out. This had not. More gross the anything. E mailed and called hotel. Still no response three days after we left

Great pool

Decent food but pricey and except for Mesa grill pretty standard fair.  Coffee shop good but horrendously slow.  20 minutes to get a bill.  If clearly caters to large parties and known customers. 

A fun old time place with a history and some flaws.  Really 3 and a half starsFood was just ok. Nothing special about it. Service was ok. Server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes, until I reminded him. Also waited a while for the check. Would have been 2 stars, but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us.DO NOT CONFUSE THIS PLACE with the Oyster Bar at Palace Station- completely different. Somehow GPS led us here instead of the other one we really wanted to go to- I mean it wasn't bad- but when you were expecting a pan roast with creamy sauce and instead you get a jambalaya looking thing you are a little bummed. Their version of pan roast is completely different and it wasn't until the food came out that I realized we were at the wrong place! No wonder there was no line! However, I must admit I really liked how they sliced the lobster pieces in half so it was easy to eat. :)I held a very mini UYE to try out a new place. 

I got the dolsot bibimbap ($9.95) since it's a favorite dish. Theirs here was decent and the stone pot stays hot. Somehow though it lost its crispness compared to the last dolsot I got. The veggies were fresh and the meat 

The banchan is good here and fresh. We had stewed mushrooms, daikon radish kimchee, napa cabbage kimchee, zuchinni, korean spinach with sesame. Definitely some of the better banchans I've had. Taste more like homemade. 

I heard about the good service here, they were friendly but there really wasn't much service. We ordered, got served and then that was it. No banchan or water refills. We were sitting around and talking and it wasn't til like an hour later asked if people wanted water. I was drinking a Sprite which was empty and I wasn't given water... We walked up and paid. It would have been 4 stars if it wasn't for the non service. 

I would like to come back and try the "star"- the soon tofu and hopefully there will be better service.This place is ok. I got the beef tofu soup and felt like it was pretty plain. Wasn't too salty and doesn't seem like enough tofu. The egg is tossed in for you so be aware of that. The side dishes weren't many compared to some of the other Korean tofu places I've been to. I probably wouldn't come back again. The server was really friendly though and seems like a lot of people know one another here.A group of 4 of us came to Ventano's based upon the reviews on yelp and they were pretty much right on.

The view of the strip in the distance is BY FAR the best attribute of the restaurant.  In fact, they have a patio that would have been nice to have dined on but it was still too cold and windy to do so.  We look forward to coming back and having a glass of wine out there.

However, I'm not sure we will be ordering much food on our next trip as it was just ok.  A bit pricy for what you get too.  Should a 4 inch by 4 inch piece of lasagna served a la carte worth $18.50? The food was good, but a bit bland.  But certainly not like Olive Garden as some have stated.  Much better than that!!!

Like other reviewers stated, the service was good.  And it was quite busy for a Tuesday night as well.

I look forward to coming back to the patio, but just to order wine, appetizers and to enjoy the fantastic view.Good foodFun club, tons of guys, strong drinks. 
Oh yeah, and a great view! 

It's fun to see the old Playboy bunny costumes out. It's very old school glamour and great to see back in Vegas.I came here when Markus Schultz and Ferry Cortsen DJ'd and fuuuuuuh, it was HELLA crowded. The bouncers were not happy that day either. The place is SOOO small, WAY too small to have 2 big DJ's spin. The "dance floor (?)" was PACKED and it had to be 90-100 degrees that day. They should've had those giant misty fans blowing at us or some tents for shade because it was HOT and there were so many people. The pool was mirky, but my best friend was insistant that we go in because it looked "fun." Me, not being too much of a germaphobe and an admirer of fun got in with her and it was not fun. Every time the beat dropped half the people would SPLASH water like mad, they splashed wayyy too much. I suppose it looked fun, but when you're actually in the pool and they're doing that it got quite annoying. I felt like I was drowning from all the splashing because I literally couldn't breath for the 20-30 seconds the splashing went on. Other than that, I would've probably enjoyed this place if it wasn't for so many people crammed into such a small area.The mood for some gourmet pizza led me here on my lunch..

And a couple good with bad happened. You can't just buy a pizza by the slice, they all come 12"- which has a crispy and airy crust, but lacks in amount of ingredients. Could have used more toppings and tomato sauce. Particularly on my pepperoni and sausage pizza- $11.

My Vegetable salad was scrumptious though, plenty of dark greens, corn, cucumbers, and vinaigrette- $7. Juicy, and moderately proportioned. Only took them 10 minutes to get all the food out though. The cafeteria setting is not too appealing, considering the prices.. bill for just myself was $18.

Good- but overpriced! : /Every time we go to the Apple store my kid returns the favor of dragging him along by dragging me to get him a pretzel here.  It is a bit pricey and they always have a very slow moving line, but the product is generally fresh and tasty.Jared:  "Welcome to Subway!  Have you seen my commercial with Michael Strahan?"

Me: "Uh...yes?"

Jared:  "Can I interest you in a sub made with our new rosemary sea salt bread?"

Me: "Sure, that sounds pretty good, actually.  What's Michael Strahan like?"

Jared: "Oh, he's cool.  We're making Subway commercials, you know?  It's not like we were hanging out or anything."

Me:  "Right.  I'll have the meatball marinara with provolone."

"Might I recommend the pepper jack as an alternative?"

"No, I'll stick with the provolone for the meatball sub.  Pepper jack works with the tuna.  They should ease up on the mayo in the tuna, though."

"I'll let them know.  Would you like it toasted?"

"Yes.  So you'll let them know?  Them?  The...Subway people?"

"Yeah.  We've been through some tough times together.  They'll take it to heart coming from me."

"So you're saying they won't take it to heart coming from me?  And what tough times are you talking about?"

"Well you're a customer.  I'm a lifer."

"A lifer?  Was this Subway gig a sentence then?"

"No, I mean a long term commitment sort of lifer."

"So you're like...married to, uh, the Subway people?  What do you call them in private?  Do you make sexual jokes about subs?  Do you?  Cause' that would be wrong."

"No, it's not like that at all.  What toppings would you like?"

"Black olive, tomato, onion and spinach.  Are you ashamed of this relationship?  Is that what it is, cause' it's kind of out there now.  I mean the commercials and everything.  But let's get back to the tough times.  What were those exactly?"

"No, I'm not ashamed.  Look, I lost weight, I did a commercial, then another...you know how these things go."

"Yeah...no I don't know how these things go.  I'm still, uh, waiting for my first spokesperson opportunity...I guess.  How do they go?  Is it like an addiction?  Did you get dumped and hit the subs hard?  Was Subway second best for you?  Have you ever heard the saying "You can get what's second best but it's hard to get enough", is that how this whole thing went down?"

"No!  Whatever man, do you want any mayo or dressings on your freakin' sub?"

"My freakin' sub?"

"Sorry.  I'm really sorry about that.  Do you?"

"No.  And the hard times?  Hmm?"

"Do you want to combo that?"

"No.  Wait, does the combo include a little story about Jared and Subway's troubles?"

"No.  Look, we used to only give like one strand.  Of onion.  Or pepper.  And like one little slice of tomato.  We were really kind of stingy with toppings I guess you could say.  It's not a time we reflect on proudly."

"Yeah, I remember those times.  I would order a veggie sub and sandwich dude would gently lay one strand of green pepper and one thin strand of onion along my sub.  I would be like "more" and he would bust out...another strand.  And I would be like "MORE."  And he would look at me with a strained expression and then he would bust out like two or three strands.  Yeah, those were messed up times."

"Right.  Thanks for coming to Subway!"

"Sure.  Let the, um, Subway people know that things have improved, ok?  I mean the bread is better, there are more and better toppings and you're working on that stingy thing still right?"

"Yeah, I'll pass it along."

"You do that.  And can I get two napkins with this sandwich please?  Thanks."Well, it's Walmart. This one beats the one in El Mirage because the city sales tax is a bit lower so we make the drive here for some shopping.  It has a conveniently located Desert Schools Federal Credit Union if you bank with them. 

One quick tip I can think of is that you can park at the back of the store in their "auto" department area.  Handy when you only have an item or two to pick up...and lets you avoid the zoo that is Walmart.So my friend and I came here to try out a different salon from the one we generally go to located across the street. I kinda felt claustrophobic when I walked in. The place is very narrow and not that big. The salon is well lit and there is a center aisle that takes you from the front all the way to the back of the salon where there is a bathroom and private waxing room. They have ten angled pedicure chairs that are spread out making it not so convenient to talk to your friend. They chairs are angled so you can see a TV (that wasn't even on when we were there) and there are plenty of magazines to choose from at each chair. There are eight nail stations. 

There are not a lot of colors to choose from and I didn't see any Shellac, OPI, or any other gel nail polish brand that is really in right now. Staff was friendly, but of course still talked to each other in their language leaving you insecure and wondering if they are talking about you (because remember you can't really talk to your friend). The place seemed clean, but you really never know with these salons. They don't use liners in their pedicure chairs and the water was obviously dyed blue. 

On the plus, Tom did my pedicure and is amazing at massages and meticulous at color! Five stars for him!I love the food and love the great prices. I love samwhiches as well as the cheese curds they have there that is made locally. What i don't love is the customer service at the Sprouts kitchen, they are always angry, seems like they hate their job and freak out if their are more than 3 orders to make, (imagine if they worked at subway), I go in there multiple times a week only to arrive feeling guilty to put in an order. After waiting a good 10min - 15min i was told they were backed up, which was fine, but the snarky "have you even filled anything out or what" is what definitely turned me off. Its not the sandwich's fault for the service nor is there any other sprouts around, so i suppose I will still have to anger those lovable and courteous ladies in the Kitchen:)Nice place to go for a quick sit-down lunch.  The lunch special (changes daily) is always a good deal and will be extremely filling.  For example, two enchiladas (LARGE ones), rice and beans can be $4.95 with a soda bringing you to $6 and change after tax.  Not bad if you aren't in the mood for drive through or a longer meal at Tia Rosa's.  They'll usually give you chips and salsa too while the owner/cook is at work.  

Standard fare of tacos, enchiladas, burritos throwing it some fajitas and chile rellono too.   The chorizo wasn't too greasy either so thats always a plus in my book.

Not bad for an extremely filling lunch break.  They've started serving beers too with a $2 Corona, Tecate, etc. Happy Hour.We've been going here for the  last three years. It took several visits to find a couple of doctors that were a good fit for us.  They've been great especially since we had an emergency and had to go to ER. They were quick to respond on a Saturday.

Unfortunately, it seems the wait time has been getting worse. The front desk is slow to check in patients.  I was checked in 13 minutes after arriving and 10 minutes after my appointment time. We then had to wait 40 minutes for the doctor. 

Additionally, when making my appointment the phone line was down. I couldn't make it online either. I'm glad it wasn't urgent since there was no way to get hold of them during office hours. 

I left a message for the office manager to address my concerns and haven't heard back.  The doctors are great but with poor office management I might look for a new office.Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their tacos. She loved them. I haven't eaten here in over 5 years. Ordered the sourdough jack and split it with my sister. Decent. Fast service. 

Cons: Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries.I sometimes stop at this Safeway because it is convenient. The reviews I have seen are correct, they need more staff (or) to staff at the appropriate times when it's busy. The lines are always super long and their customer service does lack. I do feel bad saying it lacks as the checker's are normally just as frustrated as the customers due to the never ending lines. 

I did also have a small incident with Pom Pomegranate Seeds (Pom is the brand.) I normally check all my expiration dates on anything that is perishable because there is nothing worse than pulling something from the fridge to eat it and it's gone bad. Anyway, I was in a rush and didn't look when I bought these and of course they had expired the week before. I will give it to the customer service desk, I took both tubs in that i bought the evening before and she promptly gave me my money back. Moral of this story: ALWAYS check your expiration dates. I was pleased with how she handled the return though, she did not give me any push-back which was a nice surprise. 

If the management team can figure out the right number of checkers during certain hours this would definitely help their rating and my frequency for shopping here. 

Sometimes a girl just don't have time to wait in long lines.I tried this place out the first time yesterday - i ordered the chicken enchilada combo with red sauce to go. It was pretty good- I think I will try the steak tacos next time -they look delicious on the sign. I was a little disappointed that they had all of sides in metal containers in the front.. But the rice was fresh so it was ok. Will try them again in the future.I used to be a frequent visitor here when this venue first opened somewhere around 2005, and Shirley was the cook/manager.  She initially started this Filipino eggroll (lumpia) catering business with a partner who decided to move on and leave Shirley to her own devices.  She expanded her business to include a few popular items she'd freshly prepare, rather than serve it buffet-style.  This ensured that the food was low in fat, but high in flavor!  I remember buying fresh pan de sal and baked chicken empanadas.  How I do miss Shirley and her way of doing business.

The new owners (as of 2006), a husband and wife team, do serve tasty dishes.  At least they used to.  It's been over a year since I've last eaten there.  Do go as early in the day as possible to be sure to get the freshest meals.  If you are looking for bargains, do visit before they close, but keep in mind that many items may already be overcooked from sitting under heating lamps/over heating elements.  The meals here are very greasy, but that's pretty much standard about meals served buffet-style (the fat keeps the food from burning).  I used to enjoy the afritada, menudo, and Bicol express.  The lumpia is pretty good, but only if very fresh (that may be more of a personal choice, since I have encountered many people who do not mind eating horrible, soggy pathetic excuses of lumpia).    

One can also find desserts, such as halo-halo, biko, and turon.I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.

I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu, but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good, although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet.I'm not a big fan of Gallagher's overall, but that's primarily because of what it is - a sports bar - which I tend not to frequent, for a couple of reasons: 1. I don't like sports, and 2. they aren't usually very veggie friendly, unless you like salad, which I don't. Gallagher's though, serves up a pretty good veggie burger. You've got a couple of options when ordering - you can either build your own Gallaburger (B.Y.O.G.), or order one of the other burger options and just substitute the veggie patty. There are quite a few to choose from, some better than others, some actually pretty fucking good, like the Baja Burger with jalapeño jack cheese, sliced avocado and fresh salsa (I think this one comes with bacon by default, but from my experience, they're very receptive to mixing and matching, which is nice). Or the Maui Burger with swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce and pineapple salsa.OK.  Not as good as Cold Stone or Sweet Republic.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

Armed with a free "All-you-can-eat for $4.49" Buffet coupon, I whipped into this big Peter Piper for lunch today.  This is still the largest Buffet chain in the Valley, even though they have dropped down from around 65 local locations to 30 now, due to the economic times.  This one was roaring busy today & doesn't look like it's going away!

I started with some of each of their 3 tossed salads...  Garden Ranch, Classic Caesar, & Mandarin Cranberry Vinegarette.  The last one was special, with it's Mandarin Orange sections, cranberries, & sunflower seeds!  Then it was on to tasty hot bread sticks with dipping sauce.

There up to 10 kinds of pizza out at a time & with them coming & going in seconds, everything was fresh & hot.  

Their featured pizza today was called "Extreme Pepperoni", & it was really good!  In fact, it seems that maybe when they raised the price 50 cents recently, they put the money into using better recipes for the pizzas now!  Ok, this is still no BoomBozz, but everything was right about the place, my BOOTH was comfortable (Yeah booths!) & I enjoyed the use of their free open WiFi.  This fun lunch actually nipped at 4 Stars considering all!     :-))

Lunch Buffet $5.49 or $4.49 with coupons that come in the weekly shopper tabloids.So this review is written by a Kansan jaded in Phoenix by a lack of Barbecue.  I was on the hunt for a flavorful smoke explosion in my mouth and found myself here.

Firstly the staff:  This one is always a biggie for me.  I opened the door.  The girl at the front counter was very nice, and I asked her what was the best thing on the menu.  Of course, being a place with ribs on it's name, she suggested the ribs.  I did warn her I was a barbecue snob from Kansas.
Definite points for the kindness and helpfulness of the staff.

Secondly the decor: Typical Barbecue, the place was decorated in all the raw wood and other goods one might expect of a place like this.  The place was very clean, and coming from an ex food service person, I take cleanliness very importantly.  The decor brought it to a homy perspective.

So thirdly, and arguably the most important:  The food.  So let be be plain, when I order barbecue I expect it to shine above the sides.  It should have a rich smoky flavor, that is complimented by whatever seasonings and injections they put in the meat.
I ordered their ribs, and as it comes with two sides, ordered the fried okra and cole slaw as well.  It was suggested that the ribs were delicious.
I took it to go, and on getting home, the food was still hot and the okra still crisp.  (The okra was delicious, the breading really did it wonders!)
I cut off a couple ribs and bit into them.  Instantly I felt like I was biting into a bit of pork medallion which had been baked in an oven, then slathered with a bit of sauce.  The lack of smoke ring and flavor made it evident how these ribs were made.  I would be shocked if these ribs ever saw the inside of a smoker.  The meat was not bad, despite being a bit bland, but it definitely was not aces.

And thus this barbecue warrior will continue to search.  It may be convenient, but for my dollar, I expect more of a barbecue joint.I had never been to an Arizona Blimpie, so I dropped in here this morning a little after 11 to see wuzup.

This is a good-sized place, seating about 60.  There weren't any booths, but the table seating & the dining room overall were comfortable & pleasant, with the place getting rather busy by 11:20.

I ordered a 12" Hot Pastrami on Whole Wheat ($8.09).  It came with slices of Swiss Cheese onboard & the open face may have been dipped just quickly, at least on one side.

This place is no Capriotti's, but my sub and the service were both "A-OK".     :-)

Open Monday through Friday.This is a fun place to go and have a little competitive fun. My boyfriend and I enjoy going here for some mid-day adult time without the kids. It is a little pricy but still fun just the same. I like that they give you a printout at the end of every race so you can see your lap times compared to the other racers. Every once in a while you get some jack a** who slams you into the walls but ehhh what can you do, there're everywhere!!Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine.

However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence.First time I played bingo at in Arizona. I like how the smoking and non smoking rooms are separated, they have a casino shuttle, and there is a Radisson hotel next door. The bad part of the casino are the location is very far out in no where, and the food service and food for the bingo players is okay.I have not had other Chinese or Asian cuisine in the Phoenix area so the review is in comparison to the Bay Area and the reality that there is a relatively small Asian population in the area. The waitress (most likely owner) was really sweet. She recommended a stir fry with bok choi, beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, and shitake mushrooms. Basically the kitchen sink. We also ordered gai lan sauteed with garlic and salty/peppery deep fried chicken. The stir fry and veggies were a bland version of traditional chinese home cooking. The fried chicken which is normally very salty was a mixture of sweet and savory. The cold milk tea was decent. 

As previous posts have mentioned before, the decor is nonexistent. It looks like a Subway with the booth seating except the color palate is pink.The tapioca balls were soft but the iced coffee drink felt like I was slurping Straight SUGAR. Way toooo sweet. :( 

The location is right next to a Chinese supermarket. They have a lot of different flavors (iced tea, slushes, smoothies) but overall nothing that special.

Most of the staff workers looked like high school students.Some of their milk teas are REALLY sweet, I usually end up going home and adding more milk to make it taste better. And I wish they had some specialty teas like other boba joints, everything here is really just the drink with nothing in it, no jelly or fruits at all. Other places usually have some drinks that already have some. I do like their calamari rings, and the workers are friendly.This was my first time experiencing a Dave & Busters. Am I sheltered? Maybe. But mostly, I've avoided them because I simply don't like kids, so when I think of an arcade, potentially with screaming children running around, I break out in hives. 

Recently a buddy of mine told me that they have a good happy hour and also a game special on Wednesdays so I figured I'd give them a shot. 

We spent our time upstairs. This is where the arcade and billiards room is located. You'll know this before even reaching the top of the stairway. There are the deafening sounds of BEEP! BOOP! BEEP BEEP! BOOP! Then as you reach the top... all the flashing lights.

It reminded me of a casino without smoke and with slightly less despair. Any despair that existed, however came from the employees, not so much the patrons. There was about a 50/50 ratio of employees that seemed to completely hate their job, and wanted nothing more than to set the place ablaze. Then the other half who at least attempted to be pleasant. So I would say the quality of hospitality you receive will be a coin flip. 

Back to the Wednesday Special... it's pretty good. The games and even billiards are 1/2 price all day. And I'll give them props on the billiards room, it was nice. 

The Happy Hour was from 4:30-7pm and included  1/2 priced cocktails. I'm more of a beer guy but their beer selection is mediocre at best. Instead I opted for a Key Lime Coconut Margarita. Yeah... I said it. Should I be ashamed? Maybe a little. But it was delicious and honestly an adorable cocktail... I wish I took a pic. I'll take a pic next time. 

For dinner I got the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't hate it. The entrée also included a $10 game card which was cool. There are actually a list of different $16.99 entrees that include the $10 game card. It's a pretty good deal.

I want to add that our server Leah was one of the cool employees. If a manager reads this... she's a keeper. She was on top of her game all night. 

The final verdict is that D&B is what it is. I like it. I don't love it, but a good time can certainly be had. I'll probably be back for some more Happy Hour Key Lime Coconut Margs... no shame. Ok... Maybe a little.My brother placed a delivery order from here last night. He ordered the kung pao chicken, beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing, fried rice, egg rolls, and crab ragoons. I believe they said the delivery time would be about 40 minutes but they delivered it was quicker than that. I tried a little bit of everything except for the eggrolls and it was pretty bland. It wasn't terrible tasting but it didn't make my taste buds dance either. The kung pao chicken wasn't spicy at all which saddened me. My fortune from my cookie read "How dark is dark?" That made me giggle a bit. I gave three stars instead of two for how friendly and fast they were.I've never been a fan of AMC's New York-like prices (matinees aside), but I can't argue with 24 screens smack in the middle of my neighborhood. I'm really surprised this place hasn't been flooded with ASU Downtown students, but hey, I'm not complaining. It's quiet (I've never been to a sold out screening here), it's convenient and parking is validated. 

So, what's the complaint? Well, maybe it's TOO quiet. Sometimes it's just downright creepy, especially when walking in from 3rd Street through the Arizona Center when no one is there. I'm also not satisfied with the service at times, especially during the week when no one is there. I generally feel the place is overstaffed, but I've witnessed a ton of goofing off and some dirty theatresUpside lots of theatres, downside, the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks.  Went to the new Sherlock Holmes film yesterday afternoon.  20 people in line, one staffer, one staffer.  Normally I would use the automated box to buy my ticket, but I had a gold pass.  Don't feel like gold using it though!  This theatre is closest to me, but it drives me nuts when they ask if I want to join their pay for rewards program.  Why would I want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish.  By the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage, validate at the theatre.  They validate longer.  I made the mistake of using validation once from my big Fat Greek and saved a whole dollar.  I repeat one whole dollar.Very tasty and portions were large enough that we took enough leftovers home for lunch the next day for 3 people.  We have found very few non-chain restaurants even worth eating at in this area, so the 3 star rating  is well-earned.  Hard to give it four stars since I would still consider it in the "cheap Chinese food" category and other aspects of the restaurant experience kind of lacking.  We had the lettuce wrap appetizer (was good and almost spoiled the rest of my dinner eating it), Generals Tsao's chicken, kung pao chicken, and chicken chow mein (crunchy not noodle).   We would get any of them again anytime in the mood for casual Chinese food that we could count on for being enjoyable.Shopping for groceries. This is our closest Bashas, so I thought I would add it and review it.

Over all the store is nice, clean and staff is friendly.

The bakery is smaller and seems cluttered next to the Deli area, but bread does seem to be fresh. Deli is good, but be careful sometimes the food sits longer than I would prefer. 

I love there seafood area.

Cold is separated in 2 ares, which is tough if you need cheese and milk, since they are at opposite ends of the store :/This walmart is right next door to me, so I treat it like my walk in closet.  I usually go here for most of the stuff I need.  The staff is helpful and nice.  The store is clean.  They usually process the lines very quickly and have 8 self check out stands.Average mexican. Kind of cute little strip mall and a little above average ambience. It's good food, but not necessarily great food. I would say that it is fairly priced though.

I've been here twice and both times there were some strange smells going down.  Anyone know what that's about? Also - what's the deal with mateo's? is it open? isn't it? what's going on there? i don't understand. Input always welcome!3.5 stars actually.
I've been here before a few years ago and said to myself that I'd like to return and I finally made it back last week.
Sylvia's really does a good job with their chips and salsa-and after all, that's what sort of sets the pace for the meal.  You know the My Nana's tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store?  Same people!
I had the beef tacos lunch plate and they were good, nothing mind blowing, but good.  The rice and beans were not a complete afterthought like some places.  
I'm certain there are better Mexican restaurants but if I'm in the area I would go to Sylvia's again no problem.I dig it. The food was tasty but didn't blow me away. I had the beef and broccoli and the crispy noodles. The service was prompt and the food came out impressively fast even when the dining room was fairly full. It was pretty loud in there and I wish the music was turned down a few notches.Overall: The food is good, not great. For the price the food is better than most at the same cost so I will continue to go here when I'm in the area.

Food Quality: 8/10
 - I did find some frozen peas & carrots in a curry tonight... really!? The other dishes had fresh and they were good. Why skimp on the curry?

Food Flavor: 7/10
 - the Tom soups are very good, some of the best I've had anywhere. The Garlic Shrimp was very good also. The curry dishes and other standard entrees are average.

Service: 8/10
-  Not overly attentive but I've been happy and never had a problem. The people are very nice.

Decor: 6/10
- nothing special but you don't go here for the decor anyway.I had a coupon for "the works" carwash.  They did a fine job, especially considering I got a big discount.  I liked the job they did on the interior.  It's probably the cleanest the inside of my car could be without getting a full detail.  The exterior really isn't any better than any gas station or drive thru carwash.  Still some schmutz all over the font.  I couldn't have hit all those bugs on just the ride home.3.5 Stars

I've been going to Freed's for over a year now. They have vast assortment of cookies, pastries, cakes, cupcakes etc. I think they are probably known for their cookies and cakes, so if you're looking for a cupcake head up a block to The Cupcakery.

The cookies are fabulous. They have all sorts of cookies, and they are truly wonderful - Minus the standard chocolate chip. They are a bit over-baked in my opinion. They are a quite expensive! It's around $18 for a dozen of cookies. 

I haven't had a cake slice or cupcake from them since my first trip, and honestly I can't remember how it was. That to me usually means it not worth trying again. I don't remember them being bad, just forgettable so probably something similar to the bakery at Smith's.

Try it out!I am not sure how to explain my experience at Freemont.  

I'll be brief.  99 cent fried twinkies and fried oreos gave this place 2 stars.  The TV's in the sky gave it 1 star.

That's why this place got 3 stars.  Nothing much else going on here.The Freemont Street Experience is just that, an experience.  Definitely a must see.  I am only giving it three stars because it is Old Town and it is pretty dicey.  Avoid the Glitter Gulch and will be fine!  Also always ask for the extra shot in your 13 dollar margarita, it is well worth it!I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and so I try them where ever I travel, this place has great French bread that they use for their sandwiches and also they are visually appealing in presentation. When you pull into this strip mall do yourself a favor and go to the very last entrance furthest from that way you will end up on the 2nd level the same as the restaurant otherwise you will be climbing the stairs to get your bahn mi.  The overall taste is of the #19 Charbroiled Pork Bahn Mi Was good but not awesome, I don't know what they are missing but I have not found a sandwich yet that touches Ba Le in Chicago......The place smelled fishy when we first walked it.  Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell. It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order. 
We ordered the house special appetizer, one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork. The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave. It looked really good, but we had cancelled and send it back. I don't know if it really takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late. If it does take 40 minutes to make then it shouldn't be an appetizer and it shouldn't be on the menu. The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles. The chow fan noodles with pork  was really good. They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming. I would go back and give them another try. I think we just caught them on a super busy night. The waitstaff was friendly.At least once a month this summer, my brother and I make it out to the Premium Outlets - North. For what reason? Before the Las Vegas Outlets - South had it, BR was one of the main justifications for our northbound journey. 

Now, walking into Banana Republic is like a hot mess, a trainwreck at best. Hectic, poorly recovered, yet what makes it so endearing? Those sales - they're better signed than its southern counterpart. Also, it seems like they have sales that the South outlet store just either doesn't have or doesn't advertise.

I'll brave the crowds and the digging when it comes to fashion. BR holds witness to this...multiple times.I also lived in Italy, but I was a bit disappointed in the gelato.  This was our first trip out to Lake Las Vegas.  It was not that good and it was too pricy for the lack of quality.  The three of us, my husband, our three year old and I, got strawberry and hazelnut.  Cosi cosi, me dispiaca.Its fast food, chicken is ok, burritos are better.If you don't care about staying at a hotel with a casino, this is a nice, budget friendly HGI that is close enough to where you want to be in and around Vegas.

Pros:
free parking, shuttle to airport, malls and Mandalay, decent breakfast (I say decent because my eggs weren't poached correctly but it seems that this is hard for hotels, so whatever), standard HGI rooms.

Cons:
If you drive in late at night, you may have to park on the street or in the sketchy back parking lot. Shuttles do not run very late, so if you're partying on the Strip, expect to cab it back to the hotel.Knocked down to 3.5 stars. The crabcakes aren't the same- it's changed now, it's mostly filler- how disappointing! Very little crab- didn't even finish it. The potatoes were still very good. We won't be ordering the crabcakes here anymore. The maple loaf was very good- that didn't change. From what I've read here, according to other yelpers, the monte cristo is supposed to be really good. The server was very nice, although she was new (a few days on the job) and wasn't sure about our meal coming with the maple loaf. Still an Entertainment coupon participant (already got our new book last month).Relaxed vibe with a classic feel. We were here for a birthday dinner - just the 6 of us girlies. I think that spells trouble because it seemed like we were the loudest ones in the restaurant. Just having a good time out together. 
The service was great and I was confused as to who was our server. It seemed at one point that someone else took over and it was fine. All were very courteous and nice. 
I had the pork tenderloin with some white beans that were a bit on the salty side and some mashed potatoes. The pork was prepared perfectly, but I don't think it was the absolute best I've ever had. We shared the sides...carrots, lemon infused asparagus, potatoes...all were average, nothing really moved me. 
Charlie Palmer's is worth trying. I think for what you pay for, the food should be phenomenal. I just don't think it was. Oh and a couple of the girls had the filet and were not raving about it. I'd really be back for the service, but not so much for the food.They recently remodeled this place and it looks awesome! The only concern I have is, the seating area. I came here for breakfast a few times and stand around for somewhere to sit down.....So I haven't been to a $.99 store in a while.  And I forgot about all the great deals they do have.  Times are tight for just about everyone and a good bargain is sometimes hard to find if you don't look in the right place.  So if you haven't already started looking here every once in a while you might want to start!  They have just about everything here, from plates and dishware to canned food. There is usually one thing you will find even if you aren't really looking.  So the next time you get a chance you might want to take a stroll through and see what you find.I didn't get a chance to walk through the entire mall due to a migraine, but I did check out the Paul Frank store and Zara.  As for what I did see, I was kind of disappointed with the array of stores inside...either the store was located in Texas and I could gladly just shop there at home if I wanted, or the store was way too pricey and there wasn't any point of me going inside just to drool at things I couldn't buy.  The Paul Frank store was much smaller than I expected, and their selection was terrible.

The mall is in a weird location and took forever to walk to, even from my hotel, Harrah's, which isn't that incredibly far away from this location.

I did, however, enjoy sitting on a bench in the air conditioning and drinking a diet Pepsi.Nice indoor mall to take a break from the gambling and the drinking and the shows. The fashion show itself was a blaah but the mall is nice and has some good food options with a california pizza kitchen and a lot of others. They have an underground parking structure which is convenient,  a nice change from the usual Vegas eventsThe menu is very limited; all the food here comes in one color: #cc7722 aka ochre. The chicken strips and crinkle fries are a little better here than at other fast food joints. Psst, the rumor is the secret dipping sauce is a mixture of ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire and spices ... shhh!Is aiight. Good selection on snacks. The fresh donuts are the bomb. Price of gas is average. Blunts are fresh.Pros: Lovely rooms,  great spa prices, awesome pool, free shuttle to the strip, grocery delivery, friendly service. 

Cons: Only 2 places to eat: Denny's and "Tahiti Joe's", kind of far from the strip, can feel isolated if you don't have a car. No casino. Not much to do in the area. 

We traded in a time share for a week at this place and it was an overall pleasant experience! 

This is a nice place to stay if you're going to be in town for a while. They have free grocery delivery that you can arrange to have done when you arrive (it is rather expensive though), or if you have a car there's a Whole Foods nearby. We did not have a car, but we got some groceries and spent most of our time eating out on the strip. A shuttle to the strip leaves every 30 minutes, and it takes about 15 minutes to get there. 

I went to the spa, and had a great, inexpensive massage. The place is modest and no-frills, but the staff is accommodating and friendly and the rooms are comfortable and clean. 

The lazy river is neat!  Unfortunately we went in the winter and the pool was supposed to be on and heated, but it was unseasonably cold so they closed it (jacuzzis were open though).Hello again fellow yelpers!! So me and my boyfriend went to this location a couple nights ago to eat dinner and boy oh boy has the service changed!! Or maybe it was just our waiter, I will give the restaurant the being it of the doubt and say it is just the one waiter. I am going to also give the waiter the benefit of the doubt and not say his name even though I really want to (he he) but we are adults so I will not, nay!! Shan't not haha. 

Anyway so we sat down and the guy was just rude from the start which was fine maybe it was just an isolated incident but oh no not even close. He takes our drink order and as we wait I am looking at the menu and my most favorite dish wasn't on the menu!! So he comes back with our drinks (I got a pot of hot tea) and I ask about the menu item in question he says that no it's not but they will still make it for me so that was really awesome. We said we needed another minute but that I would like some sugar. Without even acknowledging the fact that we said anything to him he just walks away! And just to put the rest of the meal into perspective for you he did this every time we said or ask him anything. So he comes back to take our food order and he never brought me my sugar. I probably sound like a crotchety bitch but I'm sorry I'm not down for paying good money to come eat at your place of work and you treat me like I am an inconvenience of some sort. 

The only reason they are even getting 3 stars is because gosh darn I love there food, it is so delicious every time  and it doesn't treat me like I don't exist lmao. The only reason they lose 2 stars is for that crappy waiter!!! Honestly he was really bad, my boyfriend and I just started laughing about it because he basically took his potentially bomb diggity tip and tossed that shizz straight out tha winda. 

Basically go eat here it is worth it and the food is o'mazing just pray you don't get helped by he who must not be namedThis location was remodeled, the most significant change is the drive thru (at least for me, since I only order through drive thru now). It now has two lanes, which from my experience, surprisingly has quick service. Besides that, nothing significantly different from other Mickey D's.My trips to Williams-Sonoma will never cease. I heart this place and all of the kitchen gadgets it provides me with to oogle at. I actually do purchase things here, but typically I browse, come back, browse again, and then make a hard decision. Mostly because this stuff ain't cheap.

For me W&S is a place to let my inner chef come out and just daydream about the day I WILL OWN THAT EXPENSIVE SPATULA SET.... ahem. As I was saying...

I do like that W&S has a wide range of baking accessories and offers Star Wars cookie cutters, pancake molds, etc. Also they have a decent selection of pots and pans. 

The staff here is usually nice. I have run into the same older women a few times and they are always quick to have a conversation with me. Last time I was here there was kind of an odd guy running the cash register. He wasn't mean, just a little off. I felt awkward just taking my bag and walking away without any conversation or "goodbye".

Anyway, someday I will go to W&S and have my way... until then, daydreams it is.Ate here - food was meh but I shouldn't have been expecting much. They have a great selection of Irish and English beers on tap, and live music on a lot of nights. More of a place to drink than to eat.The place is good. The quality and service is 4/5 stars but the value is pretty low. Unlike older reviews who thought the fish and chips were amazing value, this time they only served 2 small pieces of fish and fries. I asked our waitress about it and she said it used to be 3-4. If you are really hungry order the shepherds pie. It's quality over quantity, also on the pricey side for the size portions you get. $50 for 2 people and no drinks. Guinness is $7.50 on draught.I went here too get new garage door opener for my house. Not make great first impression that for sure. I had too grab salesmen in another section too answer questions and get service. Interesting think that this Sears never really that busy so figure be like car lot salesmen checking up once see you standing in one spot. Anyway I hunt down salesperson the experience got much better. One gentlemen directed me too another salesperson in right section but then she directed me too another person. At the end got the right person knowledgable about his section and answered all my questions professional manner (honest asked about two different brands Sears carried Craftsmen and Genie) not push the higher price tag either way. So after rough start say that if looking for garage door opener Sears good place too check out.Super cheap food for Vegas, I went with a vegan friend who had a couple options here. I wasn't sure if they would because of how small the spot was. Food came up quick and decent. The hummus was nothing to speak of,  a bit bland, but I can't complain too much because the rest of the food was moderate. It is what it is and I wasn't expecting anything different...It's a decent place, not the best and not the worst. It's not really clean, but it's not dirty either. Everything about this place is just OK and average. It's pretty cheap; you do get what you pay for. 

I used to be a regular customer. Duc had been cutting my hair for years for $20-$25 (the price went up a couple years ago), and he used to be fantastic, but for the last few years he's been doing a lazy job and I kept going hoping that this time he would finally cut my hair like he used to, but every time I kept getting disappointed and decided to stop going to him. Not only did he start doing a shotty job, but he started to get really pushy. I was going through a period where I was trying to grow out my hair and so I rarely got it cut, and he kept pressuring me, telling me that I needed to get my hair cut more often or it would look bad. Not really a comfortable situation. 

I did have a few other stylists at Ann's salon cut my hair (I don't remember any of their names) and they were all decent, most of them were very nice. Like I said before, nothing amazing and nothing terrible happened, you get what you pay for.This is a pretty good place to come to for lunch (if you are in the area). The sandwiches are really fresh and healthy. And they are incredibly nice here. They will sometimes give you samples of several different breads. They also offer kids size sandwiches. 

I give it three stars since I feel it is a bit pricey. But I suppose it can be justified with the fresh and healthy part?I can't understand why places like this don't have better happy hour specials, or better hours.  I found myself taking advantage of the nice Samuel Adams Oktoberfest mug deal (more beer for same price I guess) but Guinness and others were a premium price.  I don't think I'm being stingy - Fremont is normally known for better bargains, for thrifty vacationers like myself.  As I noticed the huge Bass Ale light sign outside when leaving I really felt like a tourist who got suckered.  Oh well.  At least my server was pleasant.Serving largely business travelers staying at the game-free Renaissance hotel, Envy is classy and delivers reliably tasty, high-end dishes. Their Mediterranean salad is outstanding - with local honey vinegarette - and the garlic mash is heaven. I don't eat steak so I can't comment there, but their pesto prawns were yummy. They have a decent wine list. And all around great staff and fantastic service!If you can ignore the fact that a miniscule percentage of your hard earned cash will be going to the world's worst carnival barker this is a decent place to stay. 
Slightly off strip, no storm und drang of a casino in the lobby, and if there are a few of you they will give you a decent rate and possibly an upgrade.

I was al ittle miffed that there were no towels in my room when i checked in and some other guys underpants were still lying in the bathroom floor.Overall the food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Enoteca loses a star because when I asked for no onions on my pizza, the waiter said it would be rude to even ask because Chef Marco wants them in there. I countered that I didn't care and still didn't want the onions... of course the pizza was covered in onions when it arrived 15 minutes later.Being a huge fan of Mario Batali and his two LA restaurants Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza, I was so excited to try his new restaurant at the Venetian. The squash blossoms were bland and under-seasoned, a big let down since the squash blossoms at Pizzeria Mozza are absolutely amazing. The fried prosciutto meatballs were decent. I ordered the bucatini with cured ham. The flavor was very good, but just incredibly waaaay too salty for one to eat and that's considering that I'm known to love salty foods. The anchovy pizza was the same.  All in all, the food was only subpar.  Service was also very slow and our lunch ended up lasting 2 hours long.They have a great shopping center. However, the parking garage is quite far and really not convenient if you need to get to your car for something. I do like the shops and all the restaurants they have here especially Earls Sandwiches which are the best sandwiches ever. They have a thundering water show in the mall and it sucks, don't wait for it.This is very similar to Medieval Times. You are assigned a country to root for and you scream and HOOZAH! every time they come out. You are fed a dinner of tomato soup, chicken with potatoes, broccoli, and a biscuit, and an apple tart thing for dessert. The tomato soup was really good but the rest of the food was mediocre. I remember thoroughly enjoying going to Medieval Times as a kid, but now that I'm older the whole thing has lost its allure. Its definitely more geared towards families with young children. I did enjoy the buff, shirtless men in the show but not enough to go see the show again.Came here during our Vegas trip, saw good reviews on yelp so we decided that we have to try it. The crawfish and the shrimp were fresh but the sauces were just ok.   Both the garlic butter sauce and the house special sauce had way too much garlic on them (my breath smell like garlic for more than 2 days).  The fried cat fish and the soft shell crab weren't that good either, we had better one before.  I think the crawdaddy in San Jose and boiling crab in Orange county have much better food than here.First visit was two days before NYE.  We had lunch.  The Green Papaya salad and the panang curry were both excellent.  Service was good.  Beer was cold.  There was litter on the floors and no one picked it up throughout the lunch period, but other than that it was just fine.   If I lived in Vegas, I would go back and explore the menu a bit more and then I would adjust my review accordingly.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food...btw:  Their Hottest setting is not really very hot.first time trying this place & I had the mushroom melt cheeseburger & skin cleanser juice. I had my order to go.

The burger was good although i wish there was more mushrooms to keep the burger juicy.

The skin cleanser juice surprised me in that it tasted exactly like carrot juice unless that's what it's supposed to taste like. I enjoy fresh juice,but when it tastes like veggies, which i'm not a huge veggie eater i don't personally enjoy it.

I'll try this place out again.I had the brisket & pastrami. most ny type deli's will cost you as you know deli's are never Cheap but this one offers a big sandwich that taste great and will not send you to the penny slots after you pay the bill. The soup was good I will be backI had the gumbo here which I would not recommend. Also, I cringe a little when I see the oysters are pre-shucked and sitting on ice. They do have a nice 1 1/2 pound crab leg special for $16 and change, which.. is about the average price on the menu so probably should have gone with that. My wife had a seared tuna ceasar and it was made well.My bedroom closet is bigger than this store! But fun place to shop. I was visiting Vegas, had won a good chunk of change and money was burning a hole in my pocket. The staff was friendly and helpful, but I think Neimans and Nordstrom have a better selection.Since I've moved up to Vegas, I've been coming here for a while.  I usually come here if there's an excuse to.  I don't necessarily hate this place, I just don't put this place on the top of my list.  It's just ok.  In past visits, I enjoyed the fried rice, katsu and other dishes similar to them.  The food is good, not great.  I think a lot of locals enjoy this place because it's always busy.  The prices are overall, good.

What keeps me coming back though is the spam hand roll for $0.99.  As stated in my profile name, I'm a huge Spam Eater.  Sometimes, I'm not in the mood for a whole musubi, just something small and the spam hand roll is perfect.  Small strips of spam, rolled into a small sushi, with a teriyaki soy sauce.  I enjoy it, but I can't really have a lot of it.  The soy sauce is super salty and gives me a headache after three hand rolls.  That still doesn't stop me from coming back for more.  For me, it's the only reason I still consider going there and haven't NOT gotten it at every visit (if that makes sense lol).

If you visit this place, I'm sure you will appreciate the variety of Asian cuisine offered here.  There's Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian local food BRAH!  It's a small place located on a super busy intersection.  When you visit this place, be sure to grab a table right away.  It's first come, first serve and always busy.  Be prepared to wait just a little bit.Huge, clean bowling alley with a multitude of lanes (over 60, I believe.)  Games get cheaper later at night, I think after 10pm.  There were a few communication issues with the guy working the cash register as we tried to pay for games.  He was in a pretty bad mood.  We didn't let that get in the way of having a good time, though.I know, seeing a movie while you're IN Vegas?! What can I say, I just can't get away from it! :)

I agree with other reviewers, this place isn't the easiest to spot. The cab driver didn't even know where it was off hand, so we had to use the GPS for it. You definitely won't see it directly off the strip itself, but once you've been there and found it, I doubt you'll miss it next time. 

The theather itself is alright. Prices are what I've seen back home, so nothing surprising there. Personally, I like stadium seating and they didn't seem to have it here, which is ok but not my preference. It works if you want to get away from the "typical" activities you do on the strip.I have to give this place only three stars b/c most of their food is quite bland to me.  Personally, Panera Bread kicks their ass all day but we don't have Panera in the valley, sadly.  I do like this place for namely three reasons: the fire roasted tomato soup, the walnut chicken salad sandwich and the chocolate chip cookies they give you when you order food!   I do try new things on the menu but seem to find myself let down.   All in all most locations are clean. 

I am still dreaming of a day when Panera Bread comes to the Valley!I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!

At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always "something Asian". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us. 

So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word "pho" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me. 

Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be "out" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.

Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say "excuse me" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.

We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell "cheeseburger" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills. 

I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school "beef and rice noodle" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.

The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in. 

I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.

The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.

I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact "snow bubble milk tea" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the "McDonald's Choke" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.

[Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted. Yay self-censoring!]Very different building. Cool vibe. Food was good but pricey for what you get.Been here multiple times before. The most important memory: first time I ever had creme brûlée.

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.

The restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.

Environment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.

Waiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.

Food: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.


Drinks: only water. Sorry.

Recommendation: EAT!This is a casual restaurant with patio seating in the Miracle Mile shops.  We came here for the $5.99 lunch specials.  I had the blackened tilapia and my husband had the buffalo chicken wrap.  Both were good, especially for the price.  Our server, Carlos, was very attentive and came by several times to check on us.  If you're looking for a cheap place to grab lunch, this is a great option.Came here on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I didn't stay long.  I had an OK time and at the moment, other places really suaded me otherwise.

The place is dark and filled with Asian decor and influence.  It's located in the middle of a Chinatown strip mall with one of my favorite Pho restaurants, Pho Kim Long.  I was baffled as to why there was bouncer, since we were the only reason the place was busy.  There's a bunch of couch seating in the back creating an intimate setting for a small party.  Unfortunately there was no food and I was super hungry :(

The bar was filled with TVs and LOTS of seating.  There was also a DJ there doing Karate Karaoke which helped liven up the crowd.

I had an OK evening.  Unfortunately that might not be enough for me to consider this place in the future.  Chinatown is filled with little jems and I don't really consider this place on that list.  If you're looking for a venue to hold a party and not looking to get an upfront charge to save the space, maybe this place is perfect!I love this place! There are a few items on the menu that aren't very good, however, that's why my rating is average. And I'm Filipina. 

I would order the cheaper 6-piece bucket, it's more worth your money! Split it between your family or something. I love the chicken, the sweet potato fries, and the banana langka dessert pie--much better than the peach mango, in my opinion. Jollibee is pretty satisfying for Filipino fast food, I'm likely coming back, I'm way too Filipina not to.I saw this place on PBS "Check Please, AZ" and decided to give it a try.  It's in a corner of a little strip mall and you can sit outside if you like.  I'll just say "it's OK".  We ordered the breakfast brioche egg sandwich and a cinnamon roll.  The brioche bread was very fresh (so soft it felt like you were eating air).  Although I liked the sandwich, it could have used something . . . some salt and pepper perhaps?  It just didn't taste like much.  The cinnamon roll itself was good, but had way too much frosting for our liking (it was swimming in frosting and we had to scrape some off).  And I wish it had some walnuts.  The service was good and prices were reasonable.  But I agree with some of the other yelper's . . . stop using plastic plates (not good for the environment).  I don't think I'd drive out of my way to come back.Very, very nice and customer friendly owners gets this place 3 stars, but on food alone I give it 1.5 stars.  Though it's nice to have a Korean place so close by, Jun's House food isn't what real Korean food should taste like.  First, shitake mushrooms should be reserved for just a few dishes since they're so pungent.  However, Jun's seems to place it in many dishes (including the yuk-hae-jang, or beef and veggie soup) which is a big big BIG mistake.  Instead of a spicy, savory soup, all you taste is shitake mushrooms.  The banchan (side dishes) are subpar as well, esp. the kimchi (bland and sad).  And don't get me started on the kimchi soup.  Using "raw" kimchi in kimchi soup is unheard of...I had no idea why it was so strangely sweet until I called my mother to ask.  And lettuce in the bibimbap?  Just weird.  But the BBQ is decent so if that's what you're looking for, Jun's shouldn't disappoint.  Jun's food made me grumpy and now I'm grumpier because I'm posting my first negative review.  Thanks a lot, Jun's house.So I'm not a HUGE coffee fan although I have started the foray into liking it more. I'm really more into it for the social factor (Imagine that...)

The Coffee Bean is a great place to come and chat with friends...I love to sit in the leather seats and have a Decaf English Breakfast Latte and a Bagel. I usually go with one of my good friends after we drop the kiddos off to school. 

Don't get too close to us though as we are knee deep in an argument over politics. She wears her vote emblazoned across her chest while I berate her for the hour or so we get together. We always leave arm and arm with a big hug though and usually have someone take our photo to update the caller ID in our phones. 

Who is wearing which shirt...Well I won't say of course but come down one day you'll see us there and then you figure it out...she's the tall gorgeous blonde, I'm the buxom depending on the day can't figure out what color my hair is :)well not that our experience was horrible but this gal must have been new she brought me the wrong breakfast she did not seam to know if toast came with my wife's breakfast, though she was very nice there was no offer of compensation for her and or the kitchen staffs screw ups and we did not get our side of fruit which is shown on the menu to come with our meals. the side of gravy i ordered was cold by the time my breakfast showed up the second time. 3 stars are being generousI like this mall, I do. There's downsides, like every mall, but it's cleaner than the Meadows, not as touristy as the Las Vegas Outlets (eh.. they keep changing the name on this one. I think it's gone from Bellz to Las Vegas Outlets now to Premium Outlets - South. lol), certainly not as pretentious or crowded as Fashion Show, and not subject to Las Vegas weather like the Premium Outlets (North? lol). 

There's gangs of teenagers roaming around, but they're really not a bother. The stores are a mixture of high end and regular ol' department stores. The food court is average, the place is generally clean. What can I say? Just average in my book, but convenient to my house and somewhere I'll go when I need something from the mall I can't get anywhere else. A-Ok.First off, I only review burgers.  Heard from my friend Yohan that this place had a pretty dang good burger so I went to verify with my non-burger loving mother again.  She ended up getting a salad this time and seemed to enjoy it.  My burger was pretty plain.  No frills.  That being said, the patty was seasoned enough so that it didn't need a lot of help in the condiments department.  That being said, while it was good, I don't think I would crave it unless I already happened to be in the Paris hotel and casino.

WHAT I ORDERED: 

Le POULET (salad) - 3/5 pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular

Le CLASSIQUE (burger) - 3/5 solid patty, adding a special sauce might push it to 4/5

Sweet Potato Fries - 4/5 how can you go wrong with these?

STAFF:
Exceptional.  Our waitress was attentive and genuinely sweet.

WAIT TIME:
No wait time Saturday around 6:30pm

PORTION: 
Hearty sized burger.

BANG FOR YOUR BUCK 
The portions and quality of burger match the price well.

WOULD I RETURN 
Probably notLike other reviewers have mentioned, try not to go on a Sunday if you have a groupon. This particular waitress didn't honor it and my friends who had the groupon didn't want to keep pushing it. Anyway, I had the veggie burger (wasn't really feeling in the meat mode) and it was pretty good. However would I pay $12 for that plus $5 for waffle fries again? Probably not. We just came here for my friends groupon and because they wanted to watch some games.We've eaten here several times over the past year.  We visited again on 3/29/2014 and were very disappointed to see that the menu had been changed... and NOT for the better.  Our favorite item was the kobe beef burger which was no longer on the menu.  After checking with someone, our server said they could still prepare one.  It was delicious as usual but I have to wonder just how long it will be available.  As for the actual menu itself, it was not clear and easily understandable.  Compared to their previous menu (still viewable on their web site), it's a major step backward.  The old menu very concisely laid out all the burger choices in a very easy to read format.  Another item of concern is the shakes.  If I understood correctly, all the shakes now contain alcohol.  I get the fact that this is a sports bar but this change is certainly not for everyone.Why the changes guys?

The food server was very good and extremely professional.  The atmosphere was very good as well.  This would easily have been a 5 star review except for the items noted.

As an aside, as Caesars Seven Star members, we have always been offered little sample size shakes on each visit.  That was a very nice touch and very much appreciated.  Alas, apparently this practice no longer exists.  Must be because of the alcohol.  

We'll try it again but a I have the  feeling that our days at Le Burger are coming to an end.Uh. I certainly wouldn't eat dinner here, but breakfast was fine and lovely. I chose from the benedict section and husband had the scramble.   Service was quick and friendly... probably should have walked over to Paris for some crepes but dammit, my feet hurt....  

The breakfasts surrounding us all appeared tasty and of good quality!  Of all things, what I enjoyed the most was the man enjoying a glass of what was probably scotch and breakfast.  I love Vegas.Ok for after clubbing food. Our waitress was happy and friendly.We ate here twice during our stay at the Planet Hollywood hotel.  The prices were more reasonable than the buffet or the steak house or Koi.  

Both times the food came out INCREDIBLY slowly!!!  The first time we ate there was late night after the 9:30pm Peep Show let out and there was nobody in the place.  This was on a weeknight too.  No excuse for it.  

The waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there.  She was not very friendly.  Left me with an empty soft drink glass for a long time.  

The second time we went there was around 11:30am.  It was busy.  Still took REALLY long time to get the food up.  This time though our waiter was great.  Bronson was his name.  He engaged us in conversation, made us all smile, and even laughed at my dad's jokes.  My husband is very picky with what he orders and Bronson was very patient with his indecisiveness as well.

The food itself was not bad.   I'd say average, but all and all I would have given this place a poor rating had it not been for Bronson.Every casino has their standard cafe and this is Planet Hollywood's.  The food choices were good, ranging from standard American dishes to Asian foods.  The sandwiches offer the best value being cheap and large.  Nothing fancy here, but one of the better casino cafe.Always excited to see a new place open, I tried this one the first week in.

Now granted, probably the first month of a restaurant opening is crazy until all of the kinks are worked out of it.  I do take that into account.

The first thing I noticed was that there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated, and half of the booths and tables were empty.  The teeny bopper hostesses (I have never seen three hostesses before, especially in the morning) were behind the counter chatting and talking badly about some of the customers.  In addition, there were lots of wait staff just hanging out in different areas.  Even if you're waiting for a table to serve, you probably shouldn't just stand there with your finger up your nose in the middle of the dining area.  At least pretend to be busy.

Finally, we were seated after a 20 minute wait.

The breakfast menu is pretty decent, various omelets, pancakes and waffles with a Hawaiian theme.  I had the Maui Jim's Crab Cakes Benedict.  Yeah yeah, I know, eggs benedict again?  I'm always in search of a good one.

The waitress was pretty nice, but the food was a little slow.  Seriously, eggs benedict shouldn't take long, if a kitchen is prepped properly, crab cakes or not.  The coffee was a little watered down too.

The hollandaise sauce tasted right out of a package, a little powdery gritty with a little too much lemon.  Trying to hide that package flavor eh?  One egg was slightly overcooked while the other one was extremely runny.  Er..not even sure how that could happen, they were the same size.  The crab cakes were nothing to scream about either.

Just a note:  If you ever want a bone in ham, you need to actually see the bone in.  Maui Grille's "bone in ham" is actually a processed piece of meat, and pretty pricey for fake meat.

So in conclusion, the food and service was average, and not really worth the price.  The smidgen of a plus was the design of the building.  The entire center of the restaurant opened up into a sun filled patio with a little water feature in the center. 

I may go again to try out lunch or dinner.  Maybe it's better then.Switch has some pricier menu items, but is pretty good happy hour/ brunch location.   Spacious patio in back, friendly servers, etc. .  Best things about this place: Froofroo drinks, Fruit, Fries, and Free Internet.    

Froofroodrinks:  Refreshing and cheap.  The Sangria and mojito- vodka cocktail that I cant remember the name of right now, are great.  They are 1/2 price druring happy hour, which I believe is before 6:30 pm....then beer is half priced.   Brunch on weekends -- $1 cocktails.  nice. 

Fruit:  Fresh fruit can be found in every section of the menu; sangria chicken sandwiches and salads (with grapes and feta) ... Berry Turkey Sandwiches..etc...  The drinks come with oranges and strawberries and grapes.  they should start infusing the fruit with liqour.  that would be even better.

Fries:  Switch has amazing fries.  Plump, seasoned and oven roasted potato wedges are a steal at 3 bucks.  They go great at the froofroo happy hour.

Free Internet: Also great for the froofroo drinks happy hour.

Sunday Brunch
I recently went to the brunch with my manfriend, mostly for the amazing drink specials.   $1 screwdrivers, bloodymarys and mimosas, oh my.  It lasts till 3pm, which is also a huge plus.  The brunch menu isn't too exciting, and, likethe rest of the menu, pricier than it should be.  Also, the proatoes tasted like they had been cooked 3 days prior.  


Overall, Switch is a great place to split food with someone and spend the rest on drinks.  Especially if it is 2:00 on a Sunday.prob should get 3 1/2 stars.

Liked.. not loved.

Very classy looking place. Swankie. Kind of place to bring a date, or your woman, or sig other, or.. whatever you got.

Liked the wall with the pillows.  Nice lighting. This place would get a 5 for the looks.

Food was ok.  Again liked not loved.  Had Calamari that was good. I had a pork chop with apricot glaze that was very good. My womans pasta was great.

I can't explain why this place should not get at least 4 stars. The service was a little slow, but I could care less about that.  I will always take great food over service... but this place and the food and everything was just missing something. Not sure what, but for me at least... the "it" feeling of love I have with so many restaurants just wasn't there.$5.95 for a 2 item combo plate with rice. You cannot substitute rice with pancit.  Additional entree is $2.95....

I had the Adobong Pusit and barbecue grilled chicken. It was pretty good, but Adobong Pusit had too much oil.  I prefer Filipino food with less oil, but kind of hard to find since fat and oil is part of the culture...

Kapit Bahay is in the same hood as my office, so I would come back if I feel too lazy to drive up the street to Nanay Gloria's, want to spend the same price as Nanay's AYCE buffet and prefer more oil.On the woman's side of the spa the attendants  were lacking and food and drink service was near non existent. They have no cafe or assigned pool waitress. If you want great service see Eugene and he will make sure you are taken care of.Stopped in here for breakfast this morning.  Place was not very busy around 7AM.  I got the special posted for the day consisting of 3 eggs, 1 each bacon ham sausage, hash browns (or home fries), toast (or biscuit).  Total with decaf and tax came to $9.83.

Good points:
I like the decor, especially the color scheme.
There was plenty of food for the price.
Josh gave me excellent service, most of the time.
There was not a long wait for the food and it was all hot.

Stuff that could use some work:
While Josh directly gave all his customers great service I do not think the whole dining room needed to know about the steak that was served way over done or what mess the closing shift left him, He should be a bit more discreet talking to the rest of the staff rather than shouting.
I was drinking decaf and there was no marker under the cup so the other waiter almost added regular coffee to my cup.

Overall it was an OK place to go.I've never STAYED at Bill's...although it does look like they've spiffed the place up since it was Barbary Coast.  I had been in BC a few times to play the cheaper tables over the years, but there wasn't any real draw for me to go there for any other reason.
Bill's probably wouldn't have any appeal to me either...but they made the smart move and hired Big Elvis.  If you haven't seen this guy you're missing out.  He's great.  Good interaction with the crowd and AMAZING voice.  He's still a big guy, but apparently he's lost a shit load of weight, and he talks about that quite a bit - very inspiring guy.  He plays 3 shows during the day on weekdays.  
Go check him out in the lounge.  Two thumbs up!  :)Went here a few weeks ago while visiting the Mesa area for business.  I was really hopeful that it would be the best, but it was just OK.  I got a Chicken Chimichanga with rice/beans and like I said, it was just OK.  The limeade was great, but the food left me looking for more.  We did get to sit outside in the 65 degree weather which was a nice change for me from 25 degree Utah at the time.  That was the best part for me.I'm not a huge club fan so I will say I probably won't give the best review.  Here it goes.  It's to damn DARK in this, walls, floor, doors, bar and stage all painted black.  Must of been a sale at Home Depot on black paint.  They also have nothing to deflect sound so the sound bounces off the bare black walls.  Unpleasant experience, except for a couple of years ago I worked for Taco Bell and their food truck sat in front and we passed out free food... now that was fun.  :-)  BTW, I don't work for taco bell so don't try and hit me up for free food.Lots of places to eat in this complex! That said, the theatre itself is so-so. My bad for going to see The Campaign on a Sunday afternoon at the end of its run: cue a group of seven 13-year-old boys who only got in on the whim of their parents' liberal parenting methodologies. 

If there's nothing I love more than gay/butt jokes, it's having them occur for a constant one-and-a-half hour stream, in a dark theatre, where it would be socially inappropriate to leverage physical disruption of their ability to speak. 

Managers, check in on your theaters every now and then. Spare your patrons the hypertension, or at least equip mature-looking audience members with tasers.It's a very spacious saloon with lots of TVs.  Probably a good place to watch the games on Sunday.  I've been in several times for takeout.  Service is always good.  Food quality is below-average, (not terrible, but just not up to the level of the typical pub grub).  Wings and onion rings are great.  They do have a punch card program that gets you a free meal after buying 4.Sushi, I'm sorry but I'm just not that into you.. Seaweed (yuck), raw fish (cringe), and huge bites at a time (gag).. but I digress.. 

My other half has a deep love for sushi (and most things Asian for that matter, haha) so I like to be a good sport and attend these all you can eat feeding frenzies whenever the suggestion is made; it's me compromising ;) 

Not located in the greatest parts of town, we entered the somewhat warm establishment. We were greeted right away and sat with a quickness. The server took quite a while taking our drink order and didn't express much in the way of personality. 

The music was quite eclectic, Asian techno, to indie music, to um..??? The decor was bland, much like the chicken dish I ordered but the cucumber salad was sort of redeeming really, how can you screw up cucumber salad anyway, right? 

The other half enjoyed one roll (I forgot which one) out of (I lost count), several and stated that a return visit wouldn't necessary be in the cards. Not that the food or service was so terrible, but that there are plenty of other, "better" choices out there for sushi. 

I give this joint 3-stars because it wasn't terrible and it was about as fantastic as an inexpensive sushi place could be to a non-sushi lover. 

Best part: cucumber salad and price 

Try it, or don't..whatevs ;)I've only been here one time, and they DO honor the 25% off with Nevada ID and LVH players card. (At least, they did in January.)

This restaurant is lovely...small and cosy, with kind of a romantic atmosphere.

I received my very own cast iron teapot for my hot tea, which was awesome. 

The pot stickers were tasty.

But what I LOVED was the Pacific Seafood Noodle Soup. 
Scallops, Sea Bass, and Shrimp in the most fragrant and delicate broth, with tender noodles...truth be told, if they ran out of the seafood pieces and only had the broth it had been in...I'd eat it.  

It was a great experience.  I'd go back, for sure.  My only complaint was that it was kind of chilly in the dining area...but it WAS January, and I don't think I had a sweater with me.Phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious!  Service without a smile sucks though.If I was voting on beer selection this place would be a 5. They have a large selection of reasonably priced drafts and they change weekly brining in new and different beers to try. 

I can also say most of the servers are very good. I come every week for trivia on tuesdays and the service is always good, nobody has any problem with splitting tabs for the 6 or so people we have every week. I never go long with out a drink or waiting to order. It is a very well run crew.

Now for the bad the food is very hit or miss and even the hits aren't that exciting. Since I am here on tuesdays I often get appetizers as they are half off. Some like the southwestern or apple/pear quesadillas are good and a solid amount of food. Others like the pizza wheels are barely edible. I have had some of the regular menu items and they often suffer from being bland or over salted. Some recommendations of mine on stuff to get include the california carver burger or pizza, the hummus appetizer, and the tatonka burger. 

Also costing them points is bad AC and that the bathroom may be one of the worst I have seen in an otherwise decent place. They have a horrible hand dryer that isn't high flow or hot and they don't have paper towels as an option. The door to the toilet doesn't have any lock and swings open on it's own.

If you want a place to have fun drinking and playing trivia you can do worse than here. Just be careful with the food selections and don't get your hopes up.It's out of my hood, but had to check it out anyway.  While waiting for a friend, I sat at the bar next to a gentleman that had recently been cut off.  Instead of asking him to leave, he hung around telling everyone how he had been cut off - and by everyone I mean anyone sitting at the bar and anyone that would answer his phone call. (He was obviously a regular - every bar has at least 1 of those, if you know what I mean)  I know the "you have 30 minutes to secure a ride rule", but his friends were there to take him, which means the 30 minutes does not apply.  Anyway, once I got a bartender's attention the service was good.  They were training someone new and she was very nice and polite.  

I was told to order one of the hot pretzels so that's what I did.  Holy CRAP!  The sauce was not what I was expecting....it was every better!  I didn't have time to try anything else, but I will be back with my friend to try some other items.  The pricing wasn't bad, there were sports on the TV and there is a smoking patio.  Coolest thing:  TV's in the booths!Average. Ordinary. Not bad but not special, and prices are in the 15 to 25 average. Overcooked shrimp, salty crab legs, OK fish fry. Service OK. I have had a better meal at Red Lobster. Sides are ordinary. And not special either. Red beans are watery and seemed like from a can, not Louisiana style. Very limited tap beer selection. Some decent wine prices by the bottle, by the glass expensive. Nothing special on the wine list.Well I had fun here but most people will think it sucks. I'll start with the negatives: It's small, older crowd, whatever music, expensive drinks (its at the Wynn).
Positives: Small and intimate, older crowd (you can actually be social), very low profile. 
Again, if your looking for the mega vegas experience and seek an uber-club, dont come here. If you're looking for a no frills experience, this is it.Food is sub par, but the drinks and patio are perfect.  Even on a semi-chilly March afternoon, being outdoors and out of the casinos is a much needed change of pace.

Four of us stopped in for an afternoon intermission that led to the remaining day and night's chaos.  If you don't want something too sweet, try the Honi Honi, a mix of bourbon and juices served in a cup illustrating some pretty interesting "positions".

If you want front row people watching, grab a seat at the edge of the patio and you can watch "America" walk right by.Jasmine Thai is just OK Thai food in my opinion.  My girlfriend thinks it's a lot better than I do.  I hadn't had Jasmine in awhile, so I grabbed a GC off of restaurant.com and we went there for dinner tonight.  We had to spend $35, so we ordered 2 appetizers: the crab rangoon (awesome) and the chicken satays (disappointing).  I had the pad thai, which I didn't find as good as Thai Taste, where I usually go.  My girlfriend had the pad se eu, and I tried it and liked that a lot better than my dish.  We also had a large thai iced tea to get us up to $35.  Good meal, yeah, but I'd personally rather go elsewhere for Thai.This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay. 

So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting. 

One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.

I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.

The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest.
Bonus: they accept credit cards, which most grungy dives do not.I really, really, really wanted to like this place. Really. In fact before I even knew much about it as a restaurant, every time I passed it in Mandalay Bay I thought it was so cool how they had this towering wine cellar. I loved the exterior decor and what little I could peek into the interior. Five years in the making and finally I got to eat here.

Sigh. Maybe I hyped it too much myself? It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong? 

Well, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes? 

They also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?

The only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines. What's the point if you're just going to stock it with 100 bottles of the same wine with no room for others?

Overall, it wasn't worth the money and I don't see how it was worth the Michelin star.It was fine.Typical outdoor Mexican place.Niceview of the strip from the upper bar where we sat.It was hot out that day and I was tired so maybe I wasn't enthused enough to enjoy it.Friendly folks and the Jager girls were out that day giving away free stuff if you bought a Jager shot.This place actually deserves 3 1/2 stars.  I went to the one located on Tatum Blvd.  It use to be some other kind of restaurant/game place before.  My husband and I met up with a big group that was visiting from out of town and it was great for that.  They have some good deal where you buy a dinner for a certain amount (i want to say $15.99, but don't hold me on it) and you get a $10 game card.  Not bad, especially if you have a lot of people into playing the games.  We also ended up in the bowling section and had a blast.  Wait staff good and attentive.  Also, a big plus about them...you don't feel like you're being police patrolled...or that someone is going to walk up to you in 5 seconds shining a light in your face with a Breathalyzer just because your on your second drink in an hour and a half.Their sandwich helped me transition quickly from "HUNGover" to food coma + Family Guy episodes.

It didn't taste very good, but it did the trick at a low price.So freaking average. We came here because of all the reviews. We waited in a super long ass line and had a little trouble finding it. All that to get to mediocre sandwiches. I did notice that 90 percent of the line looked like college students. Maybe because it was somewhat affordable is why so many people like it. Otherwise, I don't get it.???Earl of Sandwich is a good spot for a quick bite at all times of the day. The sandwich and the price were on point, but I don't think it lived up to the hype.Not understanding the rave reviews, but it is nice that they're open 24 hours. The sandwiches run about $7, and they're the size of your average Subway 6 incher with slightly more filling. Relative to other Strip food, this is still a bargain. Quality/taste reminded me of Quizno's - good but not 5 stars.Good but not great food.  Friendly service.  Fun place with nice location in Forum Shops.The food was ok. The service was mediocre. The location is a 5 star.It's been 4+ years since my last review of the place; I met friends here for dinner on Saturday night (11/2/13). 

Notes:
+ Full bar menu with decent selection of spirits
- Upcharge for asking for drink(s) with rocks. Additional $2 for ice in spirits

+ Service was excellent and prompt throughout the night
+ Staff was very friendly and accommodating, from front of house to server(s)

+ My friend was able to order something that wasn't on the menu; he wanted a simple spaghetti with red sauce, which they happily made and he reported as excellent
- They charged him $19 for it. Seriously? $19 for spaghetti????

+ Chicken salad was flavorful; lettuce & veggies fresh and crisp
- Very small amount of chicken - maybe 3-ounces
- Salad was $13

+ Pizza was good; Thai Chicken
- Pizza was small and expensive

Seeing a theme here? This place charges as though it was much better than it actually is. Yes, it's decent, but it's not as spectacular as the prices would suggest. The bill for our table of 4, with just one round of drinks was $110, without tip. I struggle with that...First of all, I will say it's not a real spa atmosphere when you walk through the doors. It looks like a hair salon.  When we walked in there My husband said, did you look this place up before you bought the groupon?. Honestly I didn't because I bought the wrong groupon. So we had no choice but to use it. I will say once I walked in the door to the massage room, it looked cozy and the smell of aromatherapy filled the room. I had a massage by Casey right after my husband so I figured she would be a little weak for another deep tissue back to back.  I will say she did get a few knots out and I feel better today but I felt like I got more of a Swedish than deep tissue. My husband said she was really good and enjoyed it because she took a few of his knots out too. I thought she was okay. Also make a note that you can't add services when you get there.  The lady at front desk said they are short staffed on Monday's so no one was there to do a pedicure.  Would I go back? Probably not because it's far from my house, but if I lived closer no because I like places that give you the real spa experience. I think you should try this place out using a groupon to see if you like it. Based on past reviews customer service has improved!S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.

Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.

So, let's put that into perspective...

I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...

I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience. 

Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.

First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it. 

I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar. 

I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, "How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?"

"You see," I told him. "It was like this..."open 24 hrs, wifi available.  standard pho, nothing spectacular but good enough.  broth on the mild side, noodles fair, meat scored 3 out of 5.  loud Vietnamese-language movies on the big screens all around.  very spacious, with solid furniture."The Place"

You've been "there" with me, haven't you?
You know the place.
The one you go to when you're tired, you're hungry, and there's nothing in the fridge.
You go there when you don't feel like shopping, and take-out or pizza just won't cut it.
So you hit your "go-to" joint.
You know the one.
It's close to home.
It's consistent.
It's reasonably priced.
And they know you there. 
Montana Meat is that place for me.
And I was in that "there" zone two nights ago.
Got my ass a 12oz rib-eye medium with onion rings/french fries, vegies and Scotch.
Scoped out some games on the multiple screens and was waited on to perfection by the dry-sense-of-humor barman.
I like their steaks and Kobe burgers, and the bacon-wrapped scallops hit the spot every so often. The salads are big and the drinks come quickly.
It's good to have a go-to place, me thinks.
Don't you agree?
:)This place is pretty good for a deli. It opens late, it might even be 24 hours because when we were there it was pretty late. We stayed at The Excalibur but the food options there were really sad so we ventured out to Luxor. 

I had the Bagel sandwich with Eggs and Cheese. Jesse had the Veggie panini. Big portions and they hit the spot. The only problem was they didn't put enough seasoning on our dishes. A little dash of salt & pepper will be nice. 

Prices are lower than I expected for Vegas. It's a great people watching spot because it's by one of the hotel elevators. We saw quite a bit of ladies with high heels and almost fell on their asses. Great late night munchies and entertainment for sure.This is your average small airport, its modernized so traffic flow is slick and services are smooth. Not a connections place but a fine starting or final destinationI'm not a fish fan, but the group I was with was, so as long as there's some non-fish on the menu, I'm fine with it.

It's a nice place, and the service was friendly and attentive. The cocktail napkins with incredibly corny fish jokes (where do fish borrow money? a loan shark) was kind of a fun addition.

I ordered a pasta dish which included chicken, peppers, and a creamy tomato-based sauce. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes, but I can't really judge those without trying them.

I've got no complaints, and I'd probably go back if I'm with people that want to go, but I think I can find similar quality food for me at about 4 or 5 dollars less for lunch.I came here for "easy hour" a while back with my ladies and what can I say...

At 5pm on a Friday, business was crazy busy!  We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.  

When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side[my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.

My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by.So I've been back several times and I've tried some other flavors and they do have a weird aftertaste, as in "blech, cough" I need some water to wash it off my mouth!

The tart flavors are pretty good and that's what I'm going to stick with from now on. Plus, is pretty inexpensive and instead of me filling a huge cup to the brim with yogurt, they do the portion control for me.The Beatles are my favorite group of all time, so I expected AMAZING! I had already heard the soundtrack a few times, so I was a huge fan of that specifically going in. I loved that George Harrison composed the whole complication and was super stoked to come. In fact, it was the sole reason I came to Vegas after having not been here since I was 11. I am now 34 and knew that The Beatles would be the only thing to make me go there as an adult. It's true, there seemed to be no bad seats and the overall ambiance was pretty cool looking. We sat like 7 seats from the stage. The shows performance did not match the soundtrack, however. It was lacking in many areas and beyond slow for at least 60% of it. The creepy as all get out little Beatles with blank faces was unnecessary and freaky and the Blackbird scene was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. Totally took away from the beautiful song. There was nothing about the show that was worth $127! That is what the person who bought my ticket paid. It was worth about $80 and that;s what I would pay if I ever went again. I would also never sit near the stage again because I do not enjoy massive sheets dragging over my head for 5 minutes, which is what happens if you sit near the first 20 rows or so. If you went in with a hair style, you will leave those rows void of one. 
Go for the soundtrack and overall show, but don't pay more than $80. 
5 stars for the soundtrack and 3 for the performances.Food is maybe slightly above average in my opinion.  I have always had great service, however.  Reliable place to go if you're in the area.  It makes my husband's trips to Fry's Electronics across the street more tolerable for me.  Last time we went, we were seated in a separate building on the other side of the patio.  Was very nice and relatively quiet.  I'm not overly fond of the patio since Baseline is so busy.

I do prefer the Aunt Chilada's on Dreamy Draw-both the food and the atmosphere.  But I'm sure I'll be back to this location again.  Damn computer geeks.If you can get in for cheap, like less than $30, and got nothing else to do, then it's OK and entertaining.  The girls are not that hot.  But it's cheaper than other forms of topless dancing...  

I did like the bungee dance.  

My show's comedian was so so.  People laughed a little, but most of it was make up on the spot, about where people are from, etc.. basic stuff.It's all about perspective: if this is your first time staying in Las Vegas or 1st time staying in one of the nicer hotels, you will think that the Palazzo is awesome.  Yes, you get the multiple flat screen televisions, decent beds, marble bathrooms.  On the other hand, if you have stayed at the Wynn or the Bellagio, you will be disappointed.  For a Girls' Weekend Getatway, 10 of us chose the Palazzo (prestige) because it offered all suites. We, of course, wanted to have a great time, common areas where we could all commune in (drink, dance, do makeovers, whatever).  The layout of the Bella suites is odd in that you walk into and through the bedroom to get to the living room. I've never seen that before. That wasn't a big deal though.  The two things that are hilarious / annoying is the technology.  Evidently, when the last Holiday inn closed down, the Palazzo ran their cheap asses down to the auction to buy all of that hotel's old crap.  The telephones in the room will qualify as antiques. No exaggeration (will post pics).  There is also a huge, 1980-style fax machine for your use. No huge deal--with a shot or two of tequila, they came a huge running joke. BUT--the big deal for us was that there is no place to plug in your Ipod.  I travel a lot. Even the basic hotels, now have an alarm clock that you can set your ipod on. They have a spot for you to play a CD --really? a cd? hell, why not an 8-track? It's 2012 folks at Palazzo. 30% of people Nationwide use ipods.That statistic is even greater when you just factor in people who take at least one vacation per year.  An ipod dock is a standard amenity that travelers have come to expect--particularly travelers who are possibly coming to party with friends.  To their credit, the Palazzo was nice enough to allow us to rent a huge boombox for $35 a day. So, on top of our $469 room, we had to add $35 a day to be able to listen to a little Rhianna while we got dressed to go dancing at night.  David, the manager with whom I spoke at the Palazzo thought that this was absolutely fair.  Really, David? Penny-wise, pound-foolish, my friend: we had 4 suites, 9 women who come to Vegas twice per year--better customer service could've meant repeat business. But hell--you got your $70.00. 

Remember, your first or second apartment, where you are just trying to 'make do?"  You take your parent's old tv from the basement, your older sister's old stereo system until you can save enough money to get some new stuff. That's how the Palazzo felt. The room was decent enough, the amenities, seemed as if during a budget meeting, some bigwig told the IT department that he had to 'make do."  So some poor middle manager was spent hours on ebay and at hotel auctions trying to 'make do.'  I, as a frequent visitor to Vegas will tell you that there are far better choices than the Palazzo.  There are many hotels that aren't trying to 'make do' and won't ask you to either.All I have to say is Fried Chicken!  So 'effin good.
The butter & cheese corn.  How could that be bad?!
The beer was too warm, but tasty otherwise.
Atmosphere was decent.  I'd go back...After seeing La Piazza al Forno consistently listed in the Valley's top pizza joints by numerous outlets, I decided to try it out before an event on the West side.

My friend and I arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening expecting a dinner crowd, but to my surprise there was only one other table of guests!  I have to say, you cannot beat the wine prices - $5-9/glass.  We shared a spinach salad, which was so-so.  Next, the Margherita D.O.C. pizza with carmelized onions.  Unfortunately, the onions weren't carmelized, just slightly cooked.  I'm not sure if there was a mix-up in the kitchen or somebody back there doesn't know what carmelized onions are...  I felt like the bottom of the pizza was a bit soggy in contrast with the charred crust edges.  The flavors were there, but the execution could've been improved.  We couldn't resist the zeppolis (pillows of fried dough covered with powdered sugar - see pic) for dessert.  So good!  

Overall, we were content with the food and the fast service.  I think La Piazza al Forno is a solid choice for pizza in the Glendale area, but did not make my Top 5 Valley Pizza Joints.Not bad. While the wifey and I only tried breakfast, the rest of the menu looked interesting (like Salmon pizza). It was fairly decent, I feasted on the Eggs Any Style breakfast and the misses ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich. The smoked salmon was a hit and the Eggs any style was just as you would expect. The eggs any style comes with homestyle potatoes (good stuff!), meat and toast...pretty fulfilling. Prices are high, but you should expect it for the convenience and city location.

Update: 1/24/11

I recently revisited this deli and I'll keep it at three stars.  They took the Salmon Bagel sandwich off the menu, but now offer it in a DIY boxed version which is still good! My kids had the french toast which I sampled and it was awesome! It came with white chocolate additions and a really good whip cream topping! This french toast is a must have!!!!I went here for happy hour today.  The bartender was very attentive. I ordered shrimp and crawfish fondeaux and catfish beignets. I also ordered a large swamp thing to drink. The swamp thing was really good. The catfish beignets were delicious. I didn't love the fondeaux though. First of all it had mushrooms in it and I hate mushrooms. But also the shrimp tasted like dirty dishwater, which is not unusual for shrimp in my opinion, but that ruined the fondeaux for me. Overall my experience was A-Ok.I like no extra charges for ANYTHING pickles, pepper, onions etc."Six Schlitzes please".
Funny looks all around.
"Uh, an appeltini then".

It's kinda like that.

Cheers

Total:  $42Well I heard the food was good here so a couple friends and I decided to give it a shot. 

We had sat down and got situated. We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of. 

Well then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where. 

Upon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out. 

All in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load.It was just okay.  I think this was the first time one of our locals had been here where the service for a large party was less than exceptional.  I think they were just a little unprepared for a group of 16 that evening.  

The Texas-style BBQ briskly was good, but a little dry.  The brisket DID have the perfect smoke ring!  The spicy BBQ sauce was my favorite from the three available, but a little too sweet. The veggies that I chose for my side were overcooked.  

I had the Lucille's Amber Ale, and it was very tasty.  I thought that the drink menu was impressive.I do not usually like to rate chain restaurants as the experience is quite typical. However, I was quite unsatisfied with my experience so I thought I would share. I was frequenting the restaurant for a work meeting and we were hoping to be seated near an outlet. As we approached the hostess stand I asked the hostess as to whether or not they had Wifi and outlets. The hostess simply stated that she did not know and she did not bother to find out. We sat in the bar for happy hour, my drink was okay and the food was okay; not worth more than the happy hour price of course. The server was nice and somewhat attentive (she is the reason for the 3rd star). As we left the hostess as the stand walked away as we were not worth a simple good-bye. 

Hey, hey, hey ..goodbye.It was decent. Nothing more, nothing less. Went with girlfriend and her friend on his recommendation on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Epicenter and it tasted nice enough but wasn't anything special. I would say the best thing about the SanTan Brewing Company was their unique beer glasses. I wonder how many of those get stolen on a regular basis...

Food-wise, the girlfriend and I shared a "Windy City" pizza, while her friend ordered the buffalo wings. I tried one of the wings and it was good, but good is how I would describe average buffalo wings. Short of overcooking or forgetting to apply the sauce, they're kind of hard to screw up.

The pizza, however, was pretty bad. The only thing that saved the dish was requesting a side of their ranch. It wasn't regular ranch... really wish I knew what it was because I would love to have some of that at home, whatever it was. So the delicious ranch helped me finish eating what we had ordered, but otherwise it was a very bland pizza.

I won't throw out the cliched "tasted like cardboard," but I will say that it was the most forgettable pizza I've ever had that didn't come from a frozen food section. If you're going to name a pizza "Windy City," it better be a damn good pizza. This wasn't.

If friends wanted to go, I wouldn't mind going back and trying something else (presumably something recommended in a Yelp review) but I certainly wouldn't suggest returning if it were my choice; I'm usually much closer to Four Peaks and they blow this place out of the water.I ate here because I had the 2 for 1 dinner coupon. The food is pretty good but the selection was very limited. For $25 per person is too much. I ate at Spice Buffet at Planet Hollywood and that was $27 per person and there was a lot of selection. So for $2 more I rather go to Planet Hollywood.My first time here , we were seated right away,  it's very noisy, so good for groups but not for romantic dinners,  it did tend to be less noisy as the night went on, the sushi was delicious and totally worth the price, in fact it was a steal , all u can eat off the menu, with exception of sashimi , I will definetly be back.
It's perfect for a large group, and especially for those with big appetites and those who want to try everything off the menu..
They do offer teriyaki which is tasty for those who do not like sushi...Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didn't want to be riddled with guilt about eating out. 

The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here.

They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets...Of all the places to drink in Vegas we ended up here twice mainly due to proximity.  The service is a little random but if you are staying in the Luxor this is a good place to have a drink at a reasonable price, drinks are under 10 and beers 5.  

The lighting is cool but that doesn't make up for the ugly people.  What would one expect from the Luxor? You get what you pay for. 

On my next trip to Vegas you will find me eating hotdogs and drinking dollar beers at Excalibur.If I was to title this review, it would be "Time to Freshen up".  When people go to Mastro's they expect first class service and food.  In my experience, they just did an okay job at both.  My fiancé proposed to me at home and then had reservations at Mastro's for dinner that night. It was a big evening for us (obviously) and he wanted to make sure we celebrated.  He spent so much time and effort planning the proposal that he didn't even think to look at the menu for vegetarian options.  He assumed that they would have some... well they didn't.  My only option was to order side dishes individually or they would give me a platter of 4 smaller sized sides.  Side dishes are not a meal, with the level of chefs they have working in this restaurant they should be able to put a composed dish on the plate.  While my side dishes were good, I will never go back.  Vegetarians, Vegans and Gluten-Free diners should have at least one option on every menu (A salad and sides does not count, that is what we order in addition to our meal).  Ten years ago, a restaurant could get away with this, but not now. But,  I am not going to totally bash the food, because the butter cake was to die for, but that is definitely not enough to make me want to go back.  

Okay, now for the service.  Let me just say that we waited 5 minutes to be greeted, then another 5 minutes to place our drink order... and then another 5 minutes for our drinks.  Not exactly "wowing" the customer from the start. Our server was nice, but overall the service was slow. It was the day before thanksgiving, so they may have just been understaffed.  At the end of the meal we waited at least 10 minutes after we were finished with desserts and drinks for the server to come around again so we could ask for our check.  

After reading this review, you may wonder why I even gave them a 3? Well it is Mastro's, they do have a great ambiance and my hottie said his steak was amazing.  If they want to stay relevant with all the great dining popping up in Old Town, they need to freshen up their food menu, narrow down their cocktail list to real "specialties" and put more attention into the customer's experience.after 1 visit

ambience B+ loved the decor, however, the lighting was quite dark. it was hard to see anything. 

service B+ i would have given pin kaow an A, however, they over-killed on the table touches. i think we had 5 people check on us in the matter of 5 minutes. 

food B+ i enjoyed the dishes, but it didn't make me say, "wow, this is REALLY good."

chicken satay
the chicken was grilled perfectly. the peanut sauce (most likely an authentic sauce), fell a little flat on my palate.

tom ka koong
lemon grass soup with coconut milk, galanga root, mushroom, and shrimp
great in small doses. i could only eat one small bowl, because it was a rich and slightly sour broth. the sourness wore on me at the end of one bowl. that same sourness is why so many people love this soup. it's just not for my palate.

roasted rice beef
beef, cabbage, roasted rice, thai basil and spices
roasted rice is a new concept for me. basically, it is crushed rice that has been roasted and scattered on the beef. interesting texture and a great experience. but not my favorite dish. 

chicken yellow curry
delicious.

overall: B+
hope to be able to visit this place again. sample some other dishes i've never sampled before.Rose and Crown pub has become a Tuesday and Thursday staple for me. Industry night meant for the cool cats, hip hangers on, and other laborers in the so called "industry" (meaning food service) is a great late night reverse happy hour. You can get a $2 well, $3 draft, 1/2 off appetizers, and free pool. EVERY night a letter is randomly selected and written on a chalkboard if that letter begins your last name you are treated to a 25 cent drink! Now "random" I will also call into question so those pals of yours that have names that start with S's or really common names, y'all are out of luck/ they might draw those letters on slower nights. Luckily for me the "T" has been quite frequent popping up and surprising me with the gift of a wonderful well cocktail or draft for a quarter!

Like any good ol' pub, it slangs typical bar food which I have had one wing and not been impressed enough to continue eating. What really makes this place THE PLACE to be is the excellent vibe. The bartenders are funny, personable, and are super attentive which makes it just a generally relaxed place to shoot the sh*t and enjoy the patio misters. The varied seating outside that includes high bar tables, low tables, and the picnic benches allows you to fluctuate with the crowd you convince to come and drink the night away. Also, if you are feeling like a casual DJ you can pay for the high tech jukebox sound system and play some tunes on the great sound system.

All in all, a solid place especially for those deals if you wanna celebrate "Turnt Up Tuesdays" or "Thirsty Thursdays". Chat with the bartenders and Evan, the cook, they are all great people to get to know.I would return for the beer and bar but not the food. It's hard to find an authentic British pub fare in Phoenix. The fish was tough and there seemed to be a layer of water between it and the crust. It was the first time I heard my dad complain about anything in a restaurant .The manager did try to right things by taking it off the bill. The shepherds pie was average. The asparagus served with it was delicious. Is this a normal side dish in Britain ? While the atmosphere - an old house- was cool, We wished we would have passed this by.Lot of pre-made slices lingering in the display area just waiting to be reheated.  I didn't get the feeling I would be eating a fresh slice unless I arrived right at the opening.

A lot of places have the 2 slices w/drink, but most do not end up being $6.22 with tax.  Normally you can get this combo for $5 tax included.

NY mural on the main wall, and certainly has the NY pizzeria feel to it.  Red & White checkered tablecloths, garlic knots, etc.  Hard to find the first time because the mini shopping area is tucked away off the road.40/40 has potential.  Maybe it was just the night that we were there, but my friends and I didn't really enjoy it.  We got in quickly, but then only stayed for a little bit because of the music...it was SO LOUD.  I don't mind it when the music is cranked up, but this was uncomfortably loud.  Like, feel- the-tip-of-your-nose-vibrate loud (no, I'm not making that up).  Make-you-nauseated loud.  "I want to leave NOW" loud.  So yeah, we left.  

I think it would be an awesome place to watch a big game, though.  They have huge screens everywhere, and a big VIP area with stadium seating (at least, I think that was VIP).  I imagine it would be a lot of fun for the Super Bowl.This review is for their conference center only, not the hotel.

Can I just first say, turn the AC doooooooown! I know it was 100+ out, but that doesn't mean I want to be a frigid 63. Not to mention...wouldn't they save money by not blasting the AC so much?  I digress.

I was here for a local workshop/conference for 4 days and we were given full breakfasts and lunch for those 4 days. I had to make sure to write this review in order to say how much I loved their stuffed chicken. It was served to us and normally meat is so dry or undercooked for things like this. But this stuffed chicken was perfect! Juicy. Tender. Soooooo dang tasty! StAte lunch here with my sister on Friday.  The patio was well shaded and so not too hot but it felt a bit cramped even though not all the tables were full.  Lots of items on the menu sounded good but we ended up with the vegetable pizza (we added chicken).  Even though this was on the menu as a starter, we actually split it for our entrée and also ordered a crab cake appetizer to share.  (Full disclosure, she is a very light eater and I was not too hungry that day either).  The crab cake was nothing to write home about but we both really loved the pizza.  It was extremely tasty.  I also loved my ice tea.  I can't remember what it was called, but it had a very complex flavor to it.  I tasted hibiscus and mint with a hint of chocolate.  My sister had a glass of white wine which was fine but I was surprised by how much their wines by the glass were.

The service was spotty as the other reviewers have mentioned.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu but it was a long wait for the food and check.  He also completely forgot about my ice tea refill until I flagged him down.  I understand that you won't have flawless execution in a small local joint like this but considering that our bill came to $30 for what was basically drinks and apps (and at lunch time, no less!) I would expect more.Food is good. Atmosphere is good. Service is poor. It could be the location, but the wait time is ridiculous.So I have this thing for AYCE sushi. Sure, the quality isn't is as good as a regular sit-down spot, but I'd rather get my money's worth. And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this. 

The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already. 

Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah. I'd go again, but I'd like to try something else too.TGI Fridays was on my radar as soon as the Las Vegas Wranglers kicked Colorados A*% @ the CMYE Hockey party. GO WRANGLERS..WOO HOO! 

Just having stadium nachos and three beers during a 3 hour game was definitely, not the end of my dinner plans for the night. My wife and I rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar. Our server was Ricky. He's a low talker for sure, but very nice, and knew what to say and when to say it. Fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe. Old records, pictures, random rowing oars hanging on the walls, and constant striped patterns everywhere you look (probably even on the toilet seat covers). But they do have one thing that I was super stoked to see. They have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service. Now, when I see a bell, all I want to do is ring it.....hard! I was hoping Ricky, would be killer in the service game, so I could ring that bell. Fingers were crossed.

To start out, my wife really wanted the "Loaded Potato Skins"(refer to pic), which I have never had before, anywhere. So I figured, alright, I'm down. They weren't exactly "Loaded", or very good. Bacon, yes, is always good on everything, BUT.. the thing they go on still has to have flavor! It can't just be some semi-soggy, piece of cardboard. Anyways, no bueno on the skins. 

For our entrees, we both ordered the "Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich"(refer to pic). The sandwich looked good, and came with (over)seasoned fries. The sandwich alone was pretty bad, but when you drizzle the delicious Jack Daniels BBQ sauce all over, it becomes pretty tasty! Not amazing by any means, but good. The fries that came with were just way over seasoned. They were so salty, I found myself shaking each one, trying to knock off all the seasoning, before attempting to eat them. During this ongoing battle with my food, Ricky brought both of us refills, made some small chat, and ended with a smile. I'm not big on complaining about food, and figured it wasn't that big of a deal at the time. 

For dessert we had the Chocolate Caramel, and Pecan Explosion (forgot the name, but thought this sounded awesome)(refer to pic). This dessert was actually very good. It put a nice, big smile on our face's. The chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream, and chopped pecans. Very moist brownie, covered in rich, flowing chocolate sauce. Nomnom.

Before we left, I had to ring that bell. Ricky was a good server, and I went for the bell. Let me tell you..., it felt so good to ring that bell, I would go back just for that feeling again. All-in-all, bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily. Head to Fridays for your bell fix today.$1 margaritas, $1 tacos, $2 tequila shots and $2 draft beers, can't go wrong with prices like that! For those prices you're not getting gourmet food but the tacos aren't bad either. The chips & salsa is $3 and is bottomless, the waitress actually offered to box the leftover chips for us to take with us too. 

I wouldn't make a special trip to go here but if you're near Bally's it's a place to get some decent CHEAP food and drinks!I can't really say too much about this place since I only had drinks, and that was a mojito, which isn't my favorite drink. I did have a strawberry mojito which was actually really good. My friend had a coconut mojito and she loved it. The specialty menu shows mostly mojitos so I think its kind of a niche for them.How the hell am I gonna rate a fabric store? I have noooo idea. But, Rickie, fashion designer extraordinaire, knows fabric stores. Like I know Calphalon from Falseaphlon. Or Safeway Vodka from Grey Goose. Or American from Velveeta. Ok. I didn't say I was classy. Just that I know. Remember that. Anyway, big problem with Fabric Depot and Supplies isn't the nicely appointed restroom complete with HUGE can of Lysol and weird vase of baby's breath. Or the strange location. I'd have to say Fabric Depot and Supplies, if I may, that you're biggest problem IS YOUR MISGUIDED NAME.....It should be Upholstery Fabric Depot and Supplies. Very few bolts (yea, bolts, I know the terminology). Lots of heavy, I wanna cover my 80s Ottoman, fabrics and very few I wanna make an a line skirt with a lace halter top, kinda stuff. Store is very organized and nice, helpful staff. If only they'd had lace. Maybe I'd be wearing that cocktail number I mentioned instead of these old Nike sweats and my Every thing's Bigger in Texas T shirt.I can't give this place an additional half star! booo!! But i would give it a 3.5 stars.

i honestly expected a bit more out of this place.. intimate? not really... There was just a girl in lingerie in a windowed room repeating her routine every like 20 minutes.. she puts on her makeup.. she reads a book.. she changes..lights turn off she goes to sleep.. then it repeats again...The waitresses were in not so revealing outfits, not that I wanted to see it but The website i guess just overhyped the ambience of this place.  It is like a classier HOOTERS! 

Decor: Dim lights all around. Cool changing lights lamps. Creative Idea with the different wooden doors around the bathroom area, even though it does confuse us a bit on where to go. The walls were padded like a fancy cabaret.  Nice chandeliers hanging down.  One thing I didn't like though was the selection of some chairs... with barely no back rest.. how do older people lean if they are tired from eating?  I didn't think that was the best chair selection... and for a cold night.. where do you expect us to put our coats? on our no back rest chair? on our laps? so we ended up putting our coats on the side chairs since that's what everyone else was doing.. lack of space basically.

Food: Very good i must say.. Nothing too SPECIAL or UNIQUE but at least the food was very satisfying.  I had the grilles salmon, which was cooked perfectly, a bit raw in the middle.. Perfect for my taste.. The sauce complemented very well.  I also tried the organic brick roasted chicken.. So tender and the spices were cooked with it to perfection! Not too oily or greasy.  I am always iffy when ordering chicken dishes because the chicken might end up being dry.  But i have to say this was one of the best chicken dishes i have had in awhile!  I had a piece of the filet mignon, pretty good. I liked how they had few selections of steak sauces, where I can take turns trying the sauces with the meat.  

Dessert: we had the red velvet cupcakes for my friend's birthday. They were so moist! I loved them. I liked the cream cheese mix frosting on top of it  Another thing that was pretty cool and basic was the cotton candy they gave us to share.. with the LCD light in the middle of it making the cotton candy glow.. i am a big sucker at little things and get all happy!

Service: Excellent.. I would like to say my waitress was hot! hahaha that is all.. Very attentionate and tells us updates on if food is taking awhile. Very considerate.  The place was definitely packed but not the lounge area.

Club: Pretty dead.. we came back here on our club hopping..someone handed us free shot on the house and front door entry so we went back in.  It is definitely an older crowd.. Everyone was just drinking and sitting.. maybe 4 girls were dancing on the dance floor.. The decor is nice though, similar to the restaurant.. There were go go dancers with wooden canes dancing around.. but it was empty so ehhh?!?  We just left with a stamp in case we wanted to come back in and got our free shots.. It is definitely cheaper than drinks at other clubs though..$10-$12 a shot.. compared to The Bank for a patron shot of $15..... I wouldn't come here again though for a night out of debauchery.Not bad, but I should note that my group opted for a table and bottle service when we realized the door people were holding up the line on purpose. Splitting the cost 8 ways means everyone pays $150 for 3 bottles of alcohol, plus no wait, and we get our own space to dance and drink and just have fun in general.

The security guys in the VIP booth area were very accommodating. One thing that annoyed us was the busboy (are they called busboys in clubs?) kept picking up our used cups even when they were half FULL with alcohol. They probably did that so we would drink more, and hence, purchase more $400 bottles of non-top-shelf-alcohol.

We had to pay mandatory 30% gratuity in addition to overpriced alcohol. But we had fun, since we were allowed to dance on the couch. The music was pretty good, the sound system was pretty good, and the place was crowded, but not too crowded. I'd go again ONLY if I was getting bottle service.I guess I expected a little bit more... but they changed it a bit.  You no longer get into costume or throw beads as they had previously done.  The dancers and performers though were HOT!  Hopefully you'll be placed on a float some some hot performers.  I enjoyed being on the float, but it was a tad too short.  I thought that they go around twice as with a show I had seen, but it was pretty cool while we were on them.

The performers made me want to leap up out of my seat and just perform with them.  Initially I thought the performers were people who paid to be on the float... I was like, damn, do we have to learn a small routine (as my excitement built up)... too bad :P...

Watch the show though cause it's a pretty good free show... and do ride a float as it is an experience.Four reasons I come here: it's downstairs from where I work, they have decent prices, the bartender makes a pretty good margarita and I like the patio.

Not a huge fan of their food and in the summertime when the windows are closed it kinda stinks when you first walk in, but overall it's a good place for drinks on a patio-type day on Mill.A Copy of the Reply from Rich Rush... 
I will give them one more chance, for sure... 
NIce letter, I am happy Kay has declded to take some time off.  I have worked in the restaurant biz myself and I know exactly how she felt that day.  I can respect that.  Thank you for your offer for a free lunch.  When I get the spirit to leave the building I'll come in and order the fish tacos, till then, adios! 

Ayren,
 
First I would like to apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  It can take a while for messages to corporate to make it back to us at the store.  
 
Second, I'm sorry that you had a bad experience! The woman you refer to in your letter is named Kay. She is a sweet old woman and the mother of the owner.  She is heavily invested in the business and has not given herself a day off since we opened nearly 3 years ago.  This experience has finally convinced her to take days off! 
 
We take painstaking strides to make sure that our patrons have a good experience and want to come back.  Even though we are franchise, our store is privately owned by a local family.  We try to win our customers one at a time and we would hate to lose you over this experience. If you would please give us another chance, I would be glad to give you and a friend lunch on us!

Rich RushMy mother takes everyone to this place; she's a big fan of tea. I drink tea but am certainly no connoisseur. Their food was pretty good, and the place is very girly and cutesy. Great place to take grandma or mom. Things were reasonable priced; my only complaint was that it was kind of close quarters. I felt like I was dining in a closet. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Unique experience.First time at this restaurant.  My family and I went there because of the favorable reviews.  My meat lovers pizza was good as were the other pizzas we ordered.

My father ordered the spaghetti with meat balls.  Awful!  I mean, seriously not good spaghetti.  How do you not make passable/decent spaghetti with meat balls?  We told the waiter of our displeasure and he did make good on the meal.  I got the feeling that they had heard that before.  If so, then they should make a better spaghetti sauce.  

The roasted olive appetizer was good but the calamari we ordered was just ok.  For the money I expected much better calamari.

The service was very good and the waiter had a great attitude.

In short, stick with beer and pizza at this place and you'll be ok.  Would I go to this place again?  Yes, but I'll stick with the pizza and olive appetizer and beer.I don't get it

no. really. 

 I. Just. Don't. Get. It.

Alright, so maybe I'm not a hamburger fan - but i am when it's good, prime, juicy, beef (like kobe, for instance).  

And the fries?!  O.  M.  G....  D R Y !

That said: the service is very cool.  Top Notch.  Days gone by.  Anyone I have visit from Canada is in awe when I take them here - and I do it serisouly for the service experience - oh, and when I get "is there a burger place around"  (G R O A N ......here we go again....)


So, aunite & uncle were happy.  I didn't even touch a fry.  sorry.  GR8 service (as usual) today - Kudos... and high 5 to ya'sI love the carne asada and guacamole. The flour tortillas taste homemade. The dinner portion is big enough to share. The servers are friendly and attentive. But, the ice tea comes from the soda fountain and the chips taste like they come from a stale bag. The guacamole side was $5.95 for a small cup size bowl. The carne asada plate is $17.95. I think both are very expensive.Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..

We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.

We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. 

For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...

The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!I had the molasses lollipops, which were pretty delicious (and are actually chicken), and a fabulous punch.  However, the waitstaff was kind of icy (although the bartender was very friendly) and everything was overpriced.  I'd go back if someone asked me to but it's not somewhere I'll choose to frequent.**Update** Ok, so I met a friend here for lunch this weekend. We were the only people in the place- sort of a plus in some ways, not so much in others. I am not sure if there is a different chef on during lunch than dinner, but I hope so. We ordered the crostini with hummus (eh), black olive tapenade (eh) and tomato something (this was actually really good) to start off, and bottled water. The bottle was already open before it was brought to our table. Not that a big deal, but I should have gone with no ice (duh) because the drink smelled and tasted like Phoenix area tap water. Is it copper or iron? Hard to tell around that calcium taste. I dunno, you be the judge. My friend and I wondered if it was a 'fresh' or 'refilled' bottle. Whateva on that, we ended up not being charged for the it. My friend had the sliders; I ordered pecan-crusted salmon on spinach salad with raspberry vinagrette. My friend thought there was too much sauce on the sliders; I kind of agreed but it didn't kill the taste of the fresh beef. The salmon was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, it had just enough crust on it without overwhelming the fish, and cooked perfectly. YUM. The salad... eh. The vinagrette lacked dazzle, and this seemed to be 'compensated' by drizzling a lot over the spinach and salmon. The spinach was very fresh, but would have been better plain than with that stuff. It was disappointing enough that I said something about it to the waitperson. Oh yeah, and apparently there was a special of the day... which we found out after placing our order, when we overheard the next couple who came in ask if there was one. I dunno, maybe our fault for not asking? Well, even after a less than stellar lunch, we decided to go for that flourless chocolate cake I had so coveted. Eh. Again, the oversaucing of chocolate and caramel to cover a kind of hockey-puckish little cake that reminded me of those easy-bake oven cakes. The raspberry puree on the side was the best part. 

So I am sad to say, I have to take one star away for now. I will be foolish enough to give it one more try for dinner.... maybe it was an off day. :P


My husband and I went to this place to celebrate my birthday. Despite a good review by the AZ Republic (lol), we decided to try it. Wow, are we glad we did!! 
     The decor adds to a lovely ambiance - low lighting, a beautiful bar, and simple yet elegant table settings. There's a player piano, and conversation tables with overstuffed chairs. Our server, Jason, could not have been more gracious or attentive, even as the restaurant began to fill up. It was nice to be offered bottled, artisan water ($6), which was crisp, clean, and kept in a wine chiller at our table. As Phoenicians know, the local tap water here... yeah, not so much. I hate even asking for a glass of water, normally. 
     The menu appeared to be typical bistro fare, with artisan touches throughout. Each item includes a wine pairing, for those unsure. For those who take too freakin' long to decide (like us), Si the Wine Guy pops out of nowhere to give a knowledgable hand. The wine list has a nice selection, in price range as well as regions, and we were given excellent recommendations for the flight we each chose ($8-15 apiece; ours were $10). We started with an appetizer trio ($17), selecting the ahi tuna with caviar (a nice blend of delicate taste with the bold tuna); the prosciutto-wrapped melon, very nice, and then the crab-imperial stuffed mushroom, with creme fraiche and tomato-topped bruschetta. This last one was excellent, with a rich buttery crab filling. 
     My husband ordered the petite sirloin ($24), and I had the lamb ($26). His was very fresh, nearly fork-tender and cooked perfectly to order, with an understated but complimentary mushroom and spinach sort of ragout, and fingerling potatoes. My dish was tender with an incredible syrah reduction, just bold enough to match the thin-cut and perfectly cooked chops. It was on a bed of delicious mashed potatoes, with sauteed baby green beans and pepper slices- a little bit of heaven from the first bite to the last. 
     For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake with molten raspberry sauce ($8) sounded so tempting, but that will wait for our next visit. We shared the chilled fruit compote crepe ($8) instead, with creme fraiche on top. It was a perfectly light ending. 
     The portions were dead on- generous without being huge, which would have made the richness feel like overkill. After such a scrumpt-diddly-uptous meal, our bill seemed like a deal. 
     Tastings is a well-needed touch of class for the far West Valley, and an excellent value for what it offers. Minus 1 star until same experience with several visits. Oh yeah, I put myself on their email list and they do a lot of prixe fixe/single mingle/that kinda thing events. And wow, this review is long... but it was just that good. It's been a long time since I've been this happy with a dining experience, so check it out already, dammit.Came here for a bachelor party weekend.  Go karting is clean, sober way to keep busy during the day, especially if you're in Vegas when it's too cold to sit out at the pools all day.  You do need most of your faculties on this one, so don't come in hungover, like some of our guys did.

A group package (~$65 each) gives you two races; a time trial that sets your position, and a straight up race.  They let you borrow a head sock so you don't sweat up the reused helmets.  They let you watch a short safety video, but you're soon jumping into the seat of your own car.  There isn't too much tutorial so you're pretty much learning on the fly, even if it's your first time in a go kart.  They give you a few laps to roll at cruising speed before turning on your karts power.  I won't go into driving tips but be mindful of the workers with the flags.  If you see a blue/yellow flag, move over so that faster karts can pass you, this way you'll avoid getting slammed into on the numerous hairpin turns.

One of our guys was too aggressive in his bumping (not allowed!) and crashed under the plastic barriers, 'causing them to stop the race.  He was warned, but not disqualified.  He ended up with some deep scratches along his arm and hands where the barrier scraped him, so needless to say, it's not something you should be doing.

Lastly, the crew are pretty friendly, and if you check in on Facebook, you can get a free can of Monster energy drink!what can i say about costco ? no matter the town your in your likely to run into the hordes of hellen keller wannabees. Is everyone seriously that dense that they think  its ok to run over everyone else. Never ever go in on a weekend if you can help it. not unless you like battling hordes of mindless automatons seeking out mega packages of burritos. My favorite are the slugs who mooch off the free samples. get the F out of my way you sample whore. Seriously do people just come here to eat lunch at the sample stations? The food court is cheap enough ANDELAY... I am pretty much convinced that you end up spending more at this place unless you have a family of 20 to feed..but the illusion is fun..lolSo bitter-sweet. I never bring my dogs here first but I do rely on on them for a variety of reasons. 

I take comfort in the fact that their vets and vet techs are knowledgeable and obviously love animals.

I also take comfort in their late hours. It is really expensive but if my dog is freaking me out, the $200+ visit are usually worth it to me if i don't think it can wait.


Regular vet visits are insanely expensive so I also have a regular vet I take my dogs to. This is my last resort place.

My girls have also stayed at their pet hotel while I was on vacation, they came back looking really nasty so I probably won't be taking them to the pet hotel again. HOWEVER, they seem to always have a spot in case of emergency and every other pet hotel is booked.I am always rooting for the small indy owned places around town and even the small local chains. Going in I really wanted to like Hougan's.  I ate my sub and although I didn't dislike it, like Mindy A., I just though it was OK. Nothing really stood out flavor wise. 

The ladies behind the counter were very friendly and that's a plus, however, service alone isn't enough to make me go out of my way to visit again. The sandwiches need more flavor. They are slightly pricey and even if they were cheaper, there are too many better sub shops in Vegas to seek this one out.   Johnny Dill, Capriotti's, Any decent Italian deli, and Naked City all dominate by comparative standards. 

You have the service down, now work on the flavors and I'll pay a revisit. I want to give you more stars, give me a reason Hougan's.This bar is a lot of fun, but very weird....the later the night gets, the more older generation you'll see. It's not a bad thing, please don't get me wrong at all!

But, us girls usually get hit on by people...who are at our dad's age. that's the creepy part. 

Drinks are unbelievably cheap! it's crazy.Cookies

If cookie monster had not been arrested in Times Square recently I would say that you could find him here eating all the yummy COOKIES.

I like to stroll over here and devour a few dozen cookies now and again... I guess you could call ME a cookie monster (legal).

Everyone here is so friendly and sometimes even gives me FREE COOKIES when I order 2 they give me 3 etc...

I've eaten other food here a few times, chili was good, but no tabasco was available to make it better.

Never had a sandwich here so can't say. I will say it one more time though:

COOKIES (no one judges you for it)

http://todayentertainment.today.com/_news/2013/04/09/17671380-costumed-cookie-monster-arrested-after-shoving-2-year-oldI've been here a couple of times.  (Out of sheer laziness..)

Their gyros are ok.  They give you a good portion, but I wouldn't really rate their food as anything more than average.

I usually judge places like this by their chicken shawirma, much like I judge a sushi bar by their spicy tuna rolls.  The difference between their chicken shwawirma and the same dish from a better restaurant is like the difference between L&L's chicken katsu vs. Aloha Kitchen's chicken katsu.  Aloha kitchen's chicken katsu is FAR superior.My husband got the shrimp and I got the crabettes:

Fried Shrimp - delicious! Great breading and fried to perfection.

Fried Crabettes - STAY AWAY! I actually really like imitation crab (I know, weird)...so when I ordered it I was expecting it to be imitation crab. But it just didn't taste right. The first bite was maybe okay, but I really didn't like it much after that. I will stick to keeping my imitation crab in crab louie salads and California rolls :P

The fries that came with both of our entrees were decent. Nothing special, just good fries.

I'll have to get the shrimp next time, or try the fried fish. I should have just went with the fish, but I'm a sucker whenever I see crab on a menu.The employees are definitely nicer than the Pete's in South Phoenix but I would rather deal with the mean and tatted up old lady in South Phoenix than getting under breaded and under cooked onion rings. The burrito was excellent and they give you more sauce than usual in this location though.If you're looking for a nice piece of meat you'll certainly get that here but I think it's average at best overall.  I tried 4 different steaks, New York Sirloin from Nebraska, New York Sirloin from Washington, the Ribeye from Illinois and one of the American Waygus. The Waygu was overcooked, ribeye tasty and both sirloins my favorite of the 4 (I actually liked the Washington best because it was kind of sweet which sounds weird for a cut of beef but it was really different and tasty).

With that being said, I thought the sides were EH...cream of spinach my favorite, fingerling potatoes kinda crappy (I think I've had better at Outback), mac n cheese ok, mashed potatoes kinda like Boston Market, you get the idea.

The wine selection was excellent though and so was this cocktail I got called Pins and Needles that's a gin drink served with cucumber and egg white.  It's only about 1/4 of the way full when you get it which is certainly disappointing but I guess standard for a top notch steakhouse (or big name I should say) but definitely delicious and refreshing.

Best part hands down was the service. Very elegant and over the top but a lot of fun. I think I'll try a different steakhouse next time though since I know there are better ones in Vegas and plenty to choose from.We came on Sunday afternoon and ordered the chicken katsu bowl and the spicy chicken teriyaki plate for 16.

- Perfect intensity of spice! Not too hot where you'll be trying to calm the flame in your mouth with a drink.
- Nice crisp of chicken katsu. Not too breaded and oily like L&Ls.
- Kikkoman spicy teriyaki marinade fail. I love the marinade bc I use it myself. It Pretty much tastes the same. 
- A bit expensive. Expected. franchise prices. Should be 4 bucks for a bowl and 6 for the plate. 
- Horrible Mac salad. I thought this place is Japanese? 
- I'd opt for island flavor just a mile away.I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.  

First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly. 

The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.

The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide "2.5 dollar signs".  Granted, I did not come for "Happy Hour" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.

Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.  

So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was "ok".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree.i loveeeeeeeeeeeeee sanrio. specifically badtz-maru!! but there was no badtz-maru to be found at this sanrio store T_____T

the selection at this store was alright-- lots of hello kitty things. they didn't have much variety with any of the other characters, though. 

the girls behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating.

i think i was just really disappointed that i couldn't find anything that had badtz-maru on it.

hopefully they'll bring in more variety next time! hello kittly will do for now ^___^Prepare yourself for an authentic experience. Depending on your comfort level authentic may not always be a great thing. Staff very friendly and decor is pretty cool.We had a discount coupon for this restaurant and visited for the first time. Upon arrival we discovered the majority of the seating is outside on an enclosed covered patio. Even though they had heat lamps it was chilly. We decided to wait for an indoor table. The wait lasted almost 30 minutes and there's very little area to stand in while waiting.

This restaurant has a VERY lively bar that you can also dine at. It was full and loud. The layout of the restaurant is laid back but accommodates few tables in the main dining area. The entire end of the restaurant restaurant is taken up by the trio that plays on the weekends. Fearing the noise we were happy to find that the trio played familiar but low keyed music that didn't interfere with the dining experience.

Now the food. It was very good with emphasis on Italian naturally. We ordered different items and all were quite good with enough left over to take home. Our waiter was outstanding, friendly, competent and kidding. Every time he brought out a dish he would say, "Take a Picture". It was funny.

Anyway I don't think we will go back. While we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere just was found wanting. When you make a reservation that should ask if you want indoor or outdoor seating.Sephora is the what Orwell's 1984 would have been like if it took place in a makeup outlet instead of a dystopian Britain. 

A large, spacious warehouse occupied by at least a half dozen identically dressed employees, separated only by their choice of eye shadow, all programmed to say the same four or five phrases. Some of the smarter ones know how to shuffle the order of the phrases. Some don't.

Employee 1: "Can I help you with anything?"

No. I'm good.

Employee 2: "Can I help you with anything?"

No, didn't you just hear me? I'm good.

Employee 3: "Would you like a basket for all that?"

Actually, I would, thanks.

Employee 3: "Can I help you with anything?"

...

Seriously, though. Why do you need six people at a time in a makeup shop? It's makeup, it's not Sam's Club. You're never going to need an extra pair of hands to lift a crate of palletes.

Why are you staring at me? Oh. Shit. Am I wearing makeup?

Haha. I didn't even notice that. Man, am I glad you caught that.

How ridiculous would I have looked wearing makeup... in a makeup store?

You wouldn't know this from my pointless ramblings, but I'm actually quite the Sephora whore. With the exception of one excursion to a MAC Cosmetics in Redwood City, CA, all of my makeup has been purchased from them, and usually at this location.

Egad. Does that mean...

Yes, I'm an attention whore and just like to complain about shit. Probably because my parents didn't love me. Oh well. This Urban Decay eye shadow makes up for it. Kinda.

I must be stopped.I wasn't crazy about this location. I have eaten at the one in Henderson that was really good but this location just lacked in many areas. 
First let me talk about the service. It is the ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars and not 2 stars. The hostess was super friendly and checked on us at our table many times.  The server had a nice charm about him and was excellent at providing service to us. 
Now to the food. I ordered Strawberry Chicken and it just tasted like they simmered some strawberry jam and then poured in over the chicken. It was dripping with the sauce and that made the chicken very soggy. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was dry and lacked flavor. The soup was unlike any I have ever had it was almost gel-like and very strange.
I had high hopes from previous experience at the other location and the decor on the inside made the place look very upscale but the food is what it comes down too and it just wasn't up to par.Me, Terri R, and Alicia R recently hit this place up for dessert.  The original plan was Claim Jumper but since we were all tired out from dinner, something light like boba was good enough to hit the spot, catch up on the week, and hang out.  Nothing beats dessert and great convo with some of my favorite people (i.e. the Wonder Twins). 

I had their Cappuccino Blast with double boba.  The boba was consistent and the drink itself was pretty good.  For a Lollicup, I was actually surprised that there was a little coffee kick to it.  Usually their drinks are just okay and powdery.  But not on this visit. 

This Lollicup has your regular after lunch and dinner treats like smoothies, milk teas, and boba.  I prefer my boba from places like No 1 Boba, Icy Juicy, and the Perfect Scoop.  But when you're in the mood for a cold refreshment with boba and you're in Town Square, then Lollicup is one of those places that needs to be visited.  The drinks here are average, but will still hit the spot. What makes this Lollicup different from the rest of the Lollicups out there is the that this one is a basically a little stand meaning there's really no place to chill.  You simply put your order in and wait for them to serve it.  The drinks here aren't bad at all, just not the best I've had.  I'm not giving Lollicup 3 Stars because it was bad.  It's just average to what you'll find around town. 

Cappuccino Blast w/Boba:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lollicup-coffee-and-tea-las-vegas?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#Wj5nK6zMi1zi92pQ8hks3QI'll start out by saying that Blue Wasabi used to be my favorite restaurant. When they first opened they had amazing sushi that was far better than Ra. I felt that way for years, but recently things have been changing. The last few times I have eaten here, the sushi just hasn't been the same. The rolls have been loose and fall apart as soon as they are picked up. It makes for a messy meal. It also doesn't taste the same, the food just isn't as flavorful. I don't know what is going on, but they need to check themselves. I still appreciate their happy hour and their quick service, but I find myself looking around for better sushi now. If it weren't for years of happiness prior to the last year than I would have given them 2 stars instead of 3.So because we were staying at Monte Carlo, for our Anniversary dinner, we decided to try out this restaurant. I searched on Yelp for a nice restaurant, and this one happened to come up as closest (obviously, since it was inside Monte Carlo) with 3 money signs. Plus it said it was romantic. 

So we made reservations and headed on down there. First of all, the hostess was not friendly. She asked for my last name and when I told her, she replied "what??" instead of "excuse me" or something similar.. And then when she located my reservation, she said "ah" with no further instructions. And as I looked around, she finally said that another hostess was coming up to escort us to our table. (awkward of her to make us momentarily confused).

Then we get to the table.. The restaurant is literally right next to the tables at the casino so it's pretty loud.. (specially when some Las Vegas Virgin is overhyped and keeps yelling VEEEGAAAAAASSSS every time he wins a hand.. Uff) So it's not quite romantic.. 

Then the service was ok.. I felt rushed by the server. He seemed rushed as well too. We ordered the calamari, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the Chilean sea bass.

Calamari - was amazing. Probably the best calamari I've had in a long while. They were fried to perfection

Filet mignon - was amazing as well and I don't even like steak! HOWEVER, the steak came with NOTHING. It as just 2 bits of steak on a plate plus 2 different sauces and that was it. Um!? Usually, at a steakhouse, steak is served with at least a side of veggies or fries.. or SOMETHING. NO. Here, it came with nada! WHY!? Idk. But fine, if the steak comes with no sides, I would expect the server to inform us "the steak does not come with any sides. Would you like to order any sides such as fries, baked potatoes, or etc?" But no. He didn't say anything. 

Chilean Sea Bass - was amazing. It came with lemon risotto. Cooked to perfection. I finished the entire plate way too quick!! Excellent. 

We didn't order any dessert here so I can't comment on that. 

All in all for the above items plus a beer and a glass of wine, the total came up $130 + tip. For that price, I wish the server was more attentive to us and MAYBE told us about the sides situation for the steaks. "/ Also, as mentioned above it was pretty loud.. Not a good place if you want a quiet dinner with conversations. Also, the wait time between taking the order.. and getting our appetizer.. and then finally getting our entrees was quite long... But I must repeat again that the calamari and chilean sea bass were AMAZING. Just was a bit disappointed with the service (including the hostess who should be the face of the restaurant who provides us with the first impression of the place... And she ruined the first impression ;[ )Not quite what I would call 5 stars. The music and production is fine, the performances are spot on, but its not quite for everyone. If you didn't grow up listening to the music, I don't know how it could be a five star event for you. that said, it's still very entertaining, extremely well executed and fun. It's not a knock out punch like Love or KA, but it's very much worth the price. If you're not a fan of the music, check out Love, Blue Man or KA before giving this a try, those shows have a wider appeal, better sound and sight lines. After that-- definitely worth giving this a try. Interesting and lively east coast crowd was there when I saw this. Dedicated cast!Love the atmosphere, love the temperatures, love the lazy river, love the access to the casino when desired, LOVE the option to get comfy reserved seating with waitress service! Fun in the sun. 
Just really don't love the dis-jointed way the reservations themselves are handled. We were told by the cabana rental people to just go grab a cupla loungers behind the red ropes and someone would be over with a credit card swiper. By the time the swiper-toting person arrived, they were accompanied by a couple who wanted our seats! Not fun in the sun. 
We all eventually worked it out, but it took some of the fizz outta my soda that day :[Free is nice... And maybe, if you are luckier than I, something will actually be going on in the factory.  But it is always nice to get the free sample, especially since the product is prohibitively expensive.  The cactus garden is pretty.to see during the day or holiday decorated. During holiday evenings (at least tonight) is BUSY!  So be prepared to deal with inconsiderate crowds!First, I have to say that I tried to explain the name to my English husband and he just did not understand the humor.  At any rate, he was willing to try this place.

We have been twice and, although my husband likes the burgers, I am just not convinced yet.  It is possible that I have not tried the right combination yet.

On our first visit, I had the chicken wrap with avocado.  Except it was not avocado - it was more of a guacamole spread.  It lacked the fresh avocado taste that I was expecting.  The fries on this occasion were a bit hit and miss with the seasoning but good overall and the onion rings were nice - with soft rather than crisp breading.

Today I tried the Bleu Chicken which includes swiss and bleu cheese.  The first problem is that the chicken is about half the size of the bread.  I can deal with this because the grilled sourdough bread is nice with cheese.  The other problem I had is that the swiss cheese had a really strong taste.  Of course, this is my personal preference but it was a little off-putting.  The fries this time were seasoned perfectly and uniformly.  Also, we ordered the half "best of both" as we did with our first visit but there seemed to be so much more in the basket today (certainly not a bad thing!!!).

So, I have not written off Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The chicken is moist and the fries taste good.  I think that I just need to find the combination that works for me.  I will definitely try it again - especially since I joined their mailing list and receive coupons regularly.  I think if you are a beef eater, you will enjoy it greatly.I went here for the first time with a few coworkers for lunch last week. The prices on lunch were actually really decent. The portions were equally as satisfying. What it lacked was flavor. One person in our group ordered one of the $17 (which the price isn't listed) lobster specialty rolls. We all tried it and agreed, it could have been fake crab and tasted better. I am by no means a sushi snob, but this placed really disappointed me. I would rather pay more at one of the many other sushi places that flank this area on Sahara.My wife insisted that we take this tour. Alright, I have nothing better to do on a Saturday. It took about 4 hours of my time between taking the tour and driving back and forth. This place is out in the boonies so call ahead for directions, I don't think GPS will be your best bet.

Shamrock Farm is run by one of the largest companies in Arizona, Shamrock Foods. I believe they said there were about 2,000 cows/Heifers (a Heifer is a cow that has never given birth) and a handful of Bulls on this farm. The cows are milked daily and it's so interesting that they all line up into these contraptions that lock into place so they can be milked. This place is very clean, they must clean this place constantly. They have a gift shop and a place where you can grab a hot dog or some ice cream. They take you out on the tour in a tram, you can pet or feed some newborns. There were 15 newborns the day we were there; those bulls are definitely living the good life.

I heard this place is popular for field trips on Tuesday's & Thursdays so plan your trip accordingly.Had a burger here for lunch.  It was ok.  I had to pay extra for bacon and cheese to be added, which brought the price to about what I would pay at Delux, but the quality was nowhere near Delux.  The service was excellent, the iced tea was fresh, but it was a very expensive lunch at $20 plus tip, for a burger that just did not impress.There's a reason people flock to this place, it's cheap. But that's really the main appeal other than the pre-made sushi revolving in front of you. I learned quickly that the staff do not deserve much of a tip because they're not very attentive or trained to refill cups or ask you for your check, etc. I think there's a reason the staff never comes around to ask how everything is going because they'd be getting terrible feedback. Food is okay but even then I've had some bad experiences with getting a roll off the belt and it tasting warm. I dont think sushi should stay in room temperature for as long as they let it. 

My word of advice is to not get anything that everyone else is ignoring. Its probably been sitting out for an hour or two. Especially "Today's special Conchi" - I don't think anyone's ever actually had it.I attended Simon's restaurant when it was at the Hardrock......alas it has moved.  

Begun by my buddy's $25 shot of Patron Platinum (following a $30 OpusX cigar earlier at Shadowbar) everything at Simon was good but overpriced for the quality.  The one shining aspect of the meal was the AMAZING breadbowl, however, featuring homemade cheeze-its, buttermilk biscuits, handmade pretzels, and zucchini bread.

For my meal I had the Cali Pizza (Toro, Crab, Avocado, Daikon, Endive, Soy) and 4-cheese saffron truffle mac n' cheese.  Simon states this is the best Mac n' Cheese in the world but I've had better at Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak, Emeril's Fishhouse, and M at Miranova.

For dessert?  The junkfood platter with gourmet versions of a hostess cupcake, snowball, ricecrispy treats, and a chocolate shake.  Cute, but essentially just sugary.

My friend loved his steak and chocolate cake.

The highlight of the meal, however, was the hostess in the leather apron.....yowzaz.Went here last night for dinner around 8pm. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated promptly. There was a pizza and wine special (every Weds apparently), but we opted to go order from the menu as i had pizza for lunch.  I love trying chicken salad sandwiches at new places, so why should this place be any different? Maizie's had grapes and dried apricots mixed in... Wonderful! Perfectly peppery to balance out the fruit.  For the side, the server recommended a mix of hand-cut and sweet potato fries, which did not disappoint.  I love SP fries that are medium cut like theirs and the fresh-cut potatoes were amazing! The chipotle aioli was quite good too.  I wasn't in the mood for a drink (what?!), but i did try the bf's red sangria, which was pretty good and i would definitely order it next time i want a cocktail.  He ordered the special which was ribs with sides of new potatoes, roasted veggies and some sort of corn. He couldn't finish it all and that is quite odd for him. At $13 it was quite the steal for him to have leftovers!
I hope we can get back there for happy hour, which runs from 3-6pm... I can't remember if its weekdays or every day... But i look forward to a few $3 sangrias!   =)I had heard this place talked up quite a bit, so I came in with high expectations.  They were not met.  It's not bad, but it is definitely over-hyped.

The space is very small, so the menu is necessarily limited--the first time I came in, I actually left without ordering because none of the day's offerings really appealed (plus it was SUPER crowded).  Since I came in this time with a group of 3, I found the paucity of tables a bit inconvenient--I feel like the bar seating should be reduced to make room for smaller tables (and then there's the 6-8 person table in the middle which seems like overkill).  I admit, we did come in at 10am on a Saturday, which is one of the busier times.

I had one crepe each off the sweet and savory menus.  The savory crepe contained eggs, summer squash, and cheddar, but it was so heavily salted that it might as well have been a crepe stuffed with salt.  I seriously could barely taste anything else.

The sweet crepe (raspberry & lemon curd) was much better, although I felt like there were a few too many berries in relation to the rest of its contents.  I tasted my friend's banana/almond/nutella crepe and it was completely delicious.  My skim latte was also very good and complimented the sweet crepes beautifully.

My overall assessment is that this a decent place to get take-out dessert, but avoid the savory crepes and only plan to eat in during off hours.There are some undeniably regrettable parallels between the protests for democracy in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arabic world, and what's going on in Wisconsin, but there are also some very important differences.  In the Middle East and North Africa, the protests are the result of an expansion of the literate middle class concomitant with growing social expectations, they're fighting for democracy.  In Wisconsin, we're an embattled middle class, fighting to preserve democracy in the workplace.  In Cairo, protesting is frightfully dangerous, and protective headgear for protesters is a must.  In Madison, the three main police agencies are very nice, polite, not at all dangerous, and silly headgear for protesters seems to be de rigueur. In Cairo, a lot of coffee shops and tea houses are shut down, and protesters would be limited to Turkish style coffee or Arabic style tea.  In Madison, there's an excellent, personable, unique bourgeois coffee shop serving organic fair trade coffee one block out from the state capital building (which is absolutely beautiful, protest or not) in literally every direction.  
      Okay, so if you're in need of a cappuccino, served properly in a dainty cup with saucer, finished with a leaf shaped mark of steamed milk, and you walked  due north of the capital building from your protest, then here's your place.  Its main advantage over the ludicrous plethora of other quaint little coffee shops playing independent indie-rock in this college town, is its location. For those who want to walk from the capital, it's very convenient.  Other pluses are, it is a sunny little location, with friendly competent staff, tasty crepes (using Wisconsin produce and cheese), I recommend the spinach, cheese and mushroom.  The somewhat cramped interior is ringed with seats facing out to the two streets for solitary drinkers and their notebook computers, but the center has an L shaped low table with unfixed stools, making it perfect for group project work.  When you're protesting to preserve worker rights with a bunch of teachers, you want to proofread your placards for spelling and punctuation, these tables are perfect for neatly fixing those inappropriate apostrophes on protest signs with colorful Sharpies.  
     It is a small location, but when I was in there, the turn-over was quick, and the coffee is excellent.  Although the location would seem to be convenient for the children's museum right next door, like most coffee shops, it's not really an appropriate place for young children, the space is tight, there's hot coffee everywhere, the tables are low, and "the grown-ups are talking here."  If you're looking for a longer, solitary, coffee drinking and reading hide-out, there are better places for that near by, with more comfortable seating.  The prices are pretty comparable to the other campus and downtown area coffee shops.
     Okay, properly re-caffeinated, its time to return to the fight for democracy in the Wisconsin workplace.  And Cairo, I hope you get both democracy, and cappuccino, soon.Not sure what everyone else was eating, but for me it was just okay. The meat had a great flavor/taste but a slight tough and fatty at times. The salsa bar seemed to be flavorless and cut down with water or something. Every great taco must be accompanied by a great salsa/chili.
 If your in the area I would give it a shot.Just got a very nice email from the GM apologizing for our bad experience and explaining the whole "global cuisine" deal, and also to ask for a second chance. OK, I'm impressed. I might just do that. Stay tuned.....Had an early morning flight to Philadelphia this morning.  Didn't get a chance to grab a bite to eat before I left the house, so I stopped by Flatbreadz.

I decided to get 2 toaste Sesame Seed Bagels w/cream cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bagels were pretty fresh.  They toasted it just right too....not too burnt, but not undercooked either.  I would have rated them 4 Stars, but the cream cheese was a fluffy cream cheese and didn't have much taste....must have been fat-free or something like that....which is a bummer because I like full-flavored cream cheese.

The employees were friendly and the place was clean.

Will I return?  If I'm in the A Gate area, sure.The atmosphere here was great, but the hostess was pretty irritated with us that we didn't have a reservation (funny because the place was empty). She seated us in the very back corner on what would be the patio in better weather. They had a tarp surrounding it with heat lamps above and cold air coming in from the sides right on our table - I think that was our punishment for the lack of reservations. 

As for the food, the appetizer of calamari had few squid. You had to dig for them amongst a tower of fried carrots. But everyone liked the carrots. The steak I ordered was HORRIBLE. It tasted like roast beef, maybe being baked in the oven first and the salmon was overcooked. The salad was amazing, though and so was the lasagna, but don't expect your normal Italian lasagna - not happening here. It's different, but good. The winner of the night was, surprisingly, the giant burger which my boyfriend claimed was the best he had ever eaten. The dessert of chocolate cake, almost like a torte, melted in your mouth - I'd come back for that! 

I would go again if someone else was paying or if I were just going for drinks and dessert. I don't know if I'd take the chance ordering entrees again.I attended the opening ceremony and opening night of Encore.
The crowd waiting to enter encore at 8 PM for the grand unveiling was in a festive mood.
The crowd was festive even though the line to get in snaked through the entire Wynn.
The mood began to dimish as 8:15, 8:30, 8:45, 9PM started to roll around and the line had moved a grand total of 45 feet.
The employees of the Wynn spent the entire day promoting the 8PM start and invitation to experience the new hotel an casino.
Then they treated it like entrance to Tryst. 
Opening the line a few "guests" at a time so as to not impeded on the "total experience" of the Encore for all the others.

Please - - - it is another huge addition to the Vegas strip and there was nothing magical to it..........
The hotel is pleasing, the casino is very similar (obviously) to the Wynn-although there is a touch more red in the decor and the experience should be wonderful once the staff is on the par with the Wynn.

I do not think, as a whole,  there is an entire staff that can match the quality of the people that work in the Wynn.
Encore will get there .........  the place looks great.
Soon the quality of the staff will catch up as well.

By the way ...... The casino was very enjoyable about 2 AM on opening night ( or morning).Until 5:30 this morning I would have rated this five stars, but having to deal with drunk smokers while trying to find a cup of coffee really put me off. The cafe doesn't open until 6am and we had an early flight to catch. I was directed to the East Bar which was packed with drunk 20-something smokers. Really off-putting--some of Encore's guests *are* grown-ups. The hotel itself is gorgeous (aside from the smoke) and our room was really nice (aside from a torn duvet cover and a lack of outlets in useful places.)

We had several meals here and one big plus is that my allergies were easily handled--with absolutely no hesitation or trouble. Dinner at Red 8 was fantastic. Breakfast at Society Cafe was meh (the omelet was dry--overcooked and maybe had been sitting?) but the way my allergies were handled was impressive. 

I was fully prepared to only stay at Encore any time I'm in Vegas but after this morning, I'm not entirely certain I'll be back. While I don't need to find the Senior Center just yet, I would rather stay in a hotel that caters to adults, not the club crowd.Great environment, great bartenders... just an OK placeto dine. I'd go to 4 stars if I were reviewing "a good time", but as such, 3 stars have it. I would have to say the best food is their fish tacos, but I haven't tried everything on the menu... so give it a shot.What not to love unlimited fries and great burgers. I love the milk shake. I would rather pay $3 more dollars and go to roaring fork.  The prices here are way overpriced for burgers in a plastic basket. But mighty tasty. I really want to give four but my index finger wont let me.3 Stars = I have no idea what Pho should taste or look like. I'm a newbie, I've heard good things about Pho, so I've been dying to try it. 

Tried Nam Sao this past Sunday. They don't have an online menu, but they are right down the street, so since it was freezing cold outside, we decided what a good night to try some pho. It's a bright little shop, where you can sit down or order takeout. There were about 10 tables, which is probably plenty. Seemed there was only one guy working, but I couldn't really see in the kitchen. We got a Beef Pho, and Beef and Shrimp Pho, threw in a veggie egg roll and spring roll just to try, it comes with two and it was our first shot at trying the place so figured it was worth trying. Figured out later that the BF wasn't sure he'd like pho so just in case he'd have something else to eat. 

Had a little trouble figuring out what to put our Pho in when we got home. We didn't think it was meant to be split up, so we just busted out some oversize serving bowls and dumped it in. The to go order came with some bean sprouts, a little pack of what looked like hoisin and some siracha or some type of chili sauce mixed together, a couple of green leafy things, and some slices of jalapeno. We decided all of it was meant to go into the soup, so we added it all with the exception of some bean sprouts. I really enjoyed it. I love noodles, and I thought the flavors were real good. I will definitely return for more. I can't imagine getting anything other than beef though, it was perfect for this meal. Can't wait to try other places and see how it compares. Super Cheap and very filling!DO NOT come here for any sort of massage/facial. Then again, it might just be the woman who serviced me, her name was COCO (SO REMEMBER THAT NAME). The massages were really rushed and fast. NOTHING about it was relaxing. It was like "Get in, get out", I think the massage should have been one hour but they tried to squeeze a massage, body scrub, scalp massage and wash, facial all in 70 minutes. I should've known better. The shampoo and conditioner they used for the scalp massage wasn't as good as the ones in the public wash area. My hair was all tangly afterwards, but my skin was soft enough after the scrub. Wat do u expect tho, the scrub was one of the most painful i've ever had -.- I was a little suspicious about the cleanliness of my masseuse because when I came in, I asked for another towel and she just threw my old towel into the pile of new towels. Then one of my towels had make up stains on it and a piece of here.. I don't wear make up to the spa so it might've been someone else's towel that she mixed in with all the clean towels. Kind of disturbing.. 

 I did the $130 Body Scrub package "Scentau" or sth.. I've had more relaxing scrubs at Wi Spa. However, this spa is definitely much cleaner. The sauna rooms were very organized and clean. The customer service was really good. There is a lot of facilities within this spa, like 8 types of saunas or sth. There're definitely not as many people as other korean spas I've been to. The food is not that great but the price is alright. I ordered a Strawberry smoothie for around $5 and it tasted like they mixed some sort of soup into the drink. Maybe it's a healthy blend of things, who knows. The kimbap was kind of bland, they put sliced up fishballs in there or sth.. it tasted kind of spoiled.. Overall, the spa was great but just no massages for me, as for the food. I'm sure you can't go wrong with the kalbi, which was $10 but i wasn't that hungry. And just don't get the smoothie, the facilities are great though.It's your standard, run-of-the-mill hotel with all the normal amenities included. Free internet, good deal. Cookies are tasty.
Location is the one advantage it has, that and free parking, even if city parking in Madison is a breeze (less than $10 for 24 hours, yes please!).
It's just so strange to have such a hotel smack in the middle of campus, but that's definitely a good thing.Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.

Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.

The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game.Great value for lunch!  Quick service......tasty meal.......good prices!Pretty good, especially considering that it's a fast food joint at a hockey rink.My husband being a native New Yorker is always searching for a decent pie. He enjoyed Glass Nickels pizza and plans on coming back. 

I thought it was okay but I am an Ian's Pizza junkie.We went to celebrate a classmate's birthday and had a really good time.  I adored the tableware: it was heavy and had a "medieval" feel.   The lunch special is a really good deal.  I'm not a fan of paneer and that was the day's veggie lunch special, so  I got the veggie wrap instead.  It was excellent!  So were the fries (more fries please!).  The waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch special includes dessert, they asked my friends if they still wanted it.  Huh? I didn't have a lunch special, so I used my handy dandy Yelp check in offer for a free dessert, so I could get some rice pudding.  I've been eating rice pudding all my life and have had many different versions.  Liquidy rice pudding? No thanks.  Thank God we had a terrific birthday cake.My husband, a Glaswegian, and I decided to check this place out. It is a bit of a drive from our house in North Scottsdale,  but there is such a dearth of places to get a good pint and authentic British food that we made the drive. The restaurant is large and nicely done. It was a quiet Sunday when we went and we both thought that the size of the place and the lack of a crowd made it seem a little cavernous and lacking in energy. Seems better suited for a live music event or busy weekend crowd. The food was good although my husband's steak pie came to the table cold -- we noted that another Yelper commented on the same issue. Once would expect the management to correct something so simple. Another note: How can a pub be a pub without Curry and Chips on the menu!? The service was adequate, if somewhat authentically British.  The staff were pleasant but seemed to be hiding at times. We had to track our waitress down to pay the check. We are looking forward to giving this place another try on a more lively night.Guys in Ed Hardy shirts - check (although less than one would expect at a nightclub named after the Ed Hardy designer)
Weird sunken bar that makes it a tad awkward to order drinks - check
No line and no cover on a Saturday night - check (TI guests - even guys - get in for free)
Good music all night long - check
Plenty of space to dance due to a moderate sized crowd - check
Patio with a nice view of the Strip - check

I wanted to hate this nightclub. I went in expecting it to be douched out to the hundredth degree and it wasn't. Even the clientele was less douche-tastic than I thought. In fact, there is very little about this club that makes it memorable or worth the time to go out of your way to check it out. Go if you are staying at TI. If you aren't, there are better clubs on the Strip.Total east coast dive deli... and there's nothing wrong with that. CCC is a place that has what you're looking for when you need a quick lunchtime meal. Coffee, fresh cookies, daily soup specials, salads, wraps, hot 'wiches. It's all there. While the menu on the wall lists about 20 items, don't be afraid to make a custom sammie. They have a decent selection of breads, meats, cheeses and toppings for you to make a beautiful lil' hoagie for yourself. While nothing will blow you away here, it's nice to know that there's still a sandwich shop in town with a friendly owner running the place and some homemade food on the specials board.Still a fan of Jet, since I like the 3-in-one feel this club has.  But I thought I'd update you guys since I was recently here again for NYE 09.

Overall, the New Years experience was OKAY.....  not the greatest time of my life but I didn't hype it up to be so I'm okay with that.  As usual, I was in LV solo, but that's not gonna keep me inside when the bell strikes midnight.  So I planned ahead to go to Jet, because their management company sent me an email advertising tickets to their new years parties.  Honestly, I kind of sat on the email, didn't respond right away and buy my ticket to Jet New Years because I was undecided between going there and to Tao.  A couple of days before I flew to Vegas, I did respond to the email with my credit card info, blah blah, but I never received a confirmation.  Now, this was mildly irritating and worrisome, because I didn't want to find out later that I bought a ticket at the door in addition to them charging my card.  But it all worked out, I guess, since they never acknowledged the email or charged my card anyway....

So I put on my sequin-ded dress and my good shoes, elbowed my way through the crowd assembling on the street, and made it over to the Mirage.  Now, here's one important IMPORTANT thing to know about Vegas on New Years - as the night goes on and it gets more crowded on the streets, a lot of the hotels periodically close their doors to people entering from the street unless they're hotel guests.  So if you're able to get your hands on a discarded hotel key, do so, or you'll be standing out in the cold like I was (WEAR A COAT).  I waited maybe 15 minutes or so before they finally started letting people into the Mirage, so I suppose it wasn't too bad.  (As a side note, if I had had my Jet ticket ahead of time, I'd have been let in right away)

I walked over to Jet, was able to buy my entrance ticket for $150 at a counter to the side of the line, and I was let in about 10 or so minutes later.  Coat check was an additional $5.  At this point it was after 11pm, and if they were still having the hosted bar they advertised I missed it or walked past - because I definitely paid for my drinks.  So I posted up in the video screen room for a while, migrated to the middle room, and then back to the big room for the midnight countdown.  Which was pretty unremarkable, actually.  There wasn't an abundance of streamers or confetti, and the DJ didn't do a countdown, which was kind of disappointing.  A couple of drunken guys tried to grind on me on the way past, but there was actually a MUCH smaller crowd in here NYE night compared to other nights that I've been to Jet.  This might be because of the admission cost but who knows....

So overall, it was interesting and basically fun, although not the greatest New Years experience I've had.  I had more fun in Tijuana at a $20 entry/ all you can drink NYE party years ago, and I can't help but think if I had traveled with other people and we just stayed outside for the fireworks and stunt jumps we'd have had loads more fun than the clubgoers, with their uncomfortable clothes and shoes and overly ambitious expectations.  I left the club at about 1am, changed clothes, and hit the tables.My friends and I went on a Monday and this place was PACKED! It could have been because a lot of clubs are dark on Mon, but damn that line was long. We were lucky and called early in the day and got on VIP so we got to walk in for free. There are three room (one main dance floor and two smaller ones) and a bunch of different bars. It was really hard to move around and I'm pretty sure by 130-2 it was passed capacity because i couldn't turn my head without bumping someone. My friend got on the stripper pole and that was some fun. Good music, bitchy waitresses and bartenders and ok decor. Not horrible tho.We were staying at the Mirage, so we decided to check out JET.  It was a Thursday night, and there were only a few people trying to get in...no lines.  Since we were guests in the hotel, we got in for free.

SKYY Vodka was doing some promotion that night, so I was able to get a free drink.  There were a good amount of people on the dance floor, but it wasn't that packed.  We walked around to check out the place, and it seemed like an older crowd that night.  I guess Thursday nights aren't poppin' at JET.  

I had a few drinks, danced a little, and then headed back out to meet our friends that were gambling.  This was one of the smaller clubs that I've been to in Vegas, but not bad.  I'm assuming it has more potential on the weekends.We have been fans of Del Dente for years, but our last visit felt like they have slipped a bit in terms of the wait staff.  The pastas we ordered were very good.  Our waitress seemed like she just wanted to get done her shift - didn't seem friendly or attentive.I like this place! It's simple and it delivers what you expect. The burger's are decent and their milkshakes are great! If you enjoy the simple pleasures of a nice burger and milkshake you'll love The Grill!THE place to hangout and get away from your study life in Waterloo. It's got quite a number of brand stores in all diversities. It's also got a movie theatre where you can relax and a food court to fight your hunger if you ever get starving while hanging out there.Went to a company retirement party here, just appetizers and drinks and it was awesome! Too bad the wait staff herded some non-company related customers through the room while the guest of honor was giving his speech.you want a hotel, what really matters?

Cleanliness!!!  5 stars.
Friendly staff.
And they got the really good cylindrical candies... mmmmm.  

ok, now that we got that out of the way.... some funky odors in one of the hallways and elevator at one end of the hall was out of order our entire stay.

i would come back though.  solid price performer.On the way back to the Phoenix airport, George's Gyro's came up on my Yelp.  Willing to give this place a chance! We did have a plane to catch, so we were a bit rushed; service is a tad slow.  Full menu of gyro's falafels, hummus plates, salads, burgers, Chicago hot dogs, pasta dishes (seems unusual for a Greek place) and more.  I had the falafel pita and the Greek salad; pita was fresh, falafels were home made and delicious.  the Greek salad was tasty, greens, dressing, olives, feta, etc.  soooo good. Husband had the chicken sandwich, it had a nice charbroiled flavor and a good marinade, very good.  Sis had the hummus, very tasty, too bad we had no room for dessert!  Place is clean and friendly, service was a bit slip b manageable.It's about time I tried this Mediterranean joint I've passed many times before.  Tonight, I finally decided to try Manna.  It's located in a strip mall with other eateries like Subway, Roberto's, etc.  Here's what I thought about this place:

AMBIANCE:  Well, what can I say...there was nothing that distinguished the inside of Manna from a Roberto's a couple of doors down.  Small tables around the restaurant.  At the back of the restaurant, there's a glass case big enough for lots of trays of desserts.  Unfortunately there was 4 trays top, which took up less than half the case.  I'm going to blame it on the fact that it was early in the evening.

FOOD:  I got the chicken kabobs (grilled chicken breast, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95, shish kabobs (ground seasoned beef grilled, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95 and the fried zucchini (deep fried zucchini chips, served with a marinara sauce) for $3.99.

The chicken was moist and seasoned lightly.  The rice was a little oily and having the flat bread gives another texture component.  The salad was served with a Greek vinaigrette.  Although the shish kabobs were served with the same sides.  The ground beef, although flavorful, was a little dry.  The zucchini was super crunchy and offered a lot of texture to the dish.  The marinara sauce was really runny, so when I dipped the zucchini chips, nothing really stayed on the chip.  

All in all, the place was a good choice for dinner.  For being a fast food joint, Manna did make a delicious meal.  Kudos for the quick and tasty!Tried Bar Tepo for the first time tonight, thought it was pretty decent. I had heard from a friend that the Brown Sugar Hoisin Chicken Tacos were good so my wife and I tried them off of the tapas menu, they were very good. My wife commented that she would order the tacos from the dinner menu where they are also available. For dinner my wife had the Chicken Caesar Salad, the chicken was cooked very nicely with good seasoning, but the salad itself (at risk of sounding snobbish) was rather pedestrian. I had the Prime Rib Sandwich which was a really a French Dip sandwich. The sandwich was good but in my mind misrepresented on the menu. 

My problem with this restaurant is that it is not sure what it wants to be. The decorating is very high end, but the food we received does not reflect the atmosphere. We will definitely be back and try the food again, hopefully I can raise my rating of this place. I really want it to be good.Looks like a cool place (a lot bigger than it looks on the outside) with a pretty big menu.  Food was pretty average and coffee was as well.

Service was really friendly though.A big group of friends went recently because this was her favorite restaurant of all time.

The food was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. The pasta was really al dente which I liked but I wasn't blown away by the sauce or the meatball. Again, it was all pretty good but it wasn't really worth the high price.

The oreo dessert we got at the end was probably my favorite of all the items we got.

3.5 stars overall but decided to go with a 3 because of the unwarranted high price.Mediocre food in a trendy atmosphere. Expected a good meal, instead got dry and over salted chicken parm. Waiter never checked with us on how the meal was after it was dropped off by the runner. Manager came over with attitude to inquire on our complaint, but barely acknowledged it. Eat elsewhere, then come for the drinks upstairs.The Willow House has lots of unrealized potential.

It looks like a hostel as much as it does a coffeehouse from the approach.  I was expecting to see a garden variety of drifting McCrustersons sprouting from the porch and was queerly disappointed when there was not.

The interior is run-of-the-mill ordinary.  The menu is pretty lean for breakfast; muffin, bagel, or something like a muffin or something like a bagel.

My friend and I got bagels and cream cheese. Her with coffee and I with earl grey.  The bagel was not really toasted enough and the cream cheese was 2 prepackaged "PHILADELPHIA" pouches dropped on my plate.  Jen said the coffee was ok and I suppose I could say the same about my earl grey--simply a tea bag in a mug of hot water.

Despite the subparness of the eats and drinks, there are a few things that are really positive about The Willow House.  Such as:

+++Free Wi-Fi+++
Not only free, but blazing fast Wi-Fi and no silly password or time limits.

+++Vinyl Digging+++
Their is a coat closet filled with 12" albums covering a good range of musics and qualities POOR to VERY GOOD and maybe some NEAR MINT if you really dig. The price was reasonable too with $1 per one or $6 for an entire crate (50+ LPs)!!!

+++Local Resource+++
The local rag is there as well as flyers for DIY shows and even a Crispin Glover speaking event.  This is pretty ordinary, but still always commendable when these types of resources are getting fewer and fewer with big box infiltration.  Not every biz allows free advertising space for DIY artists and musicians.

+++Outdoors***
Red picnic tables are scattered around in the side lawn of The Willow.  True that in Phoenix, comfortable outside dining time is limited. Near these tables there is also this wall comprised of beautiful metal panels all colorfully weathered, rusted, and corroded.  Perhaps I am biased with my unorthodox rust-belt view of what true beauty is.--But I find it so and i write so and so it is.

***Cats***
I am a gigantic catfag in every way.  Outside, next to the picnic tables there was a concrete garden bench and under this bench was. EEEEEKKKK!!!  A mussy mess of black and white cat keeping her cool.  She was a very skanky looking cat and I was smitten.  I instantly made her a little song as I sung to her and took photos . I think, "Dusty Desert Skanky Cat" was part of the lyrics and it was a tad Pete Seger sounding.  I later learned that that was a momma cat that the employees of The Willow House named Thundercat and there are other cats that climb a tree to bathe in the morning.  Yeah, I can see myself returning for the pussy and pussy alone.

I hope that The Willow House uses these posi things to build themselves a better tomorrow.I'm extremely selective on the buffets I will go to. This place was bad the food was bland and just did not taste good at all. There was one thing that I eat that I thought was good it was a turkey stuffing soup. But for close to 25$ the food should of been better. I gave it an extra star because my wife does enjoy the food here.I ordered a pepperoni pizza, garlic knots and chocolate cannoli. I didn't like the pizza. It was really greasy and the bottom of the pizza was soggy. Also the cheese seemed very heavy. The garlic knots were good but different. They seemed fried  rather than baked. The best part was the cannoli! OMG they are to die for!  Next time I'll try a pasta dish rather than pizza.Bacon blue cheeseburger and onion rings with cayenne ranch. Nice location for sitting outside, not a lot of traffic noiseMy boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted a sit down place to relax, eat and get out of the heat for a bit. He suggested Applebee's so off we were to get some grub. I have not been to an Applebee's in a very very long time.

We ordered the two for twenty deal, I got the Fiesta chicken and he ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken dish which includes one appetizer to share so we went with the mild buffalo wings (boneless) with ranch.

The meal was good and the service was pleasant as we had a sweet waitress who called us kids, I thought it was cute. 

I probably won't step foot into Applebee's for another year or so.I got a gel manicure here and I didn't leave impressed. 

On first impression, the salon is larger than many I have been to and everything appears cleans. I arrived without an appointment and someone was there to do my manicure right away, which is also a plus. Also, being at Tempe Marketplace makes it very convenient. However, I felt like my manicure was rushed. The lady trimmed my nails well, as I asked her to do, but I feel like they could have been filed a lot better. Immediately upon getting home I re-filed them myself in order to make them more straight and get rid of some of the sharp edges. I also feel like she missed the sides of some of my nails, as well as some of the tips. A nail or two even look slightly chipped as a result, but my own filing helped correct that some. There was also no massage of any sort, she just put some lotion on in the end, so that was disappointing.  In the end, I don't think it was worth the $30 I was charged. I have been to other places that have done a better, more thorough, job for the same price.While I make no hesitation to criticize some other campus skeezeries on State Street and University Avenue, I am hesitant to do so with the Stadium, because what you see is what you get at the Stadium Bar.  It is your typical sports bar that can be found in towns small and cities large.  There are big screens a plenty, bar food galore, and volleyball in the summer. Game days is when this place truly shines, it's packed with a crowd of many ages and often rooting for opposing teams -- but everyone can agree that they really do need that Leines in a can or to throw up in the porta potty before they do a shot from that grandpa who loves Penn State.

If you're a 45 year old alumni and drunk at 6 am on game day -- The Stadium was BUILT for you. Enjoy!New to Vegas I was looking for Persian food, most of all Kabob. After living in Los Angeles I have had my fair share and know good Kabob and persian food. I decided to order Kabob and gheimeh. The kabob was good but the ghemeh was mediocre at best. The price was certainly higher than what I have paid for in the past, especially given the service and the ambiance.Pretty chill spot. Outdoor patio seating had people. Fourth of July so it wasn't busy. Sat inside and enjoyed the Mac and cheese. No complaints about the food but I wasn't wowed. The service was fine.NIce and clean. Big selection of prepared food. A lot of hard to find items. Expensive as usual.

This is the location they filmed one episode of "Top Chef" from bravo.I chose BLT for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. We were given a  table with an excellent view and our server started off great. He recommended a few different cocktails and told us about the daily specials.

 

The popovers were amazing and I loved that they gave us the recipe to them. I'm eager to try and recreate these masterpieces in my own kitchen.

My oysters were fresh, the sides we chose (the asparagus and the Potato Gratin) were both were excellent.

 
The only problem was our steaks were barely luke warm when we received them. They were cooked to our preferences, but both were almost cold. We attempted to send them back but it seemed at that point our waiter disappeared. After several minutes of trying to make eye contact with someone working we decided to just eat before the rest of our food got cold.
 
I had great expectations for BLT, unfortunately the cold steaks and lackluster service at the end will not justify a return visit. I'm still going with 3 stars, because steaks aside everything else was great.Grilled Double Cut Bacon for an appetizer....enough said!  Sooooooo Yummy!
Tuna Tartare w/ Avocado & Soy-Lime Dressing.....OMG!!
The steaks and sides are Fabulous!
Everything we had to eat was fantastic....so why not a 4 or 5 star rating?
Well, that would have to be the service.  The service was good, but not what you would expect to have at a 5 star restaurant.  
Also, when we received the bill the staff had added someone else's drink order to it.  Mistake?  Maybe, or a way to give someone great free, on the house service by having someone else pay by slipping it into the bill.  Thank God we check out our itemized bill before we pay!
I won't be back and neither will the other 5 people I was dining with that night because of that, to bad because the food was outstanding!Saturday night, prowling around the Mekong Plaza. I was sadly disappointed by the Tet festival. Determined to have fun regardless I decided to check owhat else the plaza had to offer. I'm glad that I did because this place is filled with hidden gems.

I was drawn in by the window advertisement for boba/bubble tea. I had seen this before on one or another of the discovery/travel channel shows.

After staring at the board forever and asking the poor kid at the register for recommendations I grabbed a honeydew with boba. 

The drink was very fresh and did not taste as if it had added sugar. The boba was a fun experience with a hard to explain the texture. I would say its almost like gummy bear texture but in little round balls. After a few drinks of mine I recruited a friend to come and try another flavor. He got the coconut/pineapple which was the other flavor I almost got. He had zero complaints about his and liked it very much.

The food the other patrons ordered looked and smelled amazing. I wish that I had some more room in me so that I could give it a try. Their menu is HUGE and the prices are very reasonable. I want to get back here sometime with a decent sized group to get a large variety of items.

The front of the store was manned by a Mom,son, and daughter team who were all very nice. The lady even gave this little girl a free bubble tea while I was there.

This could easily be upgraded to a 4+ star if the food tastes as good as it smells.This place is ok, not great and missed the wow-factor for me.  I'm a native, born and raised on carne asada, I'll probably die with a burrito in hand. 

As you will see, there are a lot of gringos in this place at lunch time.  Here's a clue for the white folks, good Mexican foods can be found where the Mexicans eat.  

Again, don't get me wrong, this place is ok... just didn't deserve all the hype.A very popular bakery that serves breakfast bagels and lunch pizza.  You serve yourself and pay into a box.  Get there early, because they run out of their very limited selection quickly.Mixed emotions; decor was nice with comfortable chairs and a nice selection of books. Service was friendly when I could get it - at one point I was the only person in line for 5 minutes, then when others where in line they were helped as if I'd never been standing there. Another time, had to ask twice after a long wait for a beverage, it was never made. First coffee was good, refill was luke warm and tasted like it had been sitting a while. Pastry was decent, wi-fi strength was good.This is why I typically wait until I've been to a restaurant more than once to write a review. Consistency means a lot - I don't care if the service is consistent, but the food should be. Especially if you're trying to sport a "healthy eco-friendly" image capable of reaching naysayer-veggie-haters that have only had bad experiences with healthy cuisine. My experience would certainly not have convinced any timid diners that they should try new foods. Which is unfortunate and makes me sad as a healthy food lover.

My first experience in February was absolutely lovely. Went for a friend's birthday and had the private room in the back. I ordered the green tea soba noodles with tofu and extra veggies - simply delicious. Everything I wanted...light, healthy, flavorful and a good glass of wine to boot. Service was spectacular and dessert was delightful.

My second experience really let me down. Fine if the service wasn't outstanding, I can get over my awkward waitress. The wine was fine. The food was not. I ordered the roasted vegetables with farro. Both the veggies and farro were undercooked and barely lukewarm. I don't like mushy vegetables, but al dente would be nicer to my jaw. And PS - those weren't figs. Definitely not figs.

I'd like to go back and try something else on the menu to see if this was just an off night, so for the time being I will deposit this mediocre review in hopes to have my confidence restored next time.Decent food not amazing, liked the atmosphere however they charge extra for everything. Only one free refill per visit, and extra for the containers to go.The Highs:

- Wide array of events and gigs covered, for all over Scotland (so it's not just a clever name!).
- Tickets available for purchase and/or collection right up until only a couple hour before the actual event.


The Lows:

- Fees are a bit of a joke; booking fees charged per ticket, and also an additional 'collection fee' for tickets purchased online.
- Opening hours aren't very working-class-friendly.
- Given this day and age, they should really have an alternative method of distribution for those unable to get to the office for collection within aforementioned opening hours.

Highs 2/Lows 3

B-I've been here for a couple of nights out and the cocktails are good and the music is cool! A bit crowded and full of a lot of posers taking selfies but if you can handle that then its a good place to start your night!I made up my mind that I would eat fish and chips no more than twice during my eight-day trip to Scotland, and unfortunately I chose the Beehive as one of the spots.  It was okay, just not great.  Everyone expects bland peas, but the fish and chips themselves were boring too.  

However, sitting outside with my meal, beer, and the Daily Independent on a late-May evening when it was still warm and daylight, people-watching the various foot traffic in the Grassmarket--that was one of the most pleasant hours of the vacation. 

One other note--the Edinburgh Literary Pub tour departs from the Beehive.This review is based on several visits as a couple and lastly on a visit with a Christmas night out. of around 30 people. 

American diner, serving American style food in reasonable to big portions. Alongside cocktail and American style beers (and Tennent's)
Should I stop here? I could. Perhaps I should not to put you off. Still interested? OK. 
The place is big, 2 floors and 2 bars and many tables and booths. The main bar on the ground floor is where the till works, the downstairs bar it has been kaput for absolutely donkeys years. So when eating downstairs you need to order at the table (group of 4 or less? no sweat) or go upstairs and wait, wait, wait... wait some more to get served. Just for your information, a corona is £3.95 - yes .. a pint of Guinness is £3.20 - Pretty expensive for an MotR American diner.. We were on a prepaid meal of about 30 people we didn't want the hassle of divvying up the drinks bill so we had to go to the upstairs when thirsty. This lead to many people arriving to cold starters or mains.. 
Granted they offered to open a bill per table, but unbeknownst to us we opted for ordering at the bar..

The food was well received (especially the salmon and pesto pasta) but mostly bland. Or overuse of sauce (do I taste BBQ sauce - again?) salads and coleslaw sides - nah. 

The food service was speedy and accurate (remembering each dish ordered belonging to whomever ordered it as a preorder. well done!)

however i will not be back in a hurry.I love this place, I really do so it pains me to say anything negative about it, but I must admit: the service is below par. They're just .. really, really slow. You can easily stand beside the counter for a couple of minutes waiting for a table, and then have someone pop over to you asking if they can help you with anything (in a slightly puzzled look). Well, since there's a sign asking me to wait to be seated, yes you can!

But the thing that really bothered me the last few times I was here was the lack of hygiene, spotty subject, I know. But when I find dust in my teacup, we've got an issue, and I don't just mean a cleaning issue. We've got a caring issue.
I love this place, but in order for it to be great, the staff must love it as well and take care of it as if it's their own.

Now, this might just have been the winter blues for the past 2 months but come on people, step up your game! I'm rooting for you here!Jenny Ha's is dead; long live Kilderkin.

Okay so not much bar the name has changed it would seem. Layout-wise Kilderkin is still homely, comforting and rustic. Perfectly situated at the bottom end of the Royal Mile, a few strides from tourist-magnet the Scottish Parliament.

Prices seem reasonable and, for the beer drinkers especially, the range seems quite eclectic. Kilderkin seem to have an unofficial relationship with Stewarts Brewery, so expect to see the latter's wares in the chillers behind the bar.

Staff are pretty grounded in a no frills sort of way; not overly friendly, not overly polite, but in now way dismissive or uninviting. It's almost like visiting a relative's place for a beer or lunch, the straightforwardness of their approach. Very refreshing actually.

And so... the food. Kilderkin doesn't sport the most diverse menu, but as the saying goes, it's short and sweet. Scottish gastro classics are present and correct alongside a couple of irregular options such as Quesadillas and Tikka Masala. I would recommend both the Haggis, Neeps and Tatties, or the Kilderkin Burger, a pork and spring onion patty, served on a thick grilled bun. Very tasty indeed. Most mains vary between £4-8.

All in all a decent spot for a quick and cheap lunch. Or a not so quick drink in the warm and comfortable bar.A perfectly serviceable and cozy option on the Royal Mile. It's inoffensive and the tourists will probably love it, as it's stacked with Scottish feeling. 

One niggle is the seating, which I always feel there isn't enough of. The pub itself has a nice atmosphere, but the long galley style means that seating is stacked up against one side of the room and there's not really all that many spots to pull up a pew. 

However, it's a friendly little place, and location-wise is well oriented. Nice spot for a catch up with a friend.I realise that there's nothing that remarkable about a Hard Rock Cafe in itself, or there being one in Edinburgh for that matter, but seeing as they are pretty different depending on what city you're in, I thought this establishment and tourist magnet of worldwide recognition would be worth reviewing.

When I lived in Barcelona for a while, I actually used to hang out in the Hard Rock Cafe there quite a lot, which I never thought I would find myself doing. It turned out that the cocktails were amazing, and just the right level of potent, and the banter was great because there was always such a mix of people milling around. The premises were also huuuuge, and with a pretty striking HQ right on the central square in the middle of Barcelona, it was quite hard not to enjoy the whole thing.

I suppose that's why I find Hard Rock Cafe in Edinburgh a little bit underwhelming, but I suppose it's not totally fair to compare it to the one in Barcelona, it's not its fault it's small and feels a wee bit cramped. The mix of tourists and locals, blasting rock music, huge portions of food and hard hitting cocktails are all here though, and I do enjoy all of those things. Sometimes a large portion of nachos or a hefty burger and chips is just the ticket.Mmmm....pussit.  Love me some purple squid.  Had some chicken caldereta too and it was good.  My mom enjoyed the sinigang and fried tilapia.  Kind of small portions for the price but I guess it's a little more expensive because it's on the strip.  A good selection of to go Filipino food.  Place is clean but nothing fancy.  

Free parking in the back, enter on the small lot right before the Hawaiian Marketplace.My cousin insisted I try the longhorn burger...my mouth was ready but I was disappointed....I broke my diet to eat this burger that was greasy...I can say the sweet potato fries were okHad the Singapore spicy noodle and salt-n-spicy soft shell crab.  The noodle was ok, a bit on the bland side.  The crab was tasty.  It was soggy by the time it was delivered, but I wonder if it'd be crispier at the restaurant.  Price was comparable to other Chinese restaurants at around GBP 7-9 per dish.  I'd give it an extra half stars for its super quick delivery.This little shop seems to cram quite a few books into its space without seeming cluttered.  It is simply wall-to-wall books packed tightly into the shelves.  They also put out a sale box on the stoop without too much fanfare, and are open a bit later than I would expect (it was early evening but I don't remember the exact time).  The proprietor was painfully indifferent on the day that I was there but that's par for the course with bookstore owners.  Lots of fiction here.Quite small and in a fairly grim setting, you can sometimes forget this branch of New Look is so close to the high street. I actually spent a good while over the past fortnight doing just that, and wandered the length of Princes Street twice looking for it.

When I eventually remembered it was here, I was fairly disappointed since it's quite a small branch. Selling a number of really long maxi dresses just now, I've got to say I thought this New Look were selling the cheaper looking stuff that the shop often sells. It's an odd high street store, because you usually can either find some absolutely stunning skirts made of good quality material, or some really naff, fake frilly summer frocks that look like they haven't been ironed. This isn't particularly to do with this New Look, it's common of all of them. It just seemed there was more of the latter on display in this branch, but that's probably to do with the limited space this unit has.

They did have some of their sale stock still available, and their London range can be found at the back of the store which is a good contrast against the heavily pastel coloured window displays. They also had a number of "going out" dresses, high heels and, if you're wanting to go casual, an amazing jeans collection. 

The staff were helpful and really efficient, while also seeming to enjoy their job. That's why I don't want to slag this outlet off too much. It just seems, sadly, that they can't showcase New Look's best bits to their full potential because they are hindered by the size. It would be nice to see this central shop take its place on Princes Street proper, rather than be hunched up in here. I'm not the biggest fan of Princes Mall - it's a bit run down for a shopping centre set in the heart of town, and I feel like this New Look may be overlooked by many because it's stuck in here. If it had room to stretch out and sell a more extensive range of clothing  that the other stores boast, it would fair better. Move to Princes St, you will prosper!Awesome experience. Everything is ice, even the cups! 

From my druken memory i believe it was $75 total wait, or was it $85 (uh oh) , for two people.
 This includes two drinks per person and they provide a jacket and slippers also.
1. Fruit fusion - fruity and wasn't too strong.
1. Icy margarita - you can definitely taste the alcohol .

They have this outrageous rule that doesn't allow you to bring your camera inside because they claim that the " condensation" will mess it up. BULLCRAP. If that was the case, then WHY do they take pictures with their cameras inside and charge 20 dollars per picture.  In other words, they want to make more money by lying to you. hahahaa. We didn't believe it and took a few pictures with our own camera til we were forced to put it into the locker. ( the pictures and the camera came out fine) hehee. 

Overall, a pleasant experience.  Something to definitely stop by and try with a date or a group of friends.  

1 out of 5. 5 being the highest.
Drinks - 3.5
Ambiance - 4
Price - DecentIt's hard to know where to start with this review, because there was nothing that hugely stood out as being wrong with the 2 times I've eaten here. It's just that there was also nothing that stood out as being fantastic about them, either.

Maybe I'm too picky; they already have 4 branches across Edinburgh and one in Aberdeen, so they're obviously doing something right. I'd say this is most likely to be down to the the emphasis placed on local ingredients from local suppliers. For example, in my Trio Of Seafood starter, the "fragrant poached salmon" that came alongside the pickled herring and seared scallops was one of the nicest bits of salmon I've tasted in a long time. Likewise, my main course of Lamb Rump was sourced from the scottish borders and was extremely well-cooked.

That aside, when you scan down the menu you can't help but think that none of the dishes are particularly any different to what you'd find in any british restaurant, regardless of where the actual ingredients come from: other options for main course were a beef steak burger with blue cheese served with chips, or a butternut squash gnocchi dish served with grated parmesan on top... hardly anything hugely imaginative and yet you'll still pay up to £17 for a main/£7 for a starter.

Don't get me wrong, both times I've eaten here have been good. It's just that "good" is about as excited as you can get. In somewhere like Bruntsfield, which has so many restaurants, bistros and brasseries, Howies does seem to fade from your memory fairly quickly after you leave.Just make sure you have time on your hands to get to see this tour. We arrived and it was booked for 3 hours. Luckily it was lunch time so we headed over the road and came back for our tour. 

The tour itself was fun, the guide in full period costume was the daughter of Old Mary who the close is named after. She really hammed it up and played the part very well while taking us one a tour round the close. Initially is was a bit disorientating what the close was with the rooms you went in first and I didn't fully understand the l;ayout until the end when you get to the street.

Surprisingly, I learned a lot about the history of Edinburgh and it gives you a real feel for the people of the time. There are also sound effects, life-size recreations and eerie lighting, and jumpy bits. We only spent about five minutes in the actual close but it was very interesting although I was not bothered about getting a photo. That being said, it was very entertaining and I would go back next time we have visitors. The gift shop was also really good with some great souvenirs.A mishmash of just about any household item you could possibly get your hands on lies in this tacky, musty smelling establishment.  If your in need of cheap ironing boards, light fittings, stationary etc then it's worth having a good old root around this place. 

Patrons should be weary that it's not quality that this place aims for, more like quantity. I bought a £3 landline telephone from here once and it's managed to stay intact and in good working order throughout many of the flats I've lived in whilst in Edinburgh.

Perfect for those cheap temporary items that will do until you can afford the better quality replacement.The tights they sell here are the kind of tights that could give a grannie a headache. I'm not a fan, but that's because I'm easily visually affected by bright things. For example, girls who walk around in so much fake tan they look like doritos. Or neon pink. They both scare me. 

But Pie in the Sky actually has a pretty cool range of clothing. I don't go often for the same reason I never go often to places that sell pretty things I can't afford. I mean, they once upon a time had a sales box and I got myself a dress from there, but that's only because it cost a fiver and I could afford to do that. It's definitely a great place to go if you feel like you can splurge.This place is overpriced but yummy. We came here on a whim for lunch and the service was great and there is a wide selection of margaritas to choose from which is nice. The white peach was very good!

The little tacos are not worth 13-15 for three though. I dunno, they were okay but could use some sour cream and guacamole..., just my opinion. 

The spareribs were yummy and we ordered the appetizer sampler which we didnt eat the tamale, it wasn't all that great, but the litle taquitos and nachos were.

Come here with an open mind and you will be okay!Came here with a bachelorette party of 9.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but it did fit with the utilitarian feel of the Luxor.  We were hoping for a lively vibe, but it was pretty quiet and dull.  The food was decent.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I won't be rushing back here.For quite a few years I dismissed River Island as a shop selling over priced, cheap looking clothes to chavs and tarts. This branch was given a make-over relatively recently and since then, my opinion has been changed. The brand seems to have taken a different, edgier direction - some of the clothes put me in mind of All Saints, but without the exorbitant and unjustifiable prices. I bought some fantastic mid length lace-up boots (very similar to an All Saints pair) in October and they were barely off my feet until they fell apart a few weeks ago; I walk everywhere, so six months is a good innings for footwear. There's no student discount, but there are some excellent sale bargains to be found if you can be bothered rifling through the rails - a few months back I found a pair of smart harem pants for £2.Situated in the Southside is this handy wee stationery shop. There aren't enough stationery shops like Newington Stationers. I love stationery! Seriously once for Christmas when I was a child I just asked for stationery. One of the best Christmas' ever. 

I digress. In fact I am surprised there aren't more stationery shops, especially in studenty areas. Unfortunately this isn't  really a student stationers. Despite what others have said, when I ventured in the stock seemed to be lacking.  I didn't find a wide selection of all kinds of pens, protractors and quality notebooks. Instead expect more newsagents standard. A few pencil case basics, some standard paper plus some birthday cards and other bits and pieces. Newington Stationers doess offer a handy scanning and printing services.

This isn't a bad shop though, as long as you know what to expect you won't be disappointed.My brothers were obsessed with roller blading. They've moved onto snowboarding you'll be glad to know, but it meant that a lot of my youth was spent in here. 
This is your typical skateboard shop. Full of Japanese names and baggy jeans, if you're going through puberty / never really grew up this is your place.This place used to be a cool little joint just down the street on King that had a lot of character. Now, it's still the only place to get decent sushi in Madison. I really like sushi, so I went somewhat regularly over my 4 years in Madtown, but if you're not from the Midwest, then you will not be impressed.The food and serivce was great- very fast service.Food was awesome! However could have been much better service. We were last party to eat and my friend appetizer which was the 1st item ordered was totally dismissed.pretty good food here, the brownie dessert was fantasticOur company Christmas party was held here. I wasn't impressed by a few things. 

First we awoke at 7:14 am to someone pounding on the door and attempting to put a key in!!!  My husband quickly demanded an answer as to who it was from our side of the door and a hotel employee explained he was sorry that it was an error and the system shows this room as available and he was trying to show a guest to their room. We laid back down and the employee continued to have a very LOUD conversation over his two-way radio with the office to figure things out. Hello people!!!!  It's 7:15!  I could have stayed home and slept in later than this!  After about 10 mins of this (now the customer is arguing with the hotel employee because he's angry) my husband finally asked them to "take it somewhere else so we could sleep".

We lie back down and try to go to sleep. Upon starting to doze suddenly the TV automatically turns on with the volume extremely loud!  The remote was literally across the room so there is no way we even touched it!  Weird. 


Now wide awake on my one day to sleep in I decided I wanted to make coffee... it took me forever to find the Keurig stored away in a cabinet below the TV. It was a large tray that contained the coffee maker and condiments. There was no place to plug it in!  I literally had to move a dining chair over to the wall near an outlet so I could make coffee. Whew!  That was an ordeal but coffee was brewing and I would soon be enjoying a cup on the balcony. NOT!  No creamer. Nope not any creamer of any kind to be found. Period. So I decide upon coffee via room service or at least some creamer!  I can't find the menu. I call down to dining and she explains that the menu is on the TV. Fine. I fiddle around with that for about 5 more mins and finally get the menu up. It's impossible to see because it is in extremely small black font. (Not very well thought out for a resort of this cost!). 

Forget it....we will go to the dining room Prado. We shower and off we go. We get there and the host isn't anywhere to be found. At this point I seriously need coffee so we seat ourselves and wait. The host now sees us (Frank) and comes over and introduces himself and in a very confrontational manner says "what is your last name and room number please."  We tell him and he marches off check it out to be sure we are credible. 

After all of that I am waiting for this resort to call and let me know that they owe us a free night!  I think it's the least they can do. And they should include a couples massage package so my next review will be singing their praises rather than this type of review!  Make it right Montelucia!  We are counting on it.Good place to take someone that can eat a ridiculous amount of food. The waiters hovered which was kind of annoying. Sangria was ok. They really pushed it and was a bit over priced. Otherwise the meats were good. Some kind of bland. Salad bar was nice but don't bother eating too much over there and wait for all those meats. Earlier the better. It gets a tad crazy there and you have to wait for the good stuff. You can request something on the list but dont hold your breath. They never did get back to us once it started getting busier so we just paid and left. Was an experience but just ok. Lamb chops were my favorite.We enjoyed lunch here last weekend. I liked the complimentary Parmesan potato chips and thought the Indulge cheeseburger I had was good. I would go back to try some other menu items. I thought service was good and liked the decor. If you are in the neighborhood it is worth a try to see how it measures up to your tastes...indulge yourself.OK. The owner contacted me and was rather disconcerted about my one star rating and review. He should genuine interest in ameliorating the problem and expressed thanks for my review information to help him do so. He seems to be an owner who really does care and doesn't just discount a review as "some idiot out there" as many owners do. I raised the review from 1 to 3 stars because of his pro-activeness. He offered for me to come in when he was working to discuss the matter further. I will probably go back in again and amend the score if it warrants.My husband and I came here for lunch the other day after we had heard some good things from co-workers. I feel like this place is trying to be a hip and gourmet burger joint - sort of like Delux Burger - but falls short. The location is decent and I like all the windows. The color scheme is blue and there's plenty of burger artwork inside. However, the inside seems a little cramped. You definitely have to do some maneuvering to get to a table all the way in the back of the restaurant (or the restrooms). There are plenty of tables and a short booth section, but then there are screens than hang from ceiling to floor and that makes it even more difficult to navigate. Lucky for us, we sat all the way in the back and had to do some fancy dancing to get back there. 

The waitress was nice and attentive. She answered any questions I had about the burgers and was quick to take our order. They have a lunch special for $9.95. This includes a burger (or sandwich), fries, and a drink. You have to choose from a list of burgers/sandwiches, but they have a wide variety. I thought about getting the chicken or veggie sandwich, but went with the standard classic - cheeseburger. I ordered sweet potato fries and since it comes with a drink, received an ice tea. My husband ordered almost the same, but got regular fries instead. 

Our food came rather quickly and looked good. The patty was a little thinner than my husband normally likes, but compared to some places it was decently sized. The flavor was good - tasted meaty and no real spices. I liked the cheese they used, real cheddar cheese, and I think this was my favorite part of the burger. My husband didn't really care for his burger, wishing it had more flavor. His fries were okay - nothing special. However, I really liked my sweet potato fries, which came with a cinnamon marshmallow sauce. The sauce, I didn't really care for. It was waaay too sweet and looked unappetizing.  

Overall, I don't know if we'd come back for lunch, unless we were in the area. The happy hour looked decent and I do love an adult milkshake (or just a chocolate malt!) so I might come back to try. I might not indulge with burgers, but I definitely can try with dessert!My friends and I were in town for Spring Training and were looking for breakfast place walking distance to the stadium.  DD caught my eye on N. Scottsdale Rd. since it was bustling with action.  Tired and slighty hungover we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised with the food.  I thought the food was good and the service was very good.  Attentive server who as friendly and got our day off to a good start.  One thing I can't be sure of is if the Spring Training crowd slowed the kitchen down.  The food did take over 20-25 min to come out but when your having a bloody mary and trying to remember things from the past night that wait goes by fast!When Cafe Carumba closed last year I started going to Daily Dose. They have good food, a nice (but small) patio, and a good location. I normally come here for breakfast during the week because it's less busy and crammed. They have a very small patio so on the weekends it feels like there is no breathing room and you're forced to listen to five other conversations going on around you at other tables. The service also gets really slow on the weekends. I was there one Saturday and I actually got my food before my mimosa. And that's not because the food was quick, actually I remember the food taking a long time too. I had to order my second mimosa when the server dropped off the first one just to make sure it came before our meal was over. Pity too because I absolutely love mimosas and would normally drink more than just two with breakfast. So far everything i've tried at Daily Dose has been pretty tasty. They've got a great pancake selection, and you have the option to have them made from a honey wheat batter. As for lunch, I always get the same thing. It's a grilled chicken sandwich on a deliciously soft pretzel bun. It's the pretzel bun that keeps me coming back. Normally, I would branch out a little and try other lunch entrees. As for the service at Daily Dose, it's always the same. The servers always seem annoyed. I actually went there this morning with a few girl friends and we ordered hot chai teas that came room temperature. We told the server they weren't hot and asked her to please warm them up for us, we even told her she could nuke them in the microwave and she told us they didn't have a microwave and then asked us if we had tried them yet. Of course we tried them, that's how we know they are not hot. I don't think i've ever really had good service there. Of course, despite all that I still go to Daily Dose on a regular basis. They've got good food, free wi-fi, and a good location.I had a good time there, the brunch was good, was fun and it was a lil different. the service was not so bad. it is kind of small, so we had to wait 25 mnts for our table. they should have a bigger waiting room than that little room that fits 5 people. i would go back, just earlier. again good breakfast big, u can even share it HA, the food tasted fresh, the juice was maybe fresh squeezed..... sure will be back .!!This is probably the only decently good quick place to eat at when staying at the palazzo. I've had a couple of things here before on the togo menu; the fettuccini alfredo which taste dry and thick, but the chicken is good if you add it in, could probably feed two people, any of the pizza selections are pretty good, chicken bites are satisfying and will do your stomach some justice before heading out. While dining in, the menu is huge, honestly there is so much to choose from, I kind of see that as a bad thing, makes people take a long ass time to order, but I ordered the Zen noodles which was like thai noodle soup, it was ok, soup was pretty decent, they don't pour all the soup in and leave it in a cup in case you want to poor the rest, it isn't huge, but I didn't expect that it would be.Wife and I tried it out today with mixed reviews. I had the gyro, which came with a small amount of fries. The gyro was very good. The fries not so much.
The gyro had lots of meat and small amount of the rest of the filling. At many places it's the opposite.
My wife had the deluxe combo (which I intended to sample), that had chicken, beef, pork, with rice and Greek salad and a pita.
The beef, which was tasty, was stringy and super tough, so denture wearers, steer clear of it ;-)
The pork, again while tasty, was 80 percent fat, with a bit of edible meat.
The chicken, once again tasty, was very dry. 
The salad and rice were OK.

The gyro was $9 dollars and the combo, 13+. Way too much for the overall quality of the food.

My impression, being an excellent cook, is that the recipe and flavour was good, but they used the least expensive cuts of meat which plummeted the overall quality.

So it's yes to the gyro, but no to the chicken, beef, and pork.I have to say I was a little disappointed with XS. First they made all of my girls pay (we were 6 girls) a high cover. Not cool when drinks are $18 bucks a pop or over!

Second the dance floor was a hot mess with no hot men in sight. I don't know if it was an off day or Paris Hilton scared everyone away, but it's summer time on a Saturday night....where are the good looking guys? 

Oh and let me mention the $18 drink that had almost no booze, and I'm talking about an AMF here. I'm a small girl and I couldn't even feel it's effect.

On the bright side, they had their hot tub going so I could chill and put my sore feet in after dancing for 6 hours. Dancing on the pool steps was also plus.

We finally found a chill spot near the back of the club where we could spread out and dance, talk and drink. The music finally started getting good around 3 in the morning and lasted about an hour then it went back to the top 40 hits....blah.

Over all, unless they are willing to work with more hosts to be on guest-lists, I'm not coming back.Dazbog Coffee is locate inside The Great Indoor and serves really good coffee. As I've said in my other review, I come here a few times a week and always enjoy the folks behind the counter and the pastries. They also have a flat screen tuned usually to the Food Network or the Golf Channel.Went here on a Wednesday evening after flying for 4 hours from Chicago to AZ: I was hungry and wanted a drink, and was in town for work, but wanted to hang with my friends as well.

long story short: the drinks were weak, the food was awesome (shrimp tacos were infinitely better than I imagined they would be at such a place), it got insanely crowded after about midnight.

If you don't look like a douchebag or aren't wearing heels and a miniskirt you might feel slightly out of place, only reason this place is getting a decent rating is because the tacos were awesome and they have a nice patio.  Get there early if you want to have a good time free of stilettos and sunglasses worn at night.I've been here several times and overall the food is very good.

Sandwiches and burgers in the $7-8 dollar range are above average. I recommend the triple decker reuben sandwich- lots of good quality corned beef- ask them for the dressing on the side though as they tend to drown it. Burgers are good- recommend the patty melt. Downside is the fries are sub par.

I've also tried a couple of their Chinese dinners and they aren't too good IMO- pass on those.

Service is typical Vegas- hit or miss and usually at a snails pace.

The restaurant can get very crowded during peak meal times.This place has come a long way from the early days of the "South Coast" hotel and casino. Back then, after being only open a few weeks, I experienced terrible customer service and mediocre food.

Last night, my cousins and I wanted some late night steak and eggs, so we picked the South Point. I was surprised at the quality of food. The cut of New York steak was visibly better than some others I've had lately. It wasn't the most tender on the inside, but still good. In any case, it's easily one of the better steak and egg graveyard specials in town. My cousins also seemed to enjoy the items they ordered. In particular, they were impressed by the vanilla ice cream.Jack in the Box like most fast food restaurant seem to be hit or miss. All while being completely random when that is. 

Some days, very same jack in the box food can be good. With great service.  On other dayss, at the very same jack in the box the food can be nasty and service down right horrible.

Simply put it's a gamble whenever you go. 

This one is no different.  On some days my order is perfect.  Other days, I cant help but wonder if the food I was given had been sitting in the trash bin and it was served up to me.

Service years actually mostly good. That is always a plus. Getting in and out of the drive through is painless and they always have great shakes. 

Seen that things are always random,  you're pretty much going to be gambling when food and service is good and when it not. So you are on your own.Another food outing with my OG Ryan B and we decided breakfast for lunch was the way to go. We arrived around 12:45 and they weren't busy at all, which is always a plus when I have time constraints. 

Service was friendly and our food came out at lightning speed. I got the avocado and bacon omelette with wheat toast and cottage cheese. I ordered the cottage cheese since I really don't like the potatoes they are famous for but I was a little disappointed to find out that they put that same paprika or whatever it is on the cottage cheese so I'll have to make sure I tell them to skip the seasoning on my next visit. The omelette was good albeit a little too much cheese was added for my personal taste. Another thing I'll have to be a little more careful with how I order my meal for the next time. 

Overall our meal was good and very basic for a breakfast.Saito's is located in an area that seems to be a bust, or at least slow to take off.   The location is unfortunately in the pretencious City North, a small strip of restaurants and posh shops just North of Desert Ridge, which gets tons of traffic.  To survive there, they'd have to keep the prices reasonable, which they have.  A friendly lady named Linh greeted us on multiple occasions, I believe she is related to the original owners back in Florida.  The great thing about Saito's is that they are still independently owned by the same owners, which means, more hands on management, which is needed in this Phoenix market.  

The food was good, the fish is fresh, though the presentation of most dishes a little plain.  The uni is not always available, which tells you about what kind of sushi lovers are in the area...  

They do serve these lobster puffs for about $8, they are are good, they arrive at the table hot and with a sweet sauce that complements the cream cheese to the tee.  

Strange things though... The Japanese daicon was missing.  On all the dishes at one point, no dicon.  Dicon is crucial to cooling off the mouth from a good chunk of Wasabi! 

Overall this place is huge with an impressive bar, the food is well priced, it does have a good a la carte menu.  Let's hope that they can make it on a strip that has vacant lofts above restaurants and businesses, if you want good attention from the staff go for lunch.Food is tasty and the anticipation of what the next course will be makes for an interesting evening.  A 5 course meal is the minimum, first course appetizer last course dessert. Not a place to go if you have a hearty appetite you may be satisfied but you'll be hungry in an hour,  Restaurant week was a good time to try it out  but we won't be going back anytime soon.The World's end is one a pub I have visited quite a few times during my time in Edinburgh. Always busy, this pub has a very cosy atmosphere with it being split in two with both a restaurant and bar part. The bar section is small but provides a great selection of real ales and drinks. Seating is also at a premium so if you come late in the evening it is unlikely you will get a seat. 

The restaurant on the other side is also snug, with the warmth from the kitchen being felt through the entire place. The food is very good in here, slightly expensive but well worth it in my opinion. The burgers are very filling and come with generous portions of chunky chips! The fish and chips are good but the fish, when I have been there is always slightly over done! 

A great bar, and a bar which must be on your list of places to visit on the Royal Mile!Taste: 3.5
Creativity/Authenticity: 3
Atmosphere: 4
Service: 3
Bang for your buck: 2

When your hungover as F*#K and in caesars palace this is the place to go to get some hot soup to cure that hangover! been here many times cause im way to hung over to go anywhere and room service doesn't have what you need. soup, noodles everywhere, if your looking for it they probably have it, chinese noodles and soup and chinese food only though (THEY NEED TO SERVE PHO) but anyways i always start with the chinese breadsticks or donut?! than won ton soup with egg noodles cant go wrong, they def use out of the packet egg noodle but its still good, i haven't had any problems with food here but the service is pretty bad; you order, get your food and thats it you will not see your server till your ready to pay? weird or coincidence? Anyways i only go here when im hungover so i cant really give the best rating but so far ive had a decent experience so nothing bad to say hereThought this place was pretty good but I have had better.  My friend ordered the brisket noodle dish and felt that all the meat was fatty and didn't it any of if.  However, the broth and noodles were tasty.  I did enjoy the steamed shrimp dumplings...they were very good.Solid breakfast joint off the Strip. French toast is the best thing we tried. But the breakfast burrito is good too. 

The service is outstanding and they do a good job in keeping the place clean. Other places had a wait of about 30min but this place had us wait a good 20. 

Plenty of strip mall parking.The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).

Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!I am a fro-yo junky, so I was excited to enjoy some FROZEN yogurt on a nice chilly evening.

I was excited to see what flavors they had for me to drool over, but was highly disappointed.  Their apple pie flavor tasted more like pumpkin pie, egg nog was way too sweet, chocolate wasn't chocolatey at all...so I opted for the plain tart.  

Thankfully they had some mango boba and lychee so I was able to satiate that craving.  

We were going to sit inside, but the tables were pretty dirty so we opted to sit outside under some of those portable heaters.

The yogurt is good, they have a decent variety of toppings, but I suggest some more variety of flavors...that is all.I was happy when I came across this little spot not too far from my gate. I ordered a killer breakfast sandwich... when I say killer I mean it. This thing was HUGE. It was on a pretzel bun which was tasty but there was honestly about 8 eggs worth of egg... I mean I guess that is good value. Who complains about too much food right? Well I had to toss a bunch of egg in order to fit this bad boy in my mouth but it was delicious.Person 1: "So, where do you want to go to lunch?"

Person 2: "Hmmm.  I'm not sure"

Person 1: "Want to go to Paradise?"

Person 2: "Naaah, we've been there three times recently."

Person 1: "What about Subway?"

Person 2: "I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . ."

Person 1: "Well, here's Qdoba."

Person 2: "Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work."

That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.

The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . .WE had lunch here because we were in the neighborhood.  Not really our part of town.  We had the $5.75 lunch special, there were 35 choices available!  The restaurant is next door to Chandler BBQ and a nail shop in the Fry's strip mall.  It had half dozen tables but did a bang up take out business.  The place was very clean and the padded chairs were comfortable.  You help yourself to plastic tableware and your cold drinks, straws and fortune cookies.  A similar but much better restaurant would be The Red Dragon about  5 miles north on Alma School Rd.  We had the Orange Chicken which was made with dark meat chicken instead of breast and the sauce was not spicy as indicated on the menu.  It came with 2 tiny pieces of broccoli.  We also ordered pork Egg Foo Young, getting 2 approximately 4 inch pancakes filled mostly with onions and a few tiny pieces of bbq pork.  The brown sauce was served separately  in a paper soup bowl, was a bit pale and didn't have that rich taste I am accustomed to.  The egg foo young was tasty.  With both lunches we chose the pork fried rice (tasted nice, not greasy, large portion) and egg rolls (hot, crunchy, not greasy and rich tasting).  Overall the management was friendly and efficient, parking was easy.  I might go back and try some different dishes, they rate 3 to 3 1/2 stars.For a place called express this place is slow as molasses. I got a combo plate with Kafta and chicken and my buddy a chicken wrap. Took almost 30 minutes to get out food and this was with the place mostly empty at 8pm on a thursday.

The food was very good when we got it but the wait was just too much to overcome.I give Thai Rama 3.5 stars.

A couple of weeks ago, my Denver friend was still in town, and we really like Thai. Had been searching for Thai Elephant because of yelp reviews, but gave up and got desperate and actually located Thai Rama.  The servers were all clearly ASU students and several were working on homework. We came in at a really random pre-dinner hour on a Sunday so we were the only people there, but that was alright.  Prices were reasonable, and service was obviously fast... however, I was deciding between the yellow and panang curry, chose the yellow eventually but was served the panang.  It's okay, though because it was truly delicious... but she didn't really listen to me.  My curry was substantially better than my friend's pad thai, which was very hot, as she requested (two-star "thai hot") but kind of had a strange flavor, different than other pad thai we have tasted.  It wasn't awful by any stretch, but paled in comparison to my awesome panang curry.  The flavor was second to none, and panang curry is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The restaurant itself wasn't special, though the ambiance wasn't too bad.  I'd come back for an inexpensive date night or to have a quick bite with my friends... not to impress any Thai connoisseurs, though.Ok place to grab a good meal.  The place was packed on a Monday night with a short wait.  The salad was ok and the bread, oil, and spices were great.  My meal didn't come out so good.  I ordered the Penne Franco with whole wheat pasta.  The menu said any pasta can be whole wheat...such a deal!!  I was excited.  When my meal came out it was regular pasta.  I asked about it and they said they could remake it, make it to go, or ask to speak to a manager.  I spoke to the manager and she agreed to comp the meal.  I can't believe you can't get what you order here.  She said they only have spaghetti in whole wheat...I don't care!  What a mess.Quite good.  A bit pricey and it was dead when I was there.  That's never a good sign.  The only real complaint is that all the food seems to have meat in it.  Can't you make a couple vegetarian dishes?I LOVE casino coffee shop food!!   It is what it is, so there are NO complaints.  Omelets, hash-browns, toast and coffee--all went down smooth!Scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints: 
Very clean and hip
I had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it's an order and seat yourself sort of deal... It got a little bit packed and was kinda hard to find a seat but we managed to find one... 
I got a coffee, the breakfast blend...
And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes
The burrito itself was really good and flavorful
I didn't like the potatoes, so I just let them sit there 
The service was a little slow but not a big deal at all, I'm very patient and I saw how busy it was
All of the girls working were very friendly and cute
It was a good first experience and maybe next time I will try the breakfast pizzaLunching with my OG Ryan B, we were on the search for something different. I have been to other Ohana locations, but had never tried this location on Eastern. 

I was craving kalbi, so we decided to give this place a try. They have a very extensive menu and plenty of great lunch specials. You can get pretty much every plate in mini / lunch or full size. I came in knowing I wanted kalbi, but I was almost swayed by all the other great options. I eventually went with my initial craving and got the kalbi. 

The food was ready quickly and we grubbed and chatted while we ate. The atmosphere is really nice. Clean and comfortable. I wasn't too in love with the kalbi, wishing it was a little more flavorful, but overall it was still a tasty meal. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll probably be back to try some of their other lunch menu options.My stay at Aria over the weekend was OK but not excellent.  This hotel was really crowded, and they ran out of rooms with double beds and rollaway beds.  Despite we booked our rooms for double occupancy, we did not get it and people in our party had to sleep on couches and on the floor.  I think the hotel still needs some time to run its operation smoothly.

Pros:
- Decor was contemporary.  Everything was new.
- High tech features in the rooms.  You can choose to open the curtain, turn on the TV with a specified channel, and turn on all the lights when you set the alarm clock.  I felt like a queen when I was woken up in style.
- The bath was in the shower.  Interesting design but nice.

Cons:
- Hidden hotel elevators.  We walked pass the elevator banks a couple of time because they are hidden behind the chocolate shop.
- The layout was not clear.  We did not know that there was another side of the casino hidden behind the Players Club until after we checked out.
- No covered walkway from Aria to Crystals Shopping Center.  You have to walk outside to go to the next building.
- $30 to use the fitness center.  The machines and equipments were upgraded from those in the 24-hour fitness.  But nothing special that was worth paying $30 a day to use the facility.Humm.. Well the view was pretty nice.. The kid that parked my car was a doll and kept it up front just like I asked him to. The door man was uh, pretentious and unimpressive. Not sure this would be my ideal living arrangement, food shopping would be a huge pain in the butt, if they close the strip (and they do) you are in it to win it, and STUCK until it reopens, no thanks. If you are a young professional and you can walk to work from here it might be fun for a bit..I definitely think the pizza is flavorful and portions are adequate, however every time I've gone to this location the waiter/waitress has messed up some part of my order. They are personable and nice, but that doesn't compensate for the fact they have never gotten a simple order correct. The service time is poor and the Resteraunt is noisy. But I would go back because of sheer flavor!What can I say, great coffee! I have to be gluten free so I couldn't have the heavenly belgian waffle that everyone is talking about. My wife did and said it truly is heavenly (making sure to rub it in that I couldn't eat it - Grrr!). It was a little frustrating to only really have one thing on their menu that I could order to eat and when it came, I was able to eat it in like 4 bites. It's ok though, I enjoy the place, the atmosphere and next time, I'll come JUST for the coffee cuz ... well... that was great!When you taste the food it takes you to HEAVEN!  Service is so SLOW it takes you to HELL! cant complain about the food. The best Filipino food this side of town. But as i said all the cooking and serving happens at a snail's pace. If you arrive really hungry, prepare to have ULCERS before they bring in your first order. Their sizzling  beef bulalo is 3 out of 5......only because the steak plate it came in was off the shelf-cold and there was no sizzle at all when they served the dish. the meal was good though so i guess that pretty much offsets the lack of SIZZLE in their so-declared SIZZLING bulalo.
Their sizzling fish belly (bangus fish) is EXCELLENT.supposed to be a five but again there was no physical sizzle to what they call Sizzling Bangus Fish.
Their sizzling BISTEK (beef slices) with onions were GOOD. Except for the lack of sizzle.....but again the taste covers up for the missing SIZZLE.
Their tapsilog (beef and egg combination) and bangsilog (fish and egg combination) is supreme and their banana fritters which they call TURON takes you to unparalleled heights of gastronomic nirvana!
They have karaoke which we enjoyed except for the fact that their song selection is so VERY LIMITED.not enough songs. Asian Bistro MUST improve their song selection because their song selection is similar to what a lot of Asians have for HOME USE. There were also some problems with the karaoke system.Sometimes the songs had too slow a tempo....sometimes the tempo was too fast......this so seriously needs to be addressed. Their karaoke is on every wednesday and Friday nights. I wish they would turn it into an every night thing but only AFTER they work on improving and widening their song selection and gets a karaoke jock that actually is musically adept enough to know if the tempo is just about right or if it is way too fast or way too slow. Doesnt take a musical Mozart to be aware of this. It just takes two unclogged healthy ears.
Prices are reasonable.the people were friendly....aint surprished cuz i have read that people from the Philippines are a smiling lot and merrily go about their ways........
Even if their karaoke sound system sucks and even if they dont have the actual sizzle to their 'sizzling" food line-up, this doesnt take away the fact that this is still the best tasting Philippine food this side of the valley.I have been on a mission of sorts to find the best fry bread in the city. This wasn't it, unfortunately. The owners were nice but not too upbeat. The restaurant itself is in a small plaza that is easy to miss when driving by (I know because I've driven by it about 100 times and never noticed it). The interior of Sacred Hogan is a bit run down but appears to be pretty clean. 

I ordered red chili beef stew with plain fry bread. The serving size was fine, but a bit expensive for what it was. I felt like the stew was something I could make at home and probably with more flavor. The fry bread was ok but greasier and chewier than I like.

I might go back to try the tacos or burgers, but I won't be in a hurry to do so.I remember once going into a newly refurbished bar with a friend of mine.  It was beautiful and clean, but she was unimpressed.  "I don't like it," she said.  "It doesn't have character yet." And so it is with Goodyear's new ballpark.  It's fresh and clean and oh-so-sterile. It doesn't even have advertising yet.

And for now, it basically feels like an unfinished Chipotle restaurant.  Fake brown paneling, and lots of silver, gray, and clear tin and other galvanized materials.

The positives: great sightlines, roomy concourse, and lots of amenities for kids, and ... it's a ballfield.

The biggest negative: on the day we went, Cleveland pitchers gave up 17 runs against Milwaukee.  All while Hall of Famer Bob Feller, who recently turned 90, was watching from the stands. It was a miracle the old man didn't have a heart attack.Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a late company Christmas party back in January and it was an okay experience. I usually go to the one in GV and compared to this one, GV has way better service. We constantly had empty drinks and even though we asked for the wheat bread, the waitress kept trying to shove the sourdough down our throats. The only reason I gave this location 3 stars was because of the food, too bad the food couldn't save them to 5 stars.my friend's sister who lives near this place recommended this place while I was in town. I ordered the tropical french toast with Bacon, sausage and 2 over medium eggs. If you're a fan of french toast, you definitely need to try their tropical french toast!  Very generous portions and really good service.Came here because my group was indecisive about what to have for dinner, so what better way to please everyone then to go to a buffet. This one is like any other local casino low key buffet. Food was good and it filled my belly, but nothing spectacular. 

Pros: 
-No wait at all for dinner on a Saturday night
-Good variety: BBQ, Carving station, Mexican, Asian, Italian, Gelato
-Cheap! Get an aliante card and earn yourself some discounts

Cons:
-Quality was medicore
-Some of the food had the appearance of sitting out too longI  rate this as a 3 1/2 stars.  Ive only been here once so far.  The service was great and the menu selection is large.  Good beer selection too.  I had the prime rib dip sandwich.  It was good, but I would not say that it was great (3 stars).   My girlfriend had one of the pasta dishes and enjoyed it. (4 stars).  The portion sizes were good. I will be going back here,  but will be trying something else from the menu.  Hopefully then I can upgrade my rating to 4+.Went here to take my mom to lunch, just curious to try another tex mex restaurant...service was prompt, a bit slow but our service was nice and the complimentary chips/salsa was great. The food was good, not something to go crazy about, my fish tacos were yum but I dunno why they couldn't serve it 1 grilled & 1 beer battered, it has to be either one :-/  but yeah, prices are little high but overall it was ok.The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

I can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?Not nearly as delicious as North Side Nathan's BUT their pizza crust was worth stopping in for. Spaghetti and lasagna portion was normal size and nothing to brag about. The service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Do yourself a favor and call it in even if you decide to eat there.This place is okay, BUT I would hesitate to call it a Pizza place. Maybe if it was specified as flatsbread style pizza than it would get four stars, but when you want pizza and you go to a place that puts toppings  on a cracker it leaves you saying WTF??? Okay so the toppings are awesome, like truffled mushrooms with arugala, very healthy too. My only beef is it is not like a traditional pizza, or even a thin crust, it's a dang cracker. The salads were good too and the service is awesome. All in all three stars, unless you like pizza crackers than bump it up to your liking.If you are in the mood to go to an absolutely beautiful restaurant, this would be the place.  In addition to the beauty of the restaurant, it features an open kitchen which I love as you can watch the staff work their magic.  In addition, you can also see the flaws, our order of gyozas came fresh out of the bag from the freezer into the hot oil.  Honestly, they were not terrible and I am sure making them fresh would be a nightmare, but many restaurants do go to the extra trouble to make them fresh.  

We stuck to the happy hour (Happy hour runs until 7pm) menu and there was a large selection to choose from.   We went with the standards, tempura shrimp roll, spicy salmon roll, and a special roll called a golden blossom that was topped with scallops, all rolls were quite good and priced between $4 and $6 dollars.  Our server was attentive and friendly.I went to Broadway Burger Bar & Grill with my husband, his brother and his brother's girlfriend on a Saturday evening before seeing Zumanity. I am going to need to revisit Broadway Burger Bar & Grill sober so that I can write an update... I was pretty Jagered up by the time we arrived, and can't even comment on the burger I had (I will spare you all the details, haha!). I wasn't too drunk to notice a few things though! 
 
Likes: 
Prices weren't bad, considering it was a casino on the Strip. 
There was no wait to be seated at 8 pm on a Saturday night. 
Options for turkey and veggie burgers, variety is always a plus. 

Dislikes: 
I had to ask for water multiple times before I got it. My husband also asked for waters for the table. I was the only one that got a water, after asking again...  And I REALLY needed some water!!!
When my husband asked for his burger to be medium well he was told his options were medium or well, nothing else. 
Most of the beers that our table requested were not available. Having a decent selection of good beers means nothing if the ones people order are not actually available. 

The garlic and herb fries smelled fantastic but I found the flavor to be a little weak. Maybe it was the booze messing with my tastebuds though?? They don't skimp on the amount of fries, consider splitting an order if you aren't a heavy eater. My brother in law RAVED about his burger, he even said it was the best he ever ate. That may have been the whiskey talking though...  My husband devoured his burger as well, and commented that he could really tell the meat was good quality. 

Since the guys were so happy with their meals, I would definitely be down to go back sometime... When I am a little less lubrucated of course!I had a chile relleno burrito and an iced tea.  The burrito cost about $6.99 and was also filled with beans, rice, and other goodies.  It was very tasty, large, and I couldn't finish it.  The second diner ate taquitos.  The plate came with guacamole and sour cream, as well as beans and rice.  She stated that the taquitos were a "4" on a 1-5 scale, but the avocado in the guacamole was not ripe.  I believe that the tea was about $2.00, and it was about 32 ounces and delicious.  The second diner did not like the beans, which I tried, and they were not served hot.  The taquito dinner was also $6.99.  The portion size was generous, and the second diner could not finish her meal.  Overall, La Cosina Mexican Restaurant was more of a 3.5 than a 3 star restaurant.  I do believe that this is the only Mexican restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd between Mandalay Bay and South Point.I love the serendipity 3 in New York. It's got great ambiance, makes you feel like a little kid again looking wide-eyed around you at all the treasure (chocolate) and magic (chocolate) you can find. 

This one...is not quite the same. They have a to-go order place outside which can be pretty useful, and an indoor/patio seating area. It definitely didn't have the fantasy-landish, childlike daydream, alice-in-wonderland feel of the other one. It felt more like a glorified Mcdonalds. But hey, its' Vegas right, maybe feeling like a lil kid here would be too much. 

We ordered

ABC burger - Avocado, brie, caramalized onions. Sounded delicious but it wasn't. I love burgers too :( I would rather have had In n Out. And for 3 bucks instead of TWELVE. 

Chicken pot pie - NO. nonononono. Two ppl ordered it and neither finished more than a few bites. 

Hangover omelet - this was one of the better dishes, an omelete with bacon and egg and french fries. But even this was only okay, which sucks because bacon and french fries is almost like cheating! Overall it was just really ...eggy. 

Corned Beef Reuben - Pretty damn good. Thick slices of corned beef. But this isn't supposed to be a jewish deli. Still a good sandwich though.

Frozen Hot Chocolate - Just as good as NY. It was amazing. 

Come here for dessert. don't eat here for lunch/dinner unless you want to shell out 12 + bucks for mediocre food. Bring your date here though and watch as the freaking Godzilla-sized sundaes are brought out!why have i not yelped on serendipity yet?! the very first serendipity i went to was the one in NY, and we all know that it is delicious!! so in vegas we wanted to try the new one that came out. When we got there, we called to ask for reservations for that day bc if its anything like the one in NYC, then theres gonna be a long line. Luckily we went there early in the day when they opened so they werent that busy and were able to squeeze us into a table. The place is pretty small. They have outdoor seating available as well. We had their food there. Wasnt the greatest thing in the world. It was actually just mediocre. Nothing too fancy or special, plain american food. But we all know what everyone goes there for is their frrrrrrrozen hot chocolate and boy is it yummy!!! it is definitely the highlight and the standard of serendipity. just like in NYC (without the movie feel haha)! so it is a definite must! it is huuuge so share one with a friend. actually with a couple bc its that big!

The place itself is very cute, from the boobie hostess desk to the cute souveniers and shirts they sell. way overpriced of coursem but hey what can you expect?! its only in vegas!!! hahaThis one is tough - 4 stars for the frozen hot chocolate (I got the mint, others got the white & original), and 2 stars for the food... But I suppose that's really the focus of the place... Had the A, B, C burger (avocado, brie & caramelized onions) which was ok but not incredible. The crabcake sandwich that my friend had was pretty good though... 30 minute on what appeared to be a restaurant with plenty of open seating, which was somewhat frustrating, but that's Vegas... Overall would come back for the frozen HC, but probably would skip the meal.i may not be a huge dessert lover or burger joint junky...

But you have to try (at least a hundred times) Serendipity's frozen ice-cream shake, esp the strawberry. OOOOOh, your tongue will thank you!

would have been a 3.5 stars but the hour wait...you serious? Host aren't that friendly either...perhaps the 105 degree weather...perhaps!Desserts are the star here! If you come solely for a frozen hot chocolate or yummy treat, you'll have a 5 star time all the way!

HOWEVER, if you come here for dinner, don't expect anything different than you could get at your local diner. And for triple the price. 

Waitstaff seem hurried and frazzled. Hostesses are drone-like. Very mediocre service.

That being said, I will ALWAYS be back for the signature frosty indulgences...no matter how blah everything else may be!Came here for the first time to try the frozen hot chocolate with the guys. thought it was just a random bar from the outside. waited about 15 minutes so we chilled out in the patio out front and people watched. Text us when our table was ready. Server was very cheeful and pleasant. Took our order, 3 frozen hot chocolates, order of onion ring tower, tacos and sliders. Food came pretty quick, Tacos and sliders were okay, enjoyed the onion rings. Looked for our server and couldn't find him for awhile, our water glasses were needing a refill. overall good experience.We came just to get an Asian fruit cake for my daughter's birthday.  For an 8" cake, it was $25.  That seems steep to me.

Dealing with Asian Asians, they are sometimes rude and not courteous.  We got the typical Asian rudeness here.  The place was crowded with similar rude Asians and the parking lot was crowded with rude Asian drivers and people smoking outside the store.

Well, we got what we came for, the cake.  Just didn't feel like seeing what else the store had.Great service, friendly, and nice ambience. Loved the Appetizer plate with cheese and crackers and fruit. Very tasty. Terrible wine unless you enjoy kook-aid on your me was porch. Hey..I am not a wine snob but eh.I believe in second chances but I'm still wary of eating their meat. So I stuck to my favorite: vegetarian tacos. The beans aren't mushy, the fajitas veggies have crunch and flavor, and they're cheap. My lunch was under $3 (one taco and a water cup). I'm not big on heavy lunches so this was a quick bite and it satisfied me until evening.Clean, modern, Roomy Spots-bar atmosphere.  They offer a Tepan grill or a regular Sushi bar.  Chicken can be dry depending on the Sue-Chief so I always go with the Steak & Shrimp at the Tepan grill.   For those of you who are timid when it comes to Sushi try the Lobster Tempura Roll to dissolve any reservations you ever had (its cooked).  Fun place to take out a group of people.Good hands on experience - pick your food then dunk it in a boiling cauldron of stock to cook. Not overly expensive and if you pick a busy time you get a free sauna into the bargain.I know this place isn't authentic, but the Orange Chicken is pretty darn good. Also, the staff here is friendly and the location is clean. I don't love the prices, but it's fast and convenient. They also have this Peach Green Tea that is freakin' tasty. I think I refilled my cup like 3 times.I've been here for lunch twice and Oliveo lives up to its expectations as an inexpensive fast food style pita restaurant that caters to the college crowd.  I've had a greek salad with gyros that was generally flavorful, but just of average quality across the board.  On my second visit, I ordered the portobello mushroom pita with a greek side salad.  The girl behind the counter let me stand there for almost ten minutes while she took a phone order from someone who could not figure out what they wanted and then when she finally did take my order was rude and seemed put out to have to do so, typical of restaurants of this caliber located in the ASU area.   My food arrived on two separate plates which at first seemed puzzling.  After the first bite of my pita, I realized why.  The portobello mushroom was of average quality and had decent flavor as did the pesto that was included, and the wheat pita itself was fresh and of good quality.  What I wasn't expecting, though, was the absolute geyser of liquid that shot out the end of the pita that I bit into and sprayed all over my face.  Similarly, the other end of the pita (the whole thing was wrapped in foil) was gushing liquid as if someone had managed to hide a garden hose somewhere in my pita and had stealthily turned it on as a joke.  By the time I was done eating, I'd gone through an entire stack of napkins and my plate was filled to the point of nearly overflowing with liquid. I could barely manage to carry it to the bus tub where customers are supposed to place their dirty dishes without it dripping onto the floor.  I still can't explain what all that juice was.  I love portobellos and make portobello burgers at home all the time and have never experienced anything remotely like that.  Be forewarned, if you're planning to try that item, I would suggest slipping on your rain poncho first.Lets get past the people at the host desk trying to look like club promoters, past the45 minutes it took to get a drink at the bar while the table was getting "prepped" which I don't get they were not even doing anything to anything. I was staring at an empty table for 15 minutes..guess whose it was. excellent.. Ok, let's also not mention the slow as hell waiter...um...let's see...what is there to mention then?? I guess the scallops where ok, not the best esp for the price. The mashed potatoes where ok but really again, not for the price.I do think it is what I get for ordering shellfish at a steakhouse but still, if you are going to do it you should at least do it right. I would not pay to go there again, but I would give it another shotSo, first off, I'm biased because AJ's was my favorite Vegas steakhouse for years. I ate here one time before but it was right at opening so I reserved judgment.

Got a comp for 2 last week after a marathon gambling session. Both got the ribeye, an app (salad, kobe meatballs), and two sides (asparagus, cream spinich). 

Best thing I can say about the above... good not great. It certainly has a hip vibe fitting with the rest of Hard Rock so I'd reccomend it if you're already staying at Hard Rock and either have an expense account, a comp, or just craving a high end steak and don't want to leave the property. 

There's really not much reason otherwise.I was really pleased with our most recent trip to iHop. The service was a little lackluster in that the server was having a particularly loud conversation with another guest. 

Red Velvet Pancakes were really good and left me wanting more. I seriously considered ordering more, but didn't want my company to wait around on me just so I could hog on more cakes.The Friday after Thanksgiving we needed to have something other than Turkey. Mexican sounded awesome. The reviews for Gallo Blanco sounded equally awesome.  So, we jumped in the car and made the 20 minute drive from Glendale. 

The menu looked as good as described on Yelp. It was 10:20 and we had each picked an appetizer and a main course.  This was going to be an expensive breakfast/lunch.

The waitress came over to ask if we knew what we wanted to order.  She acted like we were inconveniencing her. The restaurant only had 3 or 4 tables so I wrote the attitude off to the fact she was having to work the day after Thanksgiving. 

We began by ordering two of the Yelper's recommended appetizers. The waitress immediately scowled and said they were only serving breakfast (which consisted of less than ten items and none of the highly rated appetizers). Since this completely screwed up our order, we asked for some more time. She said, "Why don't I get your drink order.". We ordered two teas. (Except for the fact it said "Breakfast served all day" on the menu, there was nothing to indicate when any of the other items on the menu would be available.)

She came back and told us we could only choose from the breakfast items. They did not serve anything else for forty more minutes. 

A little customer service would have been nice. How about, "We are really sorry but we are a small restaurant and haven't finished the preparation of the other items. If you want to order (enter suggestion here) I will put in your order for lunch as soon as possible"

Really, try a little. Act like you care. 

After briefly contemplating just walking out my wife and I ordered from the limited breakfast menu.  

She ordered the Chile Quiles and I ordered the Chorizo and Eggs.  

While we waited and enjoyed the excellent tea, we were bothered by flies.  Fortunately, the table next to us received their food order and the flies went over to their table.  

Despite the rocky start, the food arrived and it was very good. In fact, it was excellent.  The hot sauce and green sauce were fantastic. 

I can only give three stars because of the total lack of customer service during the initial and, in my mind, crucial ordering stage.    Also, the flies were kind of gross.  

The food was four stars.  I will try this place again.  But only after 11:00 a.m.I'm not quite understanding these 5 star reviews....maybe they are friends with the manager or owner. 

It's not that I think this is a poor experience. I agree with most of the comments: "unpretentious" "comfortable" "great ambiance". My visit was all those things --  pleasantly surprising a restaurant found in a hotel. 

The menu is interesting and even innovative; not many nuevo-Mexican establishments serve Chilaquiles on the menu. The mini tacos were good, with a veggie option, Carne Asada or Cochinita Pibill. The carne asada was grizzly (and remember, this is a mini taco - so to have all three bites to be grizzly was a disappointment. ) Conversely, the Cochinta was flavorful (but it was a little greasy))-- but man -it was delish! 

I ordered a side of Guacamole - yuck. But I also ordered a side of French Fries (don't ask what spurred that combination), which I LOVED. 5 Stars for the French Fries which came along with an Aoili Chili dipping sauce. 

The Gallo Blanco Cafe deserves your attention and hopefully they'll just continue to tweak the food a bit because the place has potential. 

(NOTE: I went for lunch, so I'm not sure what the bar atmosphere or happy hour/dinner is like.)So we hit up Toby Keith's bar after dinner for a bachelorette party. My friend loves country so we thought this would be really appropriate. We walk in and it's Saturday night around 10:30pm and it was a little on the empty side which was a little surprising but obviously who cares, we came here to party! We go up to the bar and stand there for 15 mins before a bartender asks us if we want anything. Several bartenders were walking around not doing anything which got me a little irritated as well as my friends. We finally get our drinks which were pretty good at least. I'm not a big country fan but if you love country or want something different you should try this place. Definitely not my scene.They have unique pastries...a lot of the stuff they sell are something you don't see at other places.  My friend and I ordered the pistachio cheesecake, chocolate whoopie pie, rum ball and danish with whipped creme and custard (the day's special).  

Everything was good but  I had an over-expectation seeing yelp and they did not amaze me at all.   Everything is reasonably priced and the employees are friendly.No negative feedback. Just my local CVS.Had a pretty good dinner here the other night.  Wish they had a couple of different salsas,  the one they have is really hot and I like hot, but it was to hot, It would also be nice if they gave you a small bowl for salsa when you order and pay for the chips and salsa,  the tiny one ounce to go container is kinda hard to eat chips and salsa out of.  The chips were homemade and tasty.  The beans were really good and the fresh flour tortillas are awesome.  pretty disappointed in the enchilada,  the tortilla was really tuff and I wish I had a knife to cut through it,  also the sauce was not  very good.  This is a quick easy place to grab decent fast Mexican food.  Will be back for a bean and cheese burrito for sureGreat homemade tortillas but meat was bland. Needed to use outside sauces and salsa to flavor, but maybe that's deliberate. Floor needed to be swept a little but appeared very clean otherwise. Very casual/simple dining, almost like fast food. Not a sit-down and be served by a waiter place; you stand in line and your food is handed to you on a plastic tray. Other reviews I've read seemed to have been expecting a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's just not what this place is. It's very laid back but the food is real good.I stayed at this location for one night during my spring training trip. I arrived at 4pm, my room was ready, it was clean and nice. Bed was very comfortable and room was very quiet. I did get a very good nights rest. There is however not a whole lot of places to eat or ammenities close to this location so if you want to go out and sample some night life you had better have a car. Also, pool is kind of small and not very fancy. Other than that, the stay was good.Did they change the restrooms???  WHY?!!!

I don't know if I can visit after hearing that.  Those things were art.  ART.

Alas, I'm sure some day I'll wander down and check out the food.  Photos make it look delicious and interesting... so glad to to see we're keeping the restaurant biz rolling downtown.meh - it may look cool and even seem cool but it's mostly just surface treatments with the illusion of high glamour. 

quite the empty mall.  

another reviewer mentioned not enough "positive chi for shopping" - it's true. this environment smacks of trying too hard. yes there are ultra chic shops, plus casual dining etc. but it's not quite enough of an experience to be in the space itself. 

its hallways felt barren even with its luxury - kind of like a high fashion model that just can't smile because she takes the idea that she's just a clothes hanger waaaaay too seriously.

just doesn't stir the senses enough to actually shop.Cartwright's is American Cuisine fused with Southwest ingredients. You have to give them credit for preparing everything in-house daily that means sauces,  breads and desserts. They proudly let you know they only use all natural steaks and mesquite grill them. They even employee a rising star pastry chef that prepares the desserts for Cartwright's and the sister restaurant Tonto.

They started us off with a nice fresh baked bread sampler and some really ice cold better that cracked the bread when you tried to spread butter on it. I started out with a bloody mary and I was impressed that they rimmed it with celery salt ( a nice touch ) but then after the vodka only added Mrs. T's Mix to it. Maybe this drink is out of style I don't really know but I thought a nice flavorful bloody mary with horseradish , maybe a dap of hot sauce and worcestershire would go really well with steaks in this old fashioned looking kind of place. Switched to wine it was fine.

Our server made the special salad of the evening sound really good and her story of the chef going out and picking the flowers from ocotillos impressed us so we split one of those salads to try. They did present us with two beautifully prepared salads. That were pristine fresh and had all the fruit and vegetables hand cut fresh to order. For me this might have been the high light of the meal. 

The rest was good for it's price point and I'd go back!

3.5 StarsHad a Living Social coupon for Arcadia Tavern and anxious to try it out. The place was packed - of course it was a Friday after work so this was to be expected. After about 20 minutes, we were seated and the waitress came by and asked if we wanted our drinks refreshed (well, yes!!) Both the wine and the whiskey were generous pours [smile]. What we didn't realize was that Arcadia Tavern is basically a sports bar kicked up a notch or two. Not that that's bad - just was a surprise.

The food isn't your basic sports bar food either. That too, has been kicked up a couple of notches - no jalapeno poppers or potato skins on the menu!!! Yea! I asked the waitress what type of bread/roll the chicken caprese sandwich came on and was told it was an "artisian" roll. Guess my interpretation of that is different as it seemed like a plain white hamburger bun to me. In any event, the sandwich was good and the chicken was moist. The Phoenix Philly was very good - great flavor and just the right amount of heat. The waitress was pretty much MIA - brought our food - sped by once, and then again to drop off the bill. 

The place was LOUD - crazy LOUD! Our table was right by the door and it was obvious that a number of the people coming in knew some of the other patrons - obviously a lot of regulars. 

There is an outside seating area - in nice weather it might be nice, but we noticed there was a city bus stop right out front - not so sure I'd want to side outside with all the car fumes and city bus fumes, too.

Good food, decent prices, generous pours on the drinks, LOUD atmosphere (did I mention that already??), energetic vibe. I think we'll try it again - and when you check in on Yelp - you get a coupon for $5 off your bill!!!I like Jacobs, but I can't give it anymore than 3 stars.

Cakes, considering the raw ingredients that it takes to make them, end up costing penny's. I remember I throwing together a whole traybake for less than £1 (and sold 12 slices at 1.95 each).

Even though they look pretty like Amy says, 3 bits of cake were nearly £5. That's a hell of a profit they are making off each cake, which probably cost them 20p to produce each. I don't want them to sell it to me at cost, but at least take 50p off each cake. Then they would be able to compete with greggs at lunchtime.

Tastey if you can afford it.I got the carrot/cream cheese frosting cupcake and loved it. I am a sucker for cream cheese frosting, though. The latte was good, and it was all under $5.

The furnishings are very cute.Yummy!  Had the funghi pizza and it was delicious.  Lower stars because husband hated,I mean really hated his lamb sandwich.  Whinged all the way home about having to brush and floss his teeth to get the horrible taste out of his mouth.I had high expectations for the Parlor, and I've been told to go here for the two years I've lived in Phoenix, but the stars didn't align until tonight, when my wife and I were able to sneak away for their happy hour.  

First, the decor is comfortable and modern, just like any number of restaurants in Phoenix--think Postino's, the Vig, Windsor, etc.  We asked to be seated in the courtyard, as the weather was close to perfect.  Hostess was friendly. So far, so good.  

A waiter arrived at the table that was seated a couple minutes after us and he enthusiastically told them about a fresh salad that had just been picked from the owner's garden, and it piqued our interest.  Our waiter arrived a couple minutes later and offered drinks, but nothing about specials.  I would describe our waiter as cautiously friendly.  I waited tables in college, and I remember waiters seeing certain patrons come in and wanting to shuffle them off of someone else...I felt like that patron.  I had a nearly identical experience at FEZ a couple years back, and I've only returned once.  There are too many restaurants in Phoenix to bother with mediocre service.  

So service was a little chilly.  How was the food and drink?

The freshly-picked salad was excellent.  Bitter greens with fresh-made croutons and a beet vinaigrette with beets picked out of the same garden.  Simple, fresh, wonderful.  

Ordered two of the happy-hour pizzas: the Margherita pizza and a pesto pizza.  They were both decent, with the pesto being a bit better, but neither were spectacular.  I still prefer Pizzeria Bianco for this kind of pie, and no one in town, maybe even the state, can match Pino's Margherita.  It just felt average.  I've also eaten a lot of pesto on trips through Liguria, so I know what I want.  

Had the cherry zeppole for dessert.  Good, but not inspired, and probably wouldn't spend the money again.  Tiramisu is probably a safer choice.

I really wanted it to be better, but we were turned off by the service, and the food wasn't spectacular enough to overcome that obstacle.  Plus, I can go across the street and have better pizza with Bianco, and no parking headaches.I enjoyed the pizza. The bar area is a great place to meet new people because the seating necessitates sharing tables.Made the mistake of going there 2 days before Christmas... There was a lot of staff which is good! But there was just too many people inside...Good sandwiches and salad bar, a tad pricey for items.My friend and I were about an hour late, but we were accommodated. The whole staff was friendly. We started with two flutes of champagne and a seafood platter that had oysters, clams, lobster, shrimp, and the biggest crab leg I've honestly ever seen. The three sauces that accompanied the seafood platter were all divine. We were served different types of breads with butter, a soft mini pretzel roll, spicy, large fancy cracker, and a chewy raisin type. I just couldn't get enough of these! The different textures were a delight. Then came the expensive bottle of  Riesling which i practically finished myself before the Entree was even ordered. I asked for the label. But, I guess they forgot. I regret this. It was the best Reisling I've ever had. I ordered the smallest portion of filet mignon and a side order of roasted bone marrow. I never would've thought that bone marrow would be that tasty. a woman stopped by the table and took some photos. It was then that I realized, I took too long noshing on bread and guzzling  sumptuous wine. I looked at that picture perfect, untouched filet mignon. I was full when it came time to dive into the magical creation that was the reason for coming. It ended up in a doggie bag. Shameful I know. I never got to try it. The pictures were nice. The prices I'm sure were way out of my economic league. I bet the bill would've been a car payment. But, thanks to my well-to-do friend, who $$$$splurged on me, I got to experience this epicurean adventure.
Would I return. Doubtful. But, splendid experience.This service was not up to level that you expect for this type of highly priced restaurant.  The food was inconsistent.  My entree was great- I had the scallops- but my dining partner had the waygu beef and it was just ok. For $50 it should be better than ok.  The ambiance is just ok, music a little loud, seating is uncomfortable. Wine list is also not that interesting.  All in all it was just an ok experience.  For the prices, it should be a fantastic experience.The service - 5 stars. The food - 2.  I love me some fatty red meat, but the short rib was over-the-top fatty. I couldn't eat half of it.  My friend's gnocchi was way too garlicky. The only thing that saved this meal was the service which, as stated at the start, was impeccable. Don't think I'll be returning, though.The food is adequate, the atmosphere acceptable, service competent. Should you want your basic B,L,D... it gets the job done.. albeit at some higher prices. You know going in... it's not fine dining.Okay I have decided to write a review on a buffet that is so-so.  Not sure if I am being fair with this as I generally do not enjoy buffets...any place that I have have to wait in line or watch people mull around with plates of food in their hands while they "sample and eat" at various food stations does not appeal to me.

Needless to say The Buffet at Aria has vastly improved from its original days.  Clean, open dining area seen from the hallway makes it feel spacious.  The individual food stations were small while the portions were also small...nice!  Better than a huge stainless steel tray and a spoon where you scoop up your portion size. I think this is better so that you will eat smaller portions and more variety.

It was nice to see a seafood station that is part of their regular menu...nit some special Only on Friday or the weekend.

If you like buffets and are with friends or family, I would suggest giving this one a shot however if you're looking to be impressed there are others that are far better than Aria....Coming from SGV and SF, I was a bit underwhelmed by this place.  Although it is decorated to be fancier, being in Vegas.  

Service: This is the better part, they were friendly and suggested wines or alcoholic drinks.  

Food:  Nothing that stands out too much, although we did do the restaurant week for Vegas, some portions seemed to be small but definitely nothing special.Clearly, I was inebriated beyond belief. This was right after a glorious adventure at XS. I had met a new delightful friend and we walked here, or better yet stumbled here. The usual Denny's. Nothing special. We ate.

Upon leaving, I hadn't realized it then but my phone accidently fell out of my pocket. Once I got back to my hotel room I noticed it was missing. Losing your phone in Vegas is pretty much losing touch with reality. In a fit of panic I called over and they were kind enough to hold onto it for me. 

Again, still inebriated. I thought it was just a hop, skip and jump from my hotel room so I decided to walk instead of taking a taxi. It's approximately 6am, crazy hot and I'm walking. As I continue to walk, I begin to realize that it is ALOT further than I thought. Urgh.... 

Finally got my phone back with a pleasant txt msg waiting for me. I can exhale.

Thanks to this Denny's for holding onto it! Saved my life.The service was VERY slow.  The potato chips were great.  

The food was OK but nothing memorable.

My wife had halibut which was overcooked.  I had a short rib pasta that was OK.

We DID love this eggplant dipping sauce and bread.  That was great!Cute little space in Scottsdale101, with nice staff. Red Mango may be the original tart yogurt place (as they claim), but they've been far outdone by newcomers. Their new tangomonium flavor and the pomegranate flavor are both good, but personally, I find their yogurt too creamy for tart flavors. I prefer the slightly more icy Pinkberry yogurt (Ice Tango, here in AZ, is more similar to Pinkberry). But the ultimate fro-yo place, IMO, is Yogurtland, and they spank Red Mango silly on variety and cost. For about $10 at Red Mango, you get two smalls with two toppings each. For roughly the same price at Yogurtland, you can get two huge cups with as many flavors and toppings as you'd like (it's done by weight). Red Mango may be the first but Yogurtland is the champ!Date/Time: Sunday - 12:30pm
Occasion: Hangover lunch
Party of:  Eight
Ordered: Pho tai bo vien & fresh squeezed OJ
Location: About 15 minutes from the strip; clean & spacious location 
Total incl gratuity: ~$10pp

The broth was really refreshing and so good especially after a night of drinking.  When we got there, there was probably only two other tables so we thought it'd be quick - in and out!  Unfortunately, we learned the hard way.  The service turned out to be extremely slow.... nice, but slow!  Whereas it normally takes about 30 minutes for me to order, receive, and eat a bowl of pho...this place took us about an hour and a half.  The woman who was our server was running around like a madwoman and took forever.  It took about 20 minutes just to get our water and beverages.  The chef appeared to be the same person delivering our food...which took about 30 minutes for us to get.

The food was good, vegetables were definitely fresh. however this place is not good enough for us to spend that much time waiting.  I think I'll stick with the pho restaurants closer to the strip in Chinatown next time.Good solid Panda Express.  It is in the Meadows Mall.  There is never too long of a line.  When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.  

When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place.Some of my friends say I live out in the middle of nowhere and there isn't anything of interest here. Well now we have a yogurt jungle! Self-serve frozen yogurt. Take that! (you know who you are...) Our dining options are actually very limited so when something new opens, we flock to it. I have driven past Yogurt Jungle for a couple of weeks and longed for the day I could try it. After a small salad at the neighboring Paradise Café, it was my shot. 

I entered the store and to be honest if smelled a little funny. Too clean maybe?  I couldn't quite place it - perhaps a hospital? Either way, that was just the first reaction but I got over it. I was impressed with the seating. Mod furniture chairs, tables and sofa made me want to come home and watch Austin Powers. I took a minute to look over everything - it was a little overwhelming with all of the options. I made my way to the back of the store and looked at the various options for frozen yogurt. Cool - they have the little ketchup cups from McDonalds to use as samples. Being my first time I had to try them all - it was research after all. The pistachio was very good (and ultimately that's the one I chose), there was New York cheesecake, pomegranate, blueberry, something called Euro Tart (which ignited me by name, but when I tasted it I was quickly turned off), peanut butter (which was good, but I didn't go with), chocolate (which was a little runny), Vanilla and Mango Tango (didn't try that one) and another one or two that I can't remember. The selection was good and most tasted really good. 

Next up was the sauces - white chocolate, milk chocolate, marshmallow, caramel and something else. There were toppings - anything from candy bars such as Twix, Heath and Reese's to cereals such as cookie crisp and coco puffs. There was banana chips, some assorted jellies (which looked and sounded nasty) and a lengthy list of others. I was guessing over 50 toppings (but reading an earlier review it says over 60 so I will go with that). It was impressive...but I have trouble making up my mind and I find too many choices hinders progress. Fortunately my friend & I were the only ones in the store. 

I went with the pistachio with white chocolate, milk chocolate, chocolate chip, health bar and a chocolate jimmy. She has New York cheesecake with cheese cake bits and I can't tell you what sauces she put on it. What I can say is I finished mine and when she was finished with hers it was offered up to me and that was the first time in the history of my existence I took a bite and passed. Get a pen and write it on the calendar. Fat boy couldn't eat the dessert because it was nasty. When you have too many options you can go crazy with things and try experiments that fail.  The price is 39 cents per ounce, which is good. Together for both of ours it was about $7. In addition to the cool furniture, they also have 2 lap tops set up with Wi-Fi, so that's a bonus.

The quality of the yogurt was good, the toppings seemed endless, but if I am being honest, it was just okay for me, dog. There is the opportunity to make some nasty concoctions and we did just that. While the experience wasn't bad, I think to myself would I go back and really be a regular? Probably not. If I happen to be there and I have a hankerin' for a yogurt...and the line isn't too long, I will stop in. But would I go out of my way and make a special trip to hit up the Yogurt Jungle? Not likely.Cheap and easy.

If you are looking for quick mex, Maria's is the place to go. I wouldn't say it's the best mexican food but it's good enough. I like the quesadilla which is pretty hard to mess up. :)This place Is a little heaven for pregnant woman. As soon as you step foot in the place it is as if you entered a small retreat celebrating babies and bellies. They offer many different massages that target pregnancy needs. I never retrieved any pampering services because they are very pricy. I went to massage envy had a prenatal masseuse for half the price. This is why I gave it 3 stars. Belly Bliss should be aware that the clients comb through the door are getting ready to stray families and cost should be something that is reachable. As I said Before I received 2 massages for the price of one at Belly Bliss. The boutique has much you look at with some great ideas of things to purchase. Chewable necklaces??? Awesome! I took there prenatal yoga classes and they are great. The room is small and comfortably can fit up ton 10 woman plus instructor. The only draw back is the class schedule. Yoga I only offered a few times a week and the majority are in the morning. For working moms this limits you to only Wednesdays in the evening (I think 5:30). The classes are a good price (5 for $30) or $8 per class. They also have post birth classes yoga with your baby. A way to meet moms in the area. Last I forgot to mention the snack bar! There is a free snack bar with yummy and healthy goodies. And yes it's free!Da lat was just that.  Simple and okay.  I would not send a postcard from this location raving about the pho.  I will try it again someday but for now I found an amazing Vietnamese restaurant.Two drink minimum!  Really?  

The pianists were okay, but didn't seem to mesh well together, sounded the same (as far as fingerwork on every song and voice), and kept messing up.  

The location by the pool is gorgeous and the servers were not super friendly or smiling, but were professional and prompt.

Requested "Lucille", a dueling piano classic, and they just kept apologizing that the Wynn/Encore prohibited them from doing the song the way they usually do, as they have a strict "no profanity" rule.  

Well, for an adult's late night bar, that's no fun.  :-(Nice layout. Plenty of TV's and almost any sport you can think of.

Service is just ok. I usually only go around lunch and happy hour so I don't know what the night time is like. The food is ok. Some items are better than others. The fish and chips can be really good at times and then not so much other times. The pizza was surprisingly good. I'm usually skeptical about pizza on the menu at an Irish bar but it was pretty good.I didn't come here for the food, but the apps I've had there are okay.  I've only come here because they have karaoke all the time and they have pool tables that I have yet to use.

Service could be better.  We often wait awhile between drinks.  But the servers are friendly.

The drinks are watered down.  Don't get anything with their sweet n sour mix.  Yuck!  Had to send those drinks back.  I've stuck to bottles ever since.  

Although the place is never packed, there always seems to be a long wait to sing.  The KJ sings in between customers which is a no no in the business if you have as many singers as this place does.  

The seating could use a little help as well.  It isn't very comfortable.  I think the only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because we know we can get our karaoke on and play some pool (someday).  It's not super pricey, but given the quality of their drinks, I would say they are overpriced.Great 80s music but drinks are overpriced (but what isn't) unless you are gambling; you can sit at the bar and put money in the video poker and get free drinks.just average. the precooked food as ok. most of it was room temp not hot. The server never offered to swap the grill. Overpriced for the food... better off going to tofu hutSura has a large selection of meats and other Korean dishes but since it's a buffet, none of the food was really memorable. It's quantity over quality here. Definitely think about coming here if you have a large group (we had about 20 people) but don't come expecting the best quality Korean BBQ. There are plenty of other options in the area.I've eaten here a couple of times with my kids.  My dining experience there was ok.

The food is typical.  I really like wings and pretty much order them everywhere I go.  I expected more from this place, since the word "wings" is in the name of the restaurant.  

I'd eat here again if someone invited me to meet them there... and if they paid.I was disappointed with the food this time. The spicy yellowtail roll was too spicy. They over did it with the siracha sauce and spicy mayo. I didn't eat much of it and none of the servers or sushi chefs noticed. The rice on the nigiri tasted not so good. It was hard and maybe undercooked. I also had a tuna specialty roll and though the portion was large but the rice was ehhh. The service wasn't bad except for not asking if the yellowtail roll was okay. Don't think I will go back though.My food was really good-- my only complaint was the rude waitress who was very angry when I asked if I could eat there, only because she had already boxed it up without asking me if it was to take away or eat in. Not a huge deal, but disheartening for a weary tourist tired from hours of walking!It was good, wasn't great.. Just average and no good gooey toppings like warm Chocolate or marshmallow creamFood was good, service good, other reviews are harsh, food nothing to write home about but it's an 'american' Mexican and it delivers what you'd expectThere is a sense in which this place was on a hiding to nothing, from the outset, as we'd had a simply excellent meal, the night before, at Cafe Fish, with the same group of people, visiting for the Six Nations rugby. It seemed unlikely that we could hit those heights, two nights in a row.

And so it proved. I had a disappointing spinach souffle, to start, then followed with the steak hache, which was good without being particularly memorable. Service was confused and confusing, with a lot of staff overlapping and the pace of delivery rather pedestrian.

It was a shame as I really like the venue. It's an excellent marriage of old and new, and the place has a lovely vibe. Their wine list is as impressive as you would expect.

It's priced as fine dining, but the quality on offer is nowhere near that.

Overall, we said: "Bistro du Vin certainly met our post-match needs very nicely, but it didn't quite hit the heights, for me. While the setting was lovely, and a jolly good time was had by all, I'm not sure the quality of the dishes was all that it could have been."sure this place has decent food,  but i have to say its crammed in there and to tell you the truth, i dont like to listen to other peoples conversation  much less smell their freaking perfume. the selection was small and the bill higher than expected. probably will not return. in my list of buffet's this ranks in at 5The combination of chicken and waffles has baffled me for years. I never quite understood what would inspire a chef to serve these two unlikely meals on the same plate, but couldn't ignore how much folks raved about it. Day 25 of my 30 day blogging challenge  called for a "first" of sorts and I figured I'd get out of the house and do something new. Despite seeming like a breakfast/dinner clusterfuck, I opened my mind as well as my stomach, and ventured to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.

It had been years since I went to the original Phoenix restaurant (the epitome of a hole in the wall) but I did remember the food being good. Since the company branched out to include a Scottsdale location I was thrilled to only travel 5 mins for food. The location is nice, though I agree it doesn't have quite the "charm" of the original location. It felt more like a little, sit down restaurant than a hot food spot.

I fought the urge to stick with what I know and get catfish... but ended up biting the bullet and ordering the #10 (Tre-Tre - $7) which consisted of 2 legs and 1 waffle, a side of fried okra ($3.50) and "red" kool-aid.The restaurant happened to be running low on legs so there was a bit of a wait but I came equipped with a magazine so it wasn't a big deal.

The Verdict? It wasn't a bad meal but I don't think I'd ever order this again. It didn't taste bad... not at all, but I guess it just felt like I was paying for something my mom could've made me lol. The only reason to pay for this meal is because you don't have access to cooking it yourself. The Okra was just okay. I like Church's okra better. My mom has made better chicken but I'd take their waffles. This meal reminded me of going to Sprinkles for cupcakes. It's more about the hype around the place  than the actual meal itself... or it could be because my mom is from the heart of Mississippi and knows how to put her foot in southern food. Ehh.. I'm glad to say that I tried something new so I can turn it down in the future based on personal experience and not a notion.

Sidenote: The credit card machine was glitching out when I was there so next time I'd just bring cash. The staff was VERY friendly and it was a pleasant experience... just felt like I paid for a meal I could've gotten from home.Wow - I am super sleepy! That is a frequent occurrence when I eat at a Filly B's. It must be the magical combination of tortilla, meat and grease or perhaps a secret ingredient that makes me feel this way - but within 20 minutes I am ready for a nap. It is a struggle when I go for lunch, but just write the day off if I get a breakfast burrito in the morning!

This location is new, replacing Moe's a few months ago. The store is clean and the staff friendly. The food arrives quickly. I think it is a good portion for the price. I get a number 2 (taco & burrito combo) and I have never been able to finish it. The chips and salsa are free (I go with the tomatillo) and drink refills are free.  The rating would be a little higher perhaps, if not for the 60 cent surcharge for using your debit card.

If you are having trouble sleeping, come get a burrito here - it isn't just me. I have taken live sample surveys of people I know and they all are sleepy after eating Filbertos. Sweet dreams!I decided to go with something semi light so I went with the club sandwich: Sourdough bread with bacon, turkey, avocado and some other stuff  It was pretty good the fries that came with my sandwich were just right.. soft but very crunchy . My meal was good but  it gets 3 stars  from me because they don't have a very good selection on the menu. It does have a nice little patio in front looking out towards the various gates so you'll never miss your flight unless you are inside the bar watching a game. it's a Cool place to sit while u wait for your flight. :)had to go in and try the pie..

giving it 3 stars, and not because it was bad or anything was wrong with it.  It was very good.  But if it was back in NYC it would just be another average pizza place.  I know that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but it isnt.  This place is legit, especially for out here.

really glad this place opened as I think the more legit east coast pizza places around here the better.  This is most like Joe's NY pizza in scottsdale and  It reminds me alot of slices of pie you get on the Jersey Shore.  Obviously made by the same people who have made pizza back home in years past.

Had the onion and tomato pie and I liked it.The service is quick, though very impersonal.

Their gyro is good, but the meat is a bit too oily/greasy for me. Their cucumber sauce is absolutely amazing, though. The pita is average.

Their side greek salad is... a joke. It comes with a sort of ranch dressing, which is pretty ridiculous.

My Big Fat Greek Express is also a bit pricier than the tastier and friendlier Pita Shack which is only a block away.

BOTTOM LINE: I only come here when Pita Shack is closed.In the death throes of Big Wong the place had really  fallen apart. I was glad to see that the new owner had revamped the place. Nice decor...TABLES OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS. These tables are not only something that you'd expect to find at the top of a beanstalk, but I think archeologists will have a big find in a few thousand years (sturdy). The walls have been tastefully painted. The ceiling has been restored to it's 1970's, stick your pencil into, glory.

Food: Hot. Great gobs of hotness. They give you a scale of hotness (I love thai people) of 1-5. I hesitantly ordered my Spicy Noodles at a level 4. My wife ordered her pad thai at a level two. My dish came out at a perfect heat for me. The noodles could have been a little less done. I couldn't taste the spice at all, but my wife still enjoyed it. 

All in all, I'll probably be back.I wished I had known the massage alone was $55.. the groupon deal was a waste of money for me and I was a little disappointed... The jade bed is impossible to relax in while 5 people walk around and talk around you. Then I sat in the infrared sauna while it heated up for 10 minutes (equivalent to just sitting in your car during March) because they forgot to turn it on.  So, a bit annoyed, I just went home early. 

The massage was terrific though, I would give her 5*'s if the other factors weren't involved.. I also wish I could remember her name :( 

I was tempted to ask for my extra $20 back, so I could go relax at the bar at Frasher's! AgghhDinky little pub on Hunter Square that's ideal for a quick drink heading home or just heading in to town, but not quite big enough to spend a stretch of time in without getting a little cramped.

Owned/sponsored by Belhaven, this pub is linked to the White Hart bar in the Grassmarket and the World's End bar on the Royal Mile. How The Advocate squares up to the rest of the Belhaven pubs I'm not too sure but taking it at face value it is a nifty little pub that had an impressive selection of whiskies for a small bar.

There isn't an awful lot of space in this bar making it feel quite closed in as you can be standing a couple of feet away from people eating dinner as you're drinking a beer and watching the football on the TV.

I never tried the food as I was only passing by but with what I seen it looked like general pub fare with things like burgers, sandwiches and steak pie (do you really need anything else in a pub?)

A few bottled craft beers were available from Belhaven at around £3.40 per bottle. Tucked away between the Cowgate, the Bridges and the Royal Mile, it's only understandable that they sold "The Advocate" beanie hats too. I have to admit that I was very tempted to get on.

Service was good, pub was nice and warm for it being a cold afternoon and the beer was cold. Definitely worth a visit if you're passing through.For Madison this place is excellent, for those of us that live in large cities it is not fabulous.

At least it is in the city and you don't have to drive to get to the place.  And the interiors are nice.  You would do great in Boston!

On the downside, for a gay bar, 70% of the patrons are straight gals from Lodi celebrating someone getting married.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.

Oh Madison.  It was great to visit, but I am thankful I don't actually live there.After a few more meals and a few more months, I'm downgrading Green Owl to three stars.  It's still a cool place, and a useful veggie alternative, but honestly, the food is just "meh."This place use to be a 5 star for us.  Then the main waitress left, and things started going downhill.  I think business started to slow, and then the owner started trying to save money in the most ridiculous ways.  We were "regulars" and had a discount card, but she stopped excepting it when we used coupons.  Then she stopped putting coupons in the local clipper mag.  Last time we went the waitress said she couldn't initial our frequent customer card (eat there so many times and get a free meal) when we used a coupon?!?!  We have one more coupon we purchased from one of those daily deals places, but when that's gone we won't be going back.  Not to mention that the service is horrible now :(. Very sad... We were there 3-4 times a week.Went on the tour last night and it was interesting. This not a scary tour it's more historical. Having lived in Vegas for years I learned some new things. The bus is small kind of like those party buses or the bus that picks up senior citizens. My boyfriend liked the size of the bus it was comfortable and had plenty of windows. The 2 1/2 hours flew by. The hotel was nice on the inside and they had free parking. I can't say I would of paid the full price but since I had a groupon it was cool.There lack of consistency bothers me... when everything is done correctly I love it but over half the time my foccacia is different. Either no meat in the end pieces, chewy chicken (sometimes tastes microwaved) or bad service. The appetizer should be served before the entree! 

When they're on they are one of my favorite spots but I now second guess going more often than not because I never know which Zipps is gonna show up.It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.

The location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.   

When I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.

This is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there. 

I know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to.This place is close by. And in Vegas when its HOT!!!! that's very important. Great selections.My trusty dining companion and I had dinner here a little while back, er maybe 2 months ago, so I'm a tad late on my review. But as I was eating an order of fettuccine alfredo for lunch it made me think back to the most delicious fettuccine alfredo I have ever had, which is from here, Tommy V's. 
You would think that after such a statement they would rank up on my 5 star reviews list but alas the rest of the experience was sub par. My boyfriend had the baby clams linguine and it was just OK, not a lot of flavor and just not exciting; we had the fried calamari for our appetizer and again OK, but nothing to write home about, very very plain. 
The wine selection was good and for just a wine drinker and by no means an expert i appreciated the server (sorry can't remember his name) listening to my likes and dislikes and then choosing the perfect wine for me, that was impressive. 
The restaurant itself is nice but it just doesn't seem to fit the food, it seems very western and I would expect to see a menu for rustic American food as opposed to the Italian fare they serve. Also I didn't feel completely welcome, when we walked in, both of our first times here, we were unsure if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated and we had that super uncomfortable stand in the doorway while other diners stare at you moment which seem to last much longer then necessary, a server even walked by and said nothing to us. 
So Great great fettuccine, but next time I think I may just get an order to-go.Im writing this one for the unhappy reviewer who stopped while on a road trip, just to clarify the La Bamba experience for any other Yelpers. La Bamba is a college town restaurant, famous for serving burritos to drunk college students when the drunk parade starts after the bars close.  La Bamba burritos as big as your head are well loved and well remembered by many Big 10 students.  

The Madison location used to be just off State Street, but moved out to the burbs some years ago.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cold and cafeteria style; get your food, eat and get on your way.  I would not go here for a sit down Mexican meal.  Most folks go for one thing - the burritos.

My personal fave is the mini combo con todo!  Including that famous hot sauce.  It's been sixteen years since I graduated college, but every time we drive by East Wash we have to jump off 94 to get a La Bamba.  You crave them, wolf them down, and then think, meh.  It's alright.  (Not as good as at 3:00 a.m. after many many cheap tap beers).  The tacos are good as well, and they do have pastor.

I even pack a cooler and haul some up to my old college roomie in Mnpls.

Hint:  they taste even better the next day, after refrigeration for a day, and they do freeze well.

So if you want to try this wonderful burrito as big as your head experience, have at it.  If you want a nice Mex-American meal with frozen margaritas, this is not your place.We were craving Korean food, last night and I figured we would give E-Jo a shot, since the wife was always wondering about it.

We walked in as they were serving a pretty good sized family, and were seated at what almost seemed like folding card tables. We ordered 2 hot corn teas and a water, we got 2 hot corn teas and a cold corn tea. We were given one menu for three people too, which was rather inconvenient. 

Upon looking over the lone menu, and the picture menu on the wall, we realized E-Jo is strictly a soup restaurant. Unfortunately, that doesn't work for my stomach, as I can eat plate after plate of "real food" and still be hungry, soup is just like an appetite kick starter for me. My wife and her sister weren't really feeling the soup either, so we asked the server what we owed for the drinks, as we were looking for more than soup. She was very friendly and tried to sell us the kal bi and bulgogi soups, when we said thank you, but we are going to try somewhere else, she wouldn't accept payment for the drinks and wished us a good night.Service was TERRIBLE. Two ladies that helped us looked like they were having the worst day ever. But the food is good. We had my six year old niece with us and she asked for crayons and they were so rude to her! Not going back.I truly wanted to love this place. It's clean, family oriented, obviously adult friendly (beverages), and had the most amazing jukebox I have ever seen (although not working at that time.) Too bad the food
 was a let down, the knot were good but tasted like they were microwaved, the pizza was good if you like a sweet crust (I prefer sourdough), the pasta was okay but the sauce was a let down, and the worst was the tiramisu (a store bought tasteless mess). I would have loved to make this my regular place if it were just a bit better.Ordered the hottest wings and they were not very hot.  OK food at best.  Service was good.Food & service was good. I had ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. I had mild sauce, provolone cheese & the potato salad was good. Over our waitress was excellent. She was very polite & attentive.Menu has a lot of items. Cider on tap! Food left a little to be desired. Steak sandwich was a hunk of steak (not sliced on a roll).My first experience here was very much a 1-star. If I could have given it negative stars, I would have. Sticky drink glasses, the stuff in our curry looked old, the meat had a bad texture, the soup tasted like soap, and the shrimp smelled rotten. We had to send a dish back. We wanted to send them ALL back, but we paid anyways.

But then we went again. We got smoothies, stir fries, and some of the crunchy fried stuff, no meat and no soup. Oh SO much better!!! I wanted to order dozens and dozens of wontons. Mmmmm... This place is excellent, but there is too much menu choice (I can't help but think of kitchen nightmares lol, too much menu choice = disgusting food... this was the case here!!). I think they should cut their menu down and remove some unpopular dishes. Their menu feels like a novel, and half of the stuff doesn't even taste fresh.I hesitate to give The Griddle 3 and not 4 stars. I wish 3.5 was an option. 

The staff was helpful, the Orange Juice tasted like it had been juiced on the spot, and they had no problem making my order custom (I basically invented a sandwich and they didn't bat an eyelash).

Prices are decent. The place is sortof cute. Something is missing or else this would get 4 stars. It doesn't quite feel... cozy. Maybe because the doors are open and it was freezing, or maybe because the layout is awkward. I'm not sure. But it has potential. Worth a shot.Nothing extraordinary about this place, but I digged it.  I ordered their nachos, which was good for the most part.  Ordered a couple of Mimosas too, but I would skip on them.  They came in small plastic cups and were expensive and I didn't even taste the alcohol!  However, I would definitely recommend sitting outside.  The umbrellas actually work here and they provide a good amount of shade.  And it's perfect for random people watching!  In a non-creepy way.It is pretty decent for fast food BBQ. The ribs are not excellent but they are decent. I really like the Mac and cheese here a lot and I buy the cornbread to go when I get a chance. They have a lot of sauces so it is fun to experiment. Jut stay away from the riblet appetizer. I have no clue what those are but they are nasty.When the price of your burger combo exceeds $10 you start treading into Vig, Delux, Farm House Grill, Indulge Burger territory.  And when you draw that comparison the Five Guys is out of its league.  The burger is good but is it better then In-N-Out, Lucky Boy, Culvers, or Two Hippies? All of those options would be almost half as expensive as Five Guys.

Sorry, I liked you better when you were an East Coast treat.My old man is OBSESSED with Chinese food.  This can be a problem when he wants it for every meal, and I only crave it about once every couple of months.  Since I dragged him along to Vegas for a soccer tournament I was playing in, and he would be forced to pretend to enjoy watching me play in the sweltering heat for several hours each day, I decided to oblige his love of Chinese food and get dinner in Chinatown.

He chose Wendy's Noodle Cafe, based on the great Yelp reviews.  They had a couple of vegetarian options, but not tons.  Your usual options were there - veggie spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, vegetable chow mein.

We ordered the veggie spring rolls, vegetable chow mein, and my old man got something that was seafood and noodles - it might have been called seafood and noodles.  The seafood included squid, fish, and shrimp.

I thought the spring rolls were particularly good - it is difficult to make an outstanding spring roll, they are generally all good, but few are great.  These were great.

The vegetable chow mein was not as good.  I didn't like the sauce, I felt it had too much corn starch or something...couldn't really put my finger on it, but there was something about the sauce I wasn't into.  Also, the noodles were very thin, and I like thicker noodles.  Not a major failure, just not my cup of tea.

My old man loved the seafood noodles thing.  He said the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and he even had an entire conversation with our server about how well-cooked and fresh the squid was.  She said they get it fresh each day, it comes whole, and they prepare and cut it there.

I would definitely like to try Wendy's again, but I would not order the vegetable chow mein.  Although they don't have a ton of vegetarian options, I'm sure they would change up a recipe for me if I asked - the staff seemed very friendly and accommodating.  

Oh, and their iced tea is excellent.So if you need to catch a game but want some food as well, this is the place to go. Other than the TV's everywhere showing every game currently playing there is really nothing special about this spot.
Our waitress did an okay job. The drinks were a bit weak and pricey. I had the Steak sandwich with French fries. I have to say it was pretty decent for a sports bar.
I wouldn't go back, it's not really my thing, but you may like it!Fun restaurant! Fun menu! Too much of a loud, crowded, college-age scene on the weekends for my taste.I dig this spot.... smoothies are refreshing on a hot day. I love all of the smoothies. I have not had a chance to sample the food, but the next time I stop by, I will check it out. The decor is cool af. I like the shabby chic feel to it. I love to support local businesses,  so I will be back.Wonderful comfortable atmosphere   Wonderful selections of beer and wine   Love it!!!  However I will not go there again as the bathrooms ARE NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE!!!!!I've noticed inconsistent reviews here. People are either really happy or really ticked off. I live on the other side of the universe from this shop, and I have a "regular" shop near me which I visit 2x a month. However, this is the only shop I have found to do "creative" designs (like a plaid pedicure at Christmas).  
I have been here 6 times and have been very pleased.  The shop is in a bad area, so I don't know what people expect. Also, when English is not a first language and the shop employees are not from this country.....you sometimes have to make allowances for culture.  Yes - I have left nail salons because of a lack of friendliness, cleanliness.....and yes, I wish those who open businesses in our neighborhoods would prioritize learning how to do business according to the client's expectations ......and not their own. There ARE nail salons where they have learned to do this: speak English, be friendly, run an organized shop, be professional. This shop has a lot to learn, but I've never received a "bad" pedicure.The food was gr8. I'd give it 5 stars if only I had seen the server more often. The venue has a beautiful view n layout. I had no reservation n I got sat down immediately. Besides the sticky menu, the food came out promptly n was delicious. 

What really bothers me is that,  I wish we could tip the busser NOT the server. The bus boy gave us gr8 service, more attention n packed our leftovers. That's my only gripe. 

Please tip the busser cash. I'm a regular n I feel for themIt was okayAs a massage chain goes (which doesn't really even make sense because every massage therapist's touch is different, so you can't exactly guarantee the same service no matter where you go), I've always had a good massage therapist.

The membership deal is an interesting idea, not something you can get anywhere else in town.

My only beef is that the massage rooms are too small. My massage therapist was banging into the wall while moving around the massage table. It was a little on the claustrophobic side.I split a burrito bowl with the S.O.  We get the brown rice, black beans, double chicken, fajita veggies, several salsas, and guac.  It was more than enough for both of us, and for fast food, it doesn't get much more healthy than that.  This specific location would benefit from more umbrellas outside: there are plenty of tables and ONE umbrella. It's not brain surgery, folks.Well I have been going to Mellow since it has opened. My Yelp account says I have 50 check ins, but in reality I have more than 75 check ins. So I do love this place. The food is awesome, beer is always changing, and happy hour prices can't be best. So why lowering my review from a 5 star to a 3 star...the service...

Since coming to Mellow from the beginning I've been sitting at the bar. I enjoy watching people and interacting with the bar staff. Mellow had some awesome bartenders in the past, and a few current ones like Maralena, but some of the others just don't seem to care. Or worst yet..because we only come once every few weeks now if days (too much Mellow not good for the diet!) they seem to give preference to their new regulars from the nearby restaurants. I really don't mind that much, but don't make me wave you down or ask you for a drink! If you want to ignore me for most part, I'm ok with that. But don't clean glasses right by me and don't even look up to see if I'm wanting another drink or not?  That's my biggest pet peeve. On our last visit the other day it took us forever to put a order in even though it wasn't that busy. I can understand when just 2 bartenders have the bar, bar seating, and patio on a busy night. Maybe Mellow needs to have more staff on those nights. 

Anyways I've had some really great memories of mellow. I was coming 2-3 times a week on average and was a strong regular. We've been slowing down on going to mellow mainly of the service. Easy fix is just to ask if we want anything else, don't make me ask you as the bartender. Once or twice I can understand, now it's becoming a habit. Hope the manager reads these because I'd like to share my frustration in greater detail.The valley could use more locally owned places such as this, a relaxing joint to have a bite and no need to feel like in a rush.  I definitely give credit to our table runner... just as I asked where the knife and fork was, he immediately said he'd get it and other staff were unobstrusive about removing our plates later.  Since it's not restaurant style and leave a tip on the table, I think the higher prices are justifiable for their great service and pay their salary. 

As for the food, it's ok.. nothing mindblowing.. the bread (MJ's?!) under the croque monsieur was excellent but the rest was meh.. ended up scraping off the bechamel and eating the bread alone.  Tunia fish is fresh and tasty, generous helping.  It's really the combo of the  atmosphere and friendly vibe that would have me come back if I'm in the Ahwahtukee area.I liked this place.  We went for breakfast and I had an egg and sausage dish on a roll.  Really didn't like the roll at all, but what was inside was great (didn't need all that bread anyways).  We sat outside and I really want to go back at night with the fireplace going and listen to some music.  I'll be back.I know I only gave this spot 3 stars, but here's why. I come here almost every Sunday after hiking south mountain. It has fantastic lattes, way better than Starbucks, and the food is delicious too. However, the prices here are way too high for the amount of food/drink you get, and the service can occasionally be slow, depending on how busy it is. They do not handle busy times well, although they are much better than they used to be. The most disappointing thing about this place is that they no longer allow dogs in their nice side patio, so after my hike with my dog, I have to sit near the front door which downgrades my experience a bit. I still go here frequently despite all of the above as it really is a decent place for breakfast. Btw the mimosas are to die for!came here last summer and i was so excited to visit!! this place reminded me of sweet factory in sf (but they closed it down couple years ago). when i got here i was a bit disappointed because they did not have a big selection of sweets. but i did like how they had those candy jars and boxes to put your candies in. it was a bit overpriced but hey! i'm on vacation. it'll be souvenirs and i can reuse it at home anytime i want to. haha.Right at the intersection of N. Scottsdale Rd., N. Greenway-Hayden Loop and Mt. Getoveryourself Lane is the new shopping center, Scottsdale Quarters.  Because there was not enough shopping at Kierland Commons and certainly not enough within the surrounding square mile, Scottsdale Quarters was wisely erected during this recession.

I visited because my daughters received H & M gift cards for Christmas and there is an H & M here.  H & M is pretty much targeted at 20 somethings and wannabe 20 somethings.  Sort of Ikea meets The Gap.  Although in fairness I did spot a Sgt. Pepper looking jacket that I tried on...it just didn't work.  For me or anyone.

So Scottsdale Quarters also has some upscale stores and Brio restaurant which I have not tried but it has reviewed pretty well.  What they are lacking at this point is a good coffee house where dad's can chill while the kids are at H & M.

I like the upward rather than outward design of much of the shopping center.  It would be nice if they add apartments or condos rather than office space above,  Or at least a mix.  That would certainly lend itself toward an urbanism that the Valley is missing.I'm so torn on this race. I want to like it much more than I do. But, unfortunately, it's not really what I'm looking for.

It seems like everything here, like a Schwartz, comes with an up side and a down side.

Up side: You get to run up and down the strip. I mean, really, how cool is that? They only shut down the strip a couple of times a year, and to have it shut down for this it's extremely cool.

Down side: You're really only on the strip for a few miles. You get the full length on the way up, but only about halfway on the way back down. (Wow that sounds dirty.) And if you're doing the marathon you're going to spend a lot of your time on the west side of the 15, and nobody wants to be there.

Up side: It's an experience every runner needs to have!

Down side: It's an experience every runner needs to have. This past time (2013) my first mile was at about a 10min pace (I was looking for about 8min). There was just a wall of people that you couldn't get around. And despite the fact we were in the right corral for our starting time we spent the entire race passing people.

Up side: The organization. They've fixed most of the problems they had in 2011. Signs were clear, the finishing area was nice as you were just dumped off into the strip, which made walking back to the hotel easier.

Down side: Still room to improve. Once you entered the starting area you were stuck there; you weren't allowed to leave even to warm up. And from the start area it was still a good half-mile walk to the corral we were in.

This is a race to run once, and with no expectations of a PB/PR. I've done this race 4 years in a row now, and I don't think I'll be back for year 5. Unfortunately the annoyances have finally built up to the level where they overtake the good parts.What's wrong with me?!? I love popcorn but this place just didn't do it for me. Love the concept, merchandise, staff is incredibly friendly and generous with samples. I must agree with Mur T. I miss the popcorn smell and the availability of fresh popcorn. I did buy three different flavors, Chicago, Vegas and a chocolate but I think I was a little turned off by the way they are just stored in big containers in the back. I'm also not a fan of the hard shell coating. I think Maw N Paw in So Cal and Garrett's in Chicago have spoiled me.Paradise is ok if you aren't looking for something amazing. I can easily make the same quality sandwiches and soups at home. But I like to go out sometimes and have a sandwich somewhere else. Don't get me wrong they beat subway easily but they aren't great by any means. There is a young girl there who is too cool for school but everyone else is super nice. I will always continue to eat there, but not with high expections."Disappointed they advertise a healthy lifestyle yet offer no sandwiches that are veggie friendly. Only one hummus veggie friendly wrap that is not include in the half sand and smoothie deal.  Bummer!" tip posted night of dining at Tropical Smoothie.

Review now:
After I posted the tip above I heard from a fellow Yelper that they offer a no meat option, yet I was not offered that at this location. The woman taking my order wouldn't even let me order a sandwich with no meat, just cheese, only option was hummus veggie wrap. Luckily for them the smoothie was good and I gave them 3 stars for that and their quick service.Nothing special here. Just an average, forgettable burger. If there was a Five Guys in the area, I would pass on this place.Dear Fox Restaurants - I am slightly disappointed in this recently opened Fox creation. I am a fan of your other joints, and this one fell a little flat for me. We went to dinner with some work colleagues. They all seemed to enjoy their meals. But mine was a little disappointing. 

When we arrived my colleagues had already ordered wine and the pretzel appetizer. These were both great. I ordered the gnocchi for my entree - this was were I was disappointed. I think with some work this dish could be great. But it was -- ehh. The gnocchi (which is usually one of my favorite dishes) was a little mushy. I also did not think the sausage and mushrooms blended (taste wise) in the dish. 

I would go back and give this place another shot. Just order something different.Oh, the dulcet tones of RE CALL WALK ER while we attempted to enjoy our al fresco dinner.  Which isn't to say that I disagree with the sentiment - just that it interfered with the otherwise very pleasant ambiance of Coopers Tavern.

We stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago on the recommendation of our Airbnb host - when he learned we liked beer, he insisted that we try Coopers.  We were grateful for the recommendation!.  I really enjoyed the Irish Cobb salad - house-cured corned beef, oven-dried tomatoes, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, Dubliner, and scallion-mustard dressing - but we were disappointed in the beer cheese pretzels, as the "dip" was more like soup.

I'm not sure where to rate the service, exactly.  I think our server was new, but she was definitely enthusiastic, peppering us for our drink order before we'd had a chance to open the menu.  When my husband asked about a beer listed on the menu, she informed him that they were out but it was SO GOOD.  Very helpful!  He really wanted the beer, and now would obviously have to take his drinking dollars elsewhere if he wanted to try something that was obviously recommended.

Despite that overly grumpy digression, we'd definitely give this place another shot.Cute guys wearing tight black shirts selling cupcakes covered in glitter?  Yes please.  Nothing more to say.4.5 for really nice rooms but 1.5 on the service. Scored a 1 BR suite that had a living room AND a screen that came down that also turned into a projector for the tv. Sweet set up for the kitchen as well. Makes sense since these were condos that didn't sell and got converted into hotel rooms. 

Here's the downside: the service SUCKS. The funny thing is, this room was comped because the first time my boyfriend stayed here and got such horrible service that they comped our room this time (hey, you can't turn down a free room). This time, they didn't clean our room. We got back to our room around 5PM, saw house keepers outside and assumed they'd clean our room. When they didn't (and left!), we called customer service who said they would send someone to clean our room. We leave and come back around 1AM and our  room hasn't been touched at all. We call down to customer service and they said that our room got a note that said we "refused service". What the hell? Finally they send someone up after 20 minutes (poor lady) and we don't get back to our room until 2AM. That's pretty crappy way to end the night, especially if you've been out all day. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but cmon when most people stay at a hotel, they aren't expecting much. In fact, the only thing you expect is for them to clean your room. That's it. If you can't even do that, that's pretty much a fail in my book. 

So, like I said, really sweet rooms but man, no wonder all the ratings gave it such crappy ratings--service sucks! C'mon PH Towers, you gotta know that customer service is HUGE.Decided to drop in to fulfill a sweet tooth. Walked in close to closing time, so most of the sweets have been sitting out all day. The guy behind the counter (who I think was also the owner) was very friendly, and answered any questions we had. I ordered the tiramisu.. Pretty good. My boyfriend had a cannoli.. Eh. Let's just say we liked the tiramisu better. The layers in the tiramisu were a good lady finger/espresso/cream ratio. The cannoli fell flat, the shell wasn't crunchy. More soggy than anything.
Gave it 3 stars for the tiramisu & customer service.Great service but the massage therapist are hit and miss.  I enjoy the rates and how close this location is to my home.  I would try to find a therapist that I like but it's more important that I can just call ahead about 30-45 min and get scheduled which is great.  Very clean location with nice furniture and I always buy the 3 massages for $150 since that is a pretty good deal as long as I use them before they expire.If you're looking for bang for your buck and by that I mean HUGE portions, this is a quality place to eat.  While there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.

I had  the Sage Fried Chicken and a Bloody Mary.  The Bloody Mary was the first one I've ever tried and it was delicious.  Peppery, with the perfect amount of Vodka mixed in.  The fried chicken was average and the bacon waffle was a little disappointing.  They basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them bacon waffles.  Good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that I was looking for.

It wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  For the price, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and I wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.My boyfriend and I got the corned beef hash to split. It was good but nothing to rave about or go out of my way for. The portion was huge, which was a definite plus. It had corned beef hash with country fried potatoes, an egg and a biscuit on the side.

The wait time is absolutely ridiculous here until it hits about 10 pm. From then til about 5 am, your in the clear and I say go for it!

Located inside of The Quad, on the second floor. 
The inside is relatively on the small side considering how popular this place is.

I would probably come back again, but try something different.This place made me hash house a go go to the bathroom. Okay that may not even be true but I wanted to write it anyway.

Not a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!

I ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.

Every single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.

Strawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)

Rosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.

But then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.

Computers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada.I agree with most of my fellow reviewers that no matter what the service is going to be like, most of us will continue to shop at Victorias. Where else are we going to go? Since I have a V.S. credit card they are always sending me coupons for free underwear or a couple bucks off...which I realize is just an excuse to get you in the store. I fall for it every time. Of course I want my free underwear! oh, and maybe while I'm here I'll just take a look. They are so sneaky that way!
Anyhoo, I find the customer service to be either hot or cold. Sometimes you're bombarded with 10 associates asking to help you, and other times no one says boo to you. I guess you just fend for yourself and if you need help you can find someone to ask. I have no problem with that. 
The store is usually stocked pretty well with sizes and selection and generally speaking the sales staff is pretty friendly.  They know they have us hooked though, right???Let me start by saying that the room itself was okay. Good pressure in the shower and free hbo. Free wifi and a hot tub in the parking lot (seriously).

Then let's get to the bad:
* Tons of construction outside the hotel. Like literally every piece of Main Street is covered in cones and pylons and great huge signs directing traffic. There were no left turns out of the hotel and after the first couple days you couldn't even turn onto the street from a couple directions.
* The neighborhood was a little sketchy. We didn't have any problems, but it wasn't a great area.
* The pillows were no larger than breathmints. Like seriously, smaller than my head. And they felt if they put 5 of them on the bed that would make up for it.
* I could hear everything going on in every room around me.I've been to this place twice. The first time I went for a new set of acrylic nails, I didn't have to wait too long and the tech (Terry, I think?) did a great job - I was very pleased.

I went back about 2 weeks later for a fill and left extremely disappointed. Terry was not available, but that was my fault, I should've made an appointment. I was assigned to a male tech who took over an hour! I asked him a couple of questions - one regarding the type of fill and the other regarding a nail color and he answered "I don't know" to both. Nobody else was there to help so I just went with it. I tried telling him the length I was looking for and he just nodded but ignored my request. It seemed as if he was annoyed and hated what he was doing. Needless to say, the final product was very disappointing. The nails were too thin, two of them broke within a few days and the nail polish peeled.

Maybe I'll try a third time? With Terry.Every time I've been at this shop Ely hooks it up with a really nice cut!  Also make sure to go when it's not busy since he's the only barber.I tried to avoid this place when I need a car wash, gas, or a few snacks. When this place opened, the service and atmosphere was great. Since that time, a decline in appearance and service has set in. The store looks similar to a run down Circle K on the inside. Outside you are likely to be approached by the car detailers looking to sale you wash and service or by someone asking for change or a cigarette. Getting a car wash usually pits you against someone who cares nothing for their job nor has any level of intelligence. After returning to the serviceman for my air freshener that is supposed to come with one of the washes and having him ask for my receipt and then go back into the building to verify the purchase (despite already having my receipt and having literally just watched me go by minutes earlier), I stopped having any type of faith in this place. It is frequented by teens who sit outside smoking or asking for smokes and has become nothing more than a run down gas station. It is a shame because it looked so nice when it was first built.My favorite things at Old Navy are their tees, tanks, and pajamas.  They have a big selection of jeans, but you have to commit to trying on a whole bunch before you find the right fit/style.  It seems like you could even grab two or three of the same size/style and they'd still all fit differently.

This location does carry maternity clothes, but don't look in the women's clothes section - the maternity clothes are in the other corner of the store, with the baby clothes.I ordered a frozen coffee and when I received it, it was runny and lacked flavor and was way over priced. I'll stay going to Starbucks!So far I haven't had the best experience.  There have been a couple miscommunications that I wasn't happy about.  Our first visit to the store a young lady helped us and referred us to their website to use build -a -tux so we went home and did that, came back the next weekend to find out that we didn't even need to do that.  My son got measured for his tuxedo on that visit and I was told I could come back and pick up the tuxedo when it was ready.  I got there today and they needed my son to make sure it fit well.  It's a 40 minute drive for us so we have to come back again tomorrow.  I talked to the manager, John and he was very generous and understanding.  Even more important he listened to my complaints and made me feel better about coming back.  Crossing my fingers the tux fits tomorrow!Yep. It's a Target.I tried to order a pizza tonight for delivery and the wait time was so long I didn't even bother. 

Last time we ordered a pizza I remember the delivery time they told me was a hour to an hour twenty, but it took probably an hour 45! The pizza was good thankfully.I tend to avoid chains and I don't eat burgers and fries very often, so this place isn't really catering to me, anyhow... but for what it was, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.

Here's what I didn't love:

I thought that the fries were supposed to be bottomless, but the server did not replenish them. 

The restaurant is really loud.

For what I had -- burger, fries, and a soda -- I ended up leaving $20 for my portion of the meal. That's too expensive for what I had. I don't want to pay that much for a meal like that unless I'm at a theme park or somewhere else with more of a geographic monopoly... or unless it's like the best burger and fries of all time, which it wasn't.


Here's what I did like: 

Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were seated quickly (party of 4). 

The two teenagers who were in our party wanted to share a milkshake and the server brought it already split into two for them, which was nice. 

My burger (guacamole bacon) was cooked the way I asked (medium rare -- sometimes places like this overcook even when I ask for medium rare) and tasted pretty good. It wasn't my favorite burger, but it was fine. 

I upgraded to sweet potato fries, and I liked them!

Anyhow, it's Red Robin. It's a chain. You know what it's going to be before you go, probably. We went because the teenagers in our party wanted to go. It wasn't my choice, but I thought I would share. There is a Red Robin really n ear my house in Delaware, and I never go and likely won't go. No judgment if you like it... it's just not my thing!This place is a bit unprofessional. We never get out order right. We use them as delivery most of the time. I usually venture to Anthem to get it right.This Starbucks is weird. Drive through and walk-up only. Only outdoor seating. Weird can be good! But, it wasn't great. 

It's essentially in the parking lot of a hotel, and I visited while I was staying in that hotel. They had the same ratio as my local Starbucks... my drink was right 3 out 4 times. However, the one time it WAS wrong - it wasn't just a LITTLE wrong - it was completely the wrong drink.

Definitely not somewhere you'd go to do work in less-than-perfect weather, and it might as well be located ON the highway... i.e. there is a ton of road noise.  

However... friendly staff. 

Standard Starbucks experience.The only reason I go to this Circle K is because its a 3 minute walk from my apartment and the gas is usually 20 cents cheaper per gallon than other gas stations less than a mile up 7th st. Be cautious when they scan the merchandise didn't realize I was double charged for a bag of chips until I got home because I used my debit card. Was told only the manager can refund the chips but her hours are weird. When I did catch the manager she was in a hurry to leave and said she would call me which she never did.  See a lot of unusual people hanging out and asking for change. Had one guy try to sell me a bike and the major selling point was that he swore it wasn't stolen. The employees have to deal with a lot of unruly customers.Ok fellow Yelpers...it seems many of you are yelping about the hotel. I believe this location is specifically for the restaurant and NOT the hotel.

The restaurant is located inside the Forum shops in Caesar's Palace hotel.

The food is your average American food with average prices. The service we received was pretty good though. She was really friendly, outgoing, and funny at times. The only thing we had to complain about was the fact it was quite dim and the dim lighting kind of made us sleepy or hurt our eyes trying to see our foods.

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and it was a good size. I almost finished it. It was also pretty tasty. Everyone else ordered burgers and other sandwhiches that looked decent too. Again, there's nothing super special about their foods. But it isn't that bad and there is a lot to choose from.After a busy grocery shopping outing at Walmart, my tummy was growling and I didnt want to go home and cook. What's the next best thing? L&L! I was right across the shopping center. I made a quick call on my way back to my car and placed my order. I figure by the time I unload and drive over there, the food will be ready! Now thats being efficient!

I order the Loco Moco, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, and two pieces of Spam Musubi. The total cost came out to around $21. The food is very consistent with the other L&L's I've been to. Never a complaint from me. Would I come here again? Definitely. Would I recommend what I ordered? Definitely! You really cant go wrong here.I heart their chicken and green chile soup and their bottomless mango iced tea but have yet to find an entree that's worth coming back for...Drove a long time to get here because of the super high yelp rating. But I don't think it should be that high review, at least for my first time experience. 
We got the Carne asada plate, taste just average and the size is small. The inside is small and very simple but seems very busy during lunch time.  I don't think I will drive back here for lunch. Maybe it is good for ppl live near by.First off - I'll try them again, so that's a good start. But second, this was disappointing. Delivery was late and the food quality needed some work. It probably would have been better if we had eaten there, but the big problem is that the food was delivered cold. We ordered a  fried chicken dinner and a steak sandwich. The chicken had a nice flavor but it was tough. cold, and the pieces were small. I think if we got it closer to when it came out of the kitchen it would have been much better.  The sandwich also had a good flavor, but because it was cold the bread was dry and the flavor of the steak was lost. We'll try it again soon and hopefully they'll overcome the shortfalls of our first visit. Maybe if they had a better carrier than a plastic bag to deliver it then the food would have been delivered hot and certainly would have been better.  We'll see.I'm didn't think I was really a Dress Barn kind of shopper. I was in a pinch for a decent, somewhat conservative cocktail style dress for a wedding and NYE party I was attending. I was on a SUPER budget and in a major time crunch. It was close to the holidays and I was doing everything in my power to avoid a mall (Fashion Show and Galleria) and avoid Town Square. I was feeling quite anti-crowd you could say. I came into Dress Barn (Located in the Aroyo Crossing shopping center near Michael's and Famous Footwear) after unsuccessful trips to Marshalls, Ross and TJ Max, thinking, "Oh what the heck, it's worth a shot." 

I was pleasantly surprised by several things. First, the cleanliness of the store and the availability of product. I thought the shelves would be empty and the store wrecked, that was not the case. Second was the quality of the clothing. Much to my surprise I found some really cute stuff, AND, they had sizes that fit me in stock! The prices were pretty decent, and the quality of the clothes was equally decent. The staff who helped me in the dressing room and during check out were not overly friendly, but they did handle the job. 

Wow Dress Barn, I was surprised and impressed! I guess I might need to come in here every once in a while to check out their every day and work clothes. I though Dress Barn was for "moms" turns out I was wrong. It's ALSO for young adults (just avoid the mom type stuff)! Hmmm...who'd of thunk it!Gamestop (AKA Funcoland, EB Games, etc.) has been a nationwide game store chain for years. They certainly have no shortage of stores around the Vegas Valley, as well.

This place is all about video games, so the associates are generally pretty knowledgeable about the subject. They are usually nice guys as well, so that's always a plus. Typically, any time I go in the store I am asked if I am looking for anything, and while I am usually not, they don't seem to have a problem with people just there to browse. 

Gamestop carries just accessories and games for pretty much every video game system from the Playstation 2 up to the modern age. They have a solid selection of used titles, so you can often get some bargains on that end. Likewise, the chain has a frequent buyer program where you can save money and gain extra money when doing a trade-in. What systems they carry games for, though, as far as slightly older ones go (PS2, Gamecube, original XBOX) tends to differ from store to store. 

I have one major complaint with Gamestop however - they severely downsized their on-hand merchandise in recent years. I used to be able to come in this place and get memorabilia/toys/etc., plus cheap movies people had traded in. Now it's pretty much games/systems/accessories only. I liked the way this chain thought outside the box, but now they're back to "just games." Likewise, there aren't a whole lot of bargains/savings on "new" merchandise (though this is typical of most stores that sell games.)

If you have a Gamestop by you, they are definitely worth checking out, just don't go in expecting an out-of-this-world selection and prices.As far as Vegas bars go this place gets two thumbs up. There food is excellent they have some good beers on tap including Guinness. The staff is friendly and attentive. They have a DJ on weekends with a good local crowd.I was able to get a side salad and rice & beans plate for under $5. It was a nutritious, vegetarian, and cheap. The salad was just romaine lettuce (not that shitty iceberg) with chopped tomatoes and tortilla strips. It was definitely not mindblowing but at the $1-2 range, I can't complain. My rice and beans plate was surprisingly large and in charge. However, the rice was bland but fluffy. The black beans (you can choose either black or pinto) are the real gem; they were cooked perfectly and topped with cotija crumble cheese. Baja offers a salsa bar and most of it is okay. Even the hottest sauce doesn't have that nice fire punch I was craving. The pico de gallo was unimpressive because the tomatoes were unfresh and mushy. But they have banana peppers and jalepenos. And a nice bonus: next door is a Starbucks so you can have a your caffeine midday fix, too! I know I'm judging a Mexican fastfood restaurant based on a salad and r&b plate, but hear me out, rice and beans are a simple staple, and sometimes simple is all I need.The Skinny: some pretty great entrees, some not so good... skip the bread pudding (3) service: slow service - took a while to place our orders(1.5), value: remains to be seen (2).

After the great experience the last time, we brought all our friends to feel the love that is Mundo. But the love just wasn't there tonight.

It took a while for us to order our dishes and to hear even what the specials were tonight. It basically took at least 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to come around and take our order.

I got the roasted chicken dish with tamales which was excellent - great flavours. Paired with the sweet tamales, and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the filet which was only alright. The side of mushroom didn't appear to be "wild" at all - yup! $8 for a small side of plain old button mushrooms. Would definitely not recommend this side.

Another member of the table ordered the tortilla soup and taquitos which she said were both good.

Unfortunately, the carnitas was a rather poor compared to the other dishes on the table. Like a previous reviewer noted - some appeared dry. 

We did order the bread pudding which was fair at best. Nothing special. Would probably not order again.

Service, as I mentioned, was slow tonight and the timing of the dishes were poor.

Overall, a significantly less pleasant experience than the last time. I'm downgrading this place to a 3 instead of a 4.Coffee was on par with other coffee bean locations, but the place is small and there were some kids getting busy in the entry for way too long. 

There's a Dunkin Donuts next door. I'll probably go there in the future.Though the smell of the place can really get to you, the instructors here are amazing.  Down side is the people at the front desk are extremely rude and not very friendly.  If customer service were good all around I would have continued to come to this studio. But since it's all the way on the other side of town I think I'll have to opt out for a more welcoming environment.  

Other than the downsides, they have a clean changing area with 2 showers where they provide body wash, shampoo, and conditioner so you can wash off all the nasty sweat after your classes. 

Try catching Summer and Stacy. They're both awesome in their own way.Cleanliest Walgreens bathroom out of all VEGAS on the strip at least.We went here for a quick snack and got a vanilla milkshake and a side of fries. The fries were a good portion for one person, and the milkshake wasn't as thick as we normally know Johnny Rockets for. The service was good.

Other than that this Johnny Rockets is the only place in the food court that's open 24/7, there's nothing special.This is a pretty nice neighborhood joint.  Pretty typical - but nice.  Stopped by and found some nice happy hour specials.  $5 appetizers and cheap draught beer.  Mostly a gaming establishment but it is a good place to throw a few beers back!Yes, the sticky buns are great.

My grandparents would think this was one of the best restaurants in the world.  The menu is very old-school with rich, heavy dishes.  We started with the recommended shrimp pepper pot.  It was delicious, but we both commented on how heavy the butter seemed in the dish, and how it could have been lightened up with a little olive oil.  The house salad was romaine lettuce with a sherry vinegarette.  Again, a more modern menu would probably use different greens.  Our entrees were huge - my prime rib was cooked nicely but lacked a little seasoning. My wife had the fish special: halibut in hollindaise sauce.  Again, huge portion, very rich.  Coffee was very watery and reminded me of dinners at grandmas house.

The patio is amazing with beautiful views. The menu a throwback to an earlier generation of "fine dining." it was nostalgic to eat food like this, but i doubt we'll come back.Valentines 2/14/11

Bopped in here for a quick margarita tonight before we left the strip. I have only had a full meal here once but the burrito I had was $15 and worth every penny. The burrito was double the size of a Chipotle style and even more tasty. Margaritas are decent price for being apart of the Mandalay Bay chain as well as the authentic tacos. 

Mostly a noisy bar atmosphere but well decorated with a great friendly staff.

Good place to catch a quick drink of a meal before heading out on the strip.Stopped here with two of my buddies to eat dinner. Before getting ready for a night on the strip. We were pretty hungry. This place is ok. Nothing amazing. Beer and food was all we needed to refuel for a long night. And that we got.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga. Came with beans and rice. The usual stuff. Buddies ordered some beef tacos, and nachos. Had a few rounds of beers. Also they were debuting some new tequila that night. So we got complimentary shots. Free is always good. Prices were ok. A little overpriced but thats expected. The atmosphere is pretty cool. They had a live band playing Spanish music that night. Not too loud, as others have stated. It's not a rowdy get your ass kicked kinda place. At least I didn't feel it was. But id come back if I was craving Mexican food in Vegas.This place was mediocre..no complaints really but nothing really wowed me to come back..The breakfast burritos are very good.  Everything else I've tried hasn't been as good as the Filoberto's on Arizona Ave and Ocotillo.GREAT food and I would definitely recommend it for carry out.  This is about as authentic as it gets.  A long wait for your food can be expected, but is well worth the wait.   However, I'm deducting 1 point for service and another for atmosphere.  

We recently stopped in for lunch, and were the only guests.  When placing our orders, the server seemed annoyed that we had come in.  It felt like we were interupting something very important that was taking place in the back.  We did not receive our drink order until our food arrived about 25 minutes after we ordered.  It would not have seemed as long had it not been for the terrible atmosphere.

The dining room is very bright with tall ceilings, so sounds echo very easily.  Some other people stopped in for lunch, and we all spoke very softly to not share our conversations with each other.  If they'd turned on some music, it would have been much less uncomfortable.  They did have a TV on, but it was muted.  

I think with a few minor adjustments to the front of house staff and the atmosphere, this place could definitely earn a 5 star rating.  They've definitely got the food for it!Despite how good the food was, and it was AMAZING. The service was awful. Our waitress wasnt really interested in helping us. She forgot half of one of the orders at our table, it took almost 10 mins to get water. Then when I ordered a black and tan she brought me a full guiness because the Bass keg was empty and they needed to change it... ummm yea wouldnt you ask before you assume?
Not to mention it took forever for her to return with our checks.we stayed at city center and had some time to kill between check out and our flight so we went here bc it was super close..to continue with our one meal a day during this trip.. 

we split the apps..
-chicken wings: had a nice kick from the spice
-corn dog puppies: mini corndogs with fries.. i liked these the best
-roast beef sliders: only thought these were ok 

this isn't a place i'd crave on my next visit but i wouldn't mind giving it another shot..Place is pretty good but expensive! Almost everything on the menu is $20 bucks or more! Had the lobster rolls which was good. They have lots of beer on tap.. Pretty fun crowd. If your only in the crystal palace mall/Aria area this is worth the short walk but i wouldn't go out of my way to just come here.My boyfriend built up this place nearly every time we passed it, so naturally I had to take him there on his birthday for dessert.

Let me just start by saying, I am a real snob about certain desserts-and bread pudding is one of them. I grew up in the south and I have my own personal preferences for how it should be done. And I was NOT crazy about their bread pudding at all. Not only was it very, very overly egg-y and soft (bordering on runny), the flavor lacked anything like a true rum raisin bread pudding. Maybe they put some sauce on the top too far in advance, but the general flavor was not traditional at all to me.Big disappointment. 

Now, the donuts they served us complimentary for his birthday were amazing. Specifically, that perfect caramel sauce that comes along side them. WOW. I could drink this stuff by the bucket, it is dangerous. 

The place itself is interesting, a small, quaint place that I imagine gets very loud when packed. Service was good as well. I might return for a meal if they put SOMEthing on the menu that was vegetarian : /I had a really good burger today.  Mushroom and swiss, juicy burger, lots of mushrooms, good bun!  Yep, good burger.  The fries were ok - a little too salty for me.  My daughter's chicken strips/fries were the typical kid's meal fare.  The whole place wasn't as clean as I'd like considering they weren't busy and they had lots of staff.  But I will go back for a burger.Has all of the usual suspects that one needs from a Starbucks but Holy Long Lines!!  All day!  It's right near the elevators so it's the main Starbucks in the MGM. (I think there are 3 on the main floor of the MGM).  OK selection of food.The breakfast buffet was delicious, well stocked, and had a great variety of choices.

I enjoyed the chorizo and eggs, and the biscuits and gravy.

It's a good buffet, for not a lot of money. I'll be back.3/16/11

Came in to see what Pomo had to offer on their happy hour menu-- certain cocktail drinks are half-off (I had the lemon drop, or something akin to that, with lemon vodka and fresh lemon juice).  The two pizzas I've tried here were just OK.  The Quattro Formaggi (mozzarella, provolone, gorgonzola, and parmigiano) was very salty, but good, crispy crust that didn't stay crispy for very long (not even ten minutes!), and the Quattro Stagioni (minus 'shrooms) was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again, as the crust was very soggy due to the tomato sauce.  Such a shame...  

Order the bruschetta!  I had it for happy hour-- sadly, HH menu only offers discounts on cocktails, not food.  Boo!  So, I ordered the bruschetta to try while waiting for the pizza... I should've just ordered two of the bruschetta!  Loved the crunch of the bread, and the toppings tasted so fresh!  

The panna cotta I had for dessert was good- you wouldn't have to twist my arm to order it again.  :)  (But of course, I'd like to try other desserts on the menu first.  That is, if they aren't off-limits...)  Mom liked the millefoglie w/ chantilly cream and strawberries offered to her as a token of appreciation when we had dinner there on Pomo's first-year anniversary.  I really enjoyed the slice of "anniversary cake" I was given, since I couldn't have the millefoglie special (due to powdered sugar and cornstarch in this pastry).

Service was very relaxed and probably modeled after the service you'd find in Italy-- it brought us to recall the same nonchalant attitude we encountered when we visited Rome many years ago... (Most, if not all, of Pomo's servers and bussers are Italians from the "old world," complete w/ accents!).  Mom and I noted that most of the dinner customers here seemed to be Italians, w/ many of them carrying an air of being visitors, or tourists, not locals.  

Two visits and the only things I can vouch for are the lemon cocktail, the bruschetta, and the anniversary cake (which wasn't even on the regular menu!).  One more try, perhaps...Beware of reservations. On two ocaasins they were lost. The third one done thru open table was not lost but was for 7:15 and or outside. We were finally seated at 745 inside. Had to check with the less than helpful hostesses who seemed either overwhelmed or none to bright at least three times.  First was told it would be ready soon, then was told  they were paying the check THEN the table we were supposed to have was ordering  dessert. SAY WHAT? Was with another couple we had bragged about the food about.  It was a liitle embarrassing. Not sure we will go back.Ok.  So I had heard about SmashBurger for a while, and considering I was in the area, I figured, might as well see what the fuss is about.  After perusing the menu, I decided that the Sin City Smash and some sweet potatoes fries sounded very appealing.  I order, they give me my number and I sit and wait.

Finally, the food had arrived.  Mind you the wait wasn't that bad, 5 minutes maybe, decent time, nothing to mark down on.  I take my bite, and I'm overwhelmed by the onions.  There were 2 types of onions in the burger that it pretty much took over.  I could taste the burger and the egg, but it was well masked by the onions.  The burger was well cooked and very good, and the egg was nice, though a little overcooked.  Altogether an good burger.  The sweet potatoes fries were tossed in olive oil and rosemary (and I think garlic, not sure on that one).  It was very offsetting for the sweet potato fries, though I'm sure it would taste better as the normal SmashFries instead.

All in all, I was kinda let down after all the hype I had been hearing.  I'll probably be back, as it is a better burger than 99% of fast food, but as of now, probably not too often.The third or fourth time I went was today, a Saturday afternoon, Always have had good quality, but I have a couple of pet peeves. First the cost, I think kicking it down a is not going to happen but...How about not hosing me for 99 cents for adding a smallish amount of Mushrooms on my Burger and the Fries are 2.69  (i think) and super small order size, yes cool Iron basket with high tech wax paper liner but please Load it up.
I did enjoy a chipolte Bun today and it had a Spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.
So there you go.So the burgers are good, as most people on Yelp have posted, but the experience could be better for a number of reasons.  We had the $20 dinner "special" for 2 - where you get 2 burgers, 1 order of fries for $20.  So when I got the bill, I was charged $21.25, and not $20 (this is not including tax), so I was thinking "wait the special is advertised for $20, NOT $21.25!  

The server informed me that I was charged an "extra" $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here, because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!  Shysters.

I reluctantly give 3 stars because the burger was good and the service was also pretty good.  But Zin should include some food on the side with their burgers, because when you order a burger you are getting it stand-alone, no fries, no veggies, nutin.

If you want to add "extra" on your burger, be careful.Two reasons to come here, you like metal music or you are still hankering for more drinks late at night or early morning when the bars are closed.  If you a fan of metal and want drinks late at night, this place is the place for you.

This place a labyrinth, rooms into corridors, into more rooms and more surprises.  We ended up in a room with a pool table, and its own juke box, I found of the bars and I just kept going back to it because I didn't want to get lost.  Everything would have being fine but the pool cues were as crooked as a NY politician and the juke box started getting pricey and the bar I did fine was always packed.  They served drinks but the prices were slightly higher than the other bars I visited my time in Edinburgh.There is absolutely nothing special about this bar whatsoever, but it is perfectly nice, and nice is better than horrible. It is pretty small, but has a friendly atmosphere, especially during the evenings, when they have live traditional Scottish folk music. The band are great for background music and are especially welcome in the cold Edinburgh winter. With the unusual addition of a video of a fire on the wall, you feel like you are in a traditional pub.

The bar is tiny but still manages to have all the normal drinks, with a good selection of bottled beers and ciders. The food is what you would expect from a pub, and is relatively cheap. They are particularly proud of their buffalo burgers (sourced locally. Yes apparently we do have buffalo in Edinburgh) which are apparently much healthier than beef, with less fat and reduce cholesterol. To be honest though it tasted exactly the same and my cholesterol, as far as I know, hasn't massively dropped (or increased for that matter, just pretty much stayed the same). 

They have a pub quiz once a week which is quite easy but a good laugh. Overall the pub is a nice place to come for a few chilled out drinks, but not much more than that.Been wanting to try this since I moved here because of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp. While the service here is very good, I would have to say that the food is just OK. ( based on what I ordered - Thelma's Special).DATE: August 20, 2009

I was leaving for Indonesia 2 weeks later and the boy and I had just spent the night before talking about our plans for the future.. As soon as I reached home, I would talk to my relatively conservative social figure of an Asian Dad and announce that I was ready to get married - to this "fresh-out-of-college American boy" he never met. Considering the high risk of meeting opposition from my side, we decided to make a quiet, private commitment to each other in the form of a marriage license in the city that sealed the fate of our relationship 8 months before. When we called concierge at 1:30am the night before to find out where to go, we were informed that we'd have to go to the courthouse (which was closed at the time) and get a license before meeting an officiant. At around 1pm the next day, we headed for the Clark County Courthouse.

Getting a marriage license here is a pretty simple process:

1. Fill Out Forms
2. Wait In Line
3. Pay + Answer Questions For The Official To Complete License

However, I can't imagine that anyone who were stumbling in here drunk off their asses would be able to go through with the process. Contrary to how the movies make it seem, it's not as simple as wandering into a chapel and getting it done. You have to be lucid enough to fill out forms and then coherent enough to talk to the official BEFORE getting to the chapel. There's no way you can do that completely knackered..The customer service in the childcare dept is subpar. What is that all about, Lifetime. It seems like the facility, when it comes to childcare, are more interested in telling the members what they cannot not do for them instead of what they can.
Other than this, the facility is great! May cancel my membership if the childcare customer service does not improve.I love the staff here, always friendly and they know what I drink. I come with my dog and sit outside. Few places in Vegas that you can do that. Always get my order right. I like their pastries though I wish they had a better selection. More chocolate cake please!!! Free WiFi... Thank you.Time for another review...my first visit to the NEW Al's wasent so great.....but in my review I did say I would be back to try the beef.

Let me start by saying...I am a VERY tough critic....I know what I like and if you advertise anything Chicago...that is what I compare to...not other local business.....

I stopped by at 11am ...(my thinking is everything will be fresh)...and I did order a regular size beef and small fry....

I was still not thrilled that it cost over $10.00 for a beef and small fry...however... I dont mind paying more if I feel its worth it...and in this girls opinion....the beef was TERRIFIC!

I did order the beef wet...with au jus and their homemade peppers on the side.

The beef (as previously reviewed by someone else) was dry and a bit bland...however...once I poured the au jus and peppers over it.....BAM!!!!

The flavors EXPLODED!  

The sandwich was ample and two of us shared it and we were both very satisfied.

I like a beef sandwich that is NOT thick pieces of beef...and this was exactly that...

Lots of beef and the bread was nicely saturated in the yummy juices....

When I was in the restaurant I had the pleasure of speaking to Michelle...one of the owners  who was very interested in my opinion....so much so that she asked me to call her and let her know what I think...

I did just that....so Michelle....this review is for you....and for all of you Chicagoians out there who enjoy a really hefty and flavorful Italian beef.

If you went to Al's once....my suggestion is.....give it another try and order something different to get the true experience.

I will DEFINATELY be back for the Beef   

I realize food is really  personal preference....

Some think Lukes is good....to me Lukes is BAD food at EXTREMELY high prices...I tried it once and wont ever go back....so bad I went against my rule of always trying a restaurant  at least twice...just to make sure....  

So, if you are comparing Al's to Luke...NO COMPARISON!!!

Al's WINS any day of the week....

It is my opinion...that if it a Beef sandwich you are looking for....no need to go any further than "Al's Italian Beef"!My group of friends takes an annual trip to Vegas which went on a two-year hiatus and resumed in 2009.  Each year, we stay at Bally's:  at first because of its central location and low rates, and more recently because we accumulate enough points to have the rooms discounted or comped.  It's a good "starter" hotel, and we find it good enough to keep coming back.

Both the hotel and the casino are the plainest of the plain, but they serve a purpose.  Usually we stay here and gamble part of the time next door at Paris.  On this trip, we did a four-hour stint at the Bally's pai gow table on Friday night which should set us up with the comps for next year.

There's really almost nothing to say about the hotel.  We've stayed here so much that the rooms look eerily identical; even last weekend, after three years had passed since I had been there, it was like deja vu.  The water pressure in the shower was really crappy this time; otherwise, it's just a hotel room.  You shouldn't be spending much time in the room anyway, right?Our south tower room had great view of the Strip and casino isn't so large that you get lost. Room was a bit tired and there are newer, cheaper options. Not bad.What's to say? It's a pretty expensive but homemade tasting food(Is that a good or bad thing - who's to say?) Like another review said - the cheese tasted like Sargento and I can't disagree. Because it tastes like something you could make yourself - its easy to say "whats the point?" I've had it a couple times and I appreciate the taste and price and its nice to goto when Ian's is full but don't expect to be Wow'd or something.I really, really wanted to love Johnny Smalls as they have a great concept and great potential.    The problem was they fell short on execution.    Sevice was decent on a Saturday night but the food was just "ok".

The best things we tried were the fried green beans and the short rib.    The bowl of beans was huge, the short rib, tiny.     Everything else ranged from "ok" to "meh".   The "meh" items were the tikka masala flatbread, the chili dogs and the sweet potato tots.    "Ok" were the Mighty balls, the PB&J (note - I am not a PB&J fan to begin with), carne asada tacos (these were only luke warm - if they were hotter, they would have been alot better).

If they get their act together this place could be really fun but they just aren't quite there just yet.There's no denying this venue isn't immaculately kitted out with the latest lighting, slouchy booths, opulent wall decor and generally sexy looking bar space. I just can't pinpoint what exactly the vibe is supposed to be, as despite all the snazzy decor surrounding you, it's hard to really get a feel of the kind of club atmosphere Shanghai is aiming for. 

Last time I was in here was during the week, and it was pretty quiet to be honest, however it is fairly large as night clubs go, so it'd probably tricky to fill it up completely, particularly on a week night. Weekends are most certainly busy, what with this being a club on George Street, plus the fact people come down from Le Monde, the bar above Shanghai. Lots of dark corners for dark snogging deeds, if that's your thing, and plenty of dance space.Fun vintage little hotspot. Parking is very limited and the drinks are way overpriced. About $10-$14 if you get one of there specially made drinks. 
I do love this place for dancing though! It's right between the feel of a club and a bar. They play old school through current hits! I first found this place and now my friends have fallen in love with it as well.I have always been a fan of Rubios, especially their lobster burritos they have a few times of the year.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate at this Rubios I am pretty sure I got a bad batch of something because I was ill for the next couple of days.  Hopefully they get things worked out.3.5 stars rounded down!

When they first introduced this program a couple years ago, it was a GREAT deal. $49 all you can eat for 24 hours right on the Strip is a STEAL.  For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.

However, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. 

The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.

Besides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.

The reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.

I don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.

However, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  

So it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!

#GLUTTONY!The Which-Wich style of Hot-Dog orders, this place packs a solid frank. The sweet potato fries are recommended and the portion is fairly large. At the end of the day, I had trouble paying nearly $10 for a hot dog, fries, and a drink; especially when Costco is right down the road and it's $1.65 for a dog and drink. If I want a Fancy Dog, I'd recommend Short Leash Dogs in Phoenix. Unfortunately, they're not out on the west side!

I plan to go back and try a couple different options.I used to rave about this place to my friends and family, but my last visit here was just ok. I had the Kiki's Burger on my last visit and the taste was ok. The presentation of the burger was something they just slapped together. The bottom bun was hard...maybe the bread was old. It's hard to imagine that this restaurant would have old bread to serve because it is packed with people. Be prepared to wait a while for a table. The hostess will try to convince you to drive to their other location which is about 20-25 minutes away...not 15 min unless you are a race car driver. Lastly, the service was horrible. Our server or the kitchen lost our order and we were left waiting a long time for our food. What is worse is that the server never acknowledged that our order was not put it right away and did nothing to try to rush our food out.I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.Its a cool little spot, good food and caters to the younger crowd. Not that they won't give you the same service if you were older but the decor and ambiance is more for the younger hipster folks.I felt pretty let down by Rocket on my first visit last week.

It was lunch time and yes the cafe was busy but the staff were shocking.  They were all nice, but there was no order whatsoever and as a result, everyone was running around but nothing really seemed to get done in a proper or timely manner.  
It was like everyone was meant to do everything instead of something like:

1 person take orders, deliver food and bus tables
1 person man the till
2 people make food

There were easily 4 or 5 employees when I was there and we waited aaages to order (only to have 3 people then ask to take our order), my friend ordered soup and a sandwich which came out a good 10 minutes before my dish, and getting the bill was painful - we eventually had to go up to the till only to find that they had no record of our order.  

Additionally, I ordered the burrito which was fine, but was *really* heavy on the onion which was diced into the salsa so unavoidable.

Overall, as I said I felt pretty let down.  The staff were nice and I would come back for takeaway but the manic air to the place made for a less than pleasant eat in experience.To make this review authentic...I'M SHOUTING.

IT'S TOO LOUD! WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU IN THIS CLUB. THIS STEAK IS DELICIOUS? WHAT DID YOU SAY? THE OYSTERS ARE YUMMY? HUH? WHAT? NEVERMIND!!!!!The atmosphere and the crowd is better than the food and the food isn't bad by any means.  

When the waitresses come out with sparklers and shots for the whole restaurant you know you're in Vegas.
P.S. the shots were disgusting.

When the waiter talks about the special 4 oz Wagyu NY strip but fails to mention its $38 an ounce and you order 24 ounces without anybody complaining about the bill you know you're in Vegas. 
P.S. the steak was amazing.

When there is a table of 1 very attractive black chick, Asian chick and white chick eating nothing the whole time you're there but sitting in a prime middle booth waiting for customers you know you're in Vegas.
P.S. they were hookers.

P.S. the pop over is great.  The appetizers are just ok and overpriced.I hate Mcdonald's I go tto be really really Hungry to eat there but my kids like it. This location service is what u expect from Mikey D's, nothing more nothing less.Old school looking, looked slightly dead. Had about 2.5 tables going, mostly elderly people. Probably a lot of Old town Vegas locals who have been playing here for years. I do like how they have a seperate tournament room though. And the hall of fame portrait photo wall of all the famous poker players that had played there. A damn good amount of them have been there. That was a cool feature.= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =

Well, it's been 7 months since enjoying this India Garden here, so it was due time to whip back over & see how they're doing.  This is a nice, fairly large place with tables only, no booths, and an 18 item serving table, which is probably about average size for an Indian Buffet.

The Naan bread is tasty here, served hot with a little seasoning (& we were offered more of it).  The Daah Maharani lentil soup was good, too.  Overall, though, I thought the food was just ok this time.  Their Tandoori Chicken, for instance, was rather dry, tough, & low in flavor, in my opinion.  Also, the service was blah.  SO,

an "OK" place...  Lunch Buffet $9.99 includes hot Indian style tea.  Full bar available.So...the food was good, very good even, but I have some complaints.  I would like to preface this review with the fact that I was overly excited to try this place.  I would say my overall feeling about Nourish is that I felt as if I was being 'sold' on an idea...does that make sense?  I went for brunch and had the egg/avocado sandwich w/cheese ($10), a coffee ($3), a side of fruit ($6.5). and a cinnamon role to go ($6 for just one and rather small).  Most everything seemed overpriced, even for Scottsdale, and I felt I was being 'up sold' on everything I ordered.  They was even an add in fee for plant extract in water.  The atmosphere & service was nice, but when I asked the server the 'quality of their animal products' he wasn't sure.  I later went onto their website to check it out, and they do have very high quality animal products, although it would have been nice to know there.  All in all, it was good, but I don't think I will be going back.I have no idea how I stumbled into this place, I think I was just killing some time or so. But I am glad I did because its really a nice place even if the Mens section is the size of a book case. But everything in here is organic  and I would say its all good quality . The mens section has some really nice cologne that you cant get anywhere. There is obviously tons of women's stuff. This review will be shorter because I didnt sample any of the women's stuff but from the smell of the place I would say it smells like good quality to me!I have walked past the Storytelling Centre umpteen times and have always thought that would be a lovely cafe to sit in and watch the world go by in. It has a massive windowed front looking right onto the Royal Mile. Perfect for drifting off and staring into the distance.

 So, I decided one day I would give it a go. It was fine when I arrived, although I had barely sat down and was asked what I wanted. I felt a little rushed, especially when the waiter stood there whilst I had a look through the menu. To be fair to him I should have just said I wasn't ready, but I ended up going for  a cappuccino and a piece of millionaires shortbread. The coffee was perfectly pleasant, and the millionaires shortbread was sweet, crumbly and pretty nice. Almost as good as my mums but not quite.

Where this cafe fell down was the image I had in my head, and what it turned out to be. This may sound awful to some, but there ain't any point in beating about the bush. I came here for a quiet half an hour chillax. Did I get this? No. Why not?

Kids. When I first walked in there were about two families, that was fine. After sitting for about 10 minutes I swear the place being swamped by screaming, crying, shouting kids, and their mothers who were decidedly unimpressed at the lack of high chairs. I think I turned up just after/before some book reading for them. Needless to say I did not stay long after that, my head was starting to hurt. 

Moral of the story, next time I will double check what is going on in the actual centre before I turn up. The cake selection is wide, and very tempting. Good specials on the board and a fairly solid menu.I went here on Mother's day, and we ended up getting a reduced rate for mom ($3 bucks).....This helped offset the overall cost of admission, so I won't gripe too much about the price.  Just FYI - You can get discounted tickets if you purchase/print them on line.....

Yes, it IS expensive, but it is in a mall with numerous high-end shops, etc.  I think that if it were somewhere else, that the price of admission might be lower.

The tanks are very clean (especially the BIG one).  All the creatures looked pretty happy, so I guess they are doing something right over there.  There were a couple of dead jellyfish in one of the tanks.....The only "bad" thing I saw.

Lots of kids acting like kids.....A few times we got backed-up behind large groups of people - I can see how this would be a BIG issue on a busy day, but it was not too bad for us on a lazy sunday.

Yes, it is dark in some spots - I am sure somebody will fall & sue them one day.....LOL  The darkness does make it cool, though - Just watch your step!Nice club. I wish they had more tables and sittings outside.First night in Vegas and we were looking for a bite to eat in Caesar's Palace.  As we were checking out the menu, the Hostess mentioned they had Happy Hour at 9pm and it was half priced appetizers and drink discounts.  It was only 8:15 and we didn't mind waiting for food until 9.  So we explored for 45 mins and returned for happy hour.  For drinks, she ordered a vodka and cran and I got the Miller Lite.  At the end, our receipt had Absolut and cran, which is at a premium cost.  We were expecting them to give her just the house vodka and cran.  Oh well, you live and you learn.  

For the appetizers, we had the grilled cheese, sweet potato fries with garlic mayo, and the philly cheese steak sliders.  I would highly recommend the grilled cheese because this is the perfect comfort food.  The side of tomato cream dipping sauce was a very nice compliment to the sandwiches.  If you like garlic, then you will love the garlic mayo dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries.  I love garlic so the sauce was great to me, but some may find it too strong for their taste.  The sliders were okay.  Kind of dry.  It would have been nice to compliment it with a dipping sauce or maybe I could have used a condiment (ketchup, mustard, or mayo) to offset it.  

Highly recomment for happy hour as their prices were reasonable.  Not sure if I would go here and pay regular prices unless I'm in my drunken and hungry state after bar hopping/clubbing.  Service was ok.  Just saw the waitress when we ordered, when she dropped off our food and when she dropped off the check.  No follow-ups and none was really needed.  

Would I return:  Yes, for happy hour or if I'm drunk and stumbling out of Pure hungry and thirsty. 
Would I recommend:  Yes, for the same reasons above.Alright, already, the show goes on
All night 'til the morning, we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on...at MUNCHBAR! - Lupe Fiasco (the show goes on)

Located right next to PURE nightclub, this 24 hr joint is a life-saver for ppl staying at Caesars. Their jalepeno burger is really good, their fries are less than average, and their nachos are good for the first few bites then everything tastes the same. The fact that this place is open 24 hrs though is a huge plus and they have enough tvs for you to enjoy your favorite team.  

Food: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): 3.5 starsThis place was ideal for the late night munchies! All your greasy, fatty options you crave after a night of getting liquored up. Or a full bar included in case your not ready to grub.

The staff was very interactive and genuinely friendly. We couldn't decide on what kind of shots to get so our super cool server surprised us. We ended up with PB&J shots. Which btw, tasted dead-on...

Food:
Chili cheese nachos were friggin off the chain GOOD! These nachos are a nice portion, good to share and get full with at least another person, maybe two others.

Sweet potato fries were a hard miss. They serve them in some cute little bucket but it made the fries soggy and gross. Not even the dipping sauces could save this disaster. 

My friend ordered the grilled cheese bites and they were not aesthetically appetizing. Per my friend they were a little dry. 

Overall, it's a koo lil diner spot with a full bar (no ciroc btw) that's open late. The chili cheese nachos are a must and with 5 stars. I say 1 star for the nachos, 1 for the server and 1 for being open late.I was really hoping Teriyaki Time would be better than my initial expectations but that didn't quite happen. Based on the restaurant's name I figured to try the Chicken Teriyaki with Gyoza. Most of the bento box was about average, nothing too impressive but at the same time not horrible. However I have to say that the salad they gave me was quite disappointing since the dressing they used seemed kind of cheap based on the looks of it. I also wished that the portions would have been bigger especially considering the overall quality of the food.

To be fair, the lady working at the restaurant seemed nice based on first impression and it's right near campus so I'll give it a benefit of a doubt for those reasons only. It seems like a decent choice to get a meal if you happen to go to UNLV, just don't expect anything spectacular.After a recommendation from Rand H. my hubby & I came here Sunday night. The restaurant was very clean & had a nice layout. When we were 1st seated a male server took our drink order, then throughout the meal a female server took our plates. Both were very sweet. What did surprise me though were the bathrooms. The sink area was actually super clean but the stalls & toilets were VERY dirty. I just washed my hands & waited till we got home to use the restroom. 

There were quite a few buffet options to chose from, plus a salad bar & sushi station. The stand out items for us were: crab legs, mussels baked w/cheese on top, green beans in some sort of sauce, mini eggrolls, sausage w/mustard & salmon. For dessert we each had some tiny cakes (coconut & coffee flavored) & I got a piece of this apple turnover looking thing w/some vanilla ice cream on top. 

Total including tip was about $30. Fair price for a buffet & we would probably come again if we were in the mood for it.I expected quite a bit more from this place.  Let's start by saying that the facilities are absolutely stunning.  You walk down a hallway that is lined with wine rooms and sommelier quarters and flanked by private booths with stunning views.  It opens to a huge white tablecloth dining room with incredible 180 degree views.  They absolutely have that right.

I had the braised porkshank.  It was very good.  It was not amazing and it was not the best that I have ever had but it was very good.  One member of our party had the lamb.  He said that it was just ok.  It looked great and the presentation was really executed well.  The other had a filet.  I am not a fan of filet but that being said it was still very good.  He also said that he enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was prepared perfectly.  I di did not try it but the quinoa was raved about by the others at the table.

I think they have it right.  A beautiful dining room.  Really good food...not the best...  Prices were reasonable for the quality and experience.  I was there on business and would return on my next trip.  Not being from the area, if someone else had a suggestion that they thought would be better I would pass on orange sky and try that new place.Decent price
Quick service
Busy place, so it's difficult to find a table
food was interesting, I love Mexican and Korean, but together it's just not my cup of tea.  The food just seemed greasy albeit seasoned well
and NO scissors for the kimchiIn a similar bracket to H Samuel, Warren James offers a good range of jewellery for all age groups at affordable prices. They tend to be hot on the latest jewellery trends offering copies of more pricier brands but at cheaper prices, perfect for gifts and if, like me, you're not too kind to your jewellery and are prone to misplacing it. 

At the moment they have an extensive range of charms starting for as little as £6. This is perfect for children if you don't want to splash out on more expensive brands.We tried `Off the Strip' based upon it's high rating for Italian cuisine in the Las Vegas area. Even on a Saturday night, they cheerfully accepted our reservation for 2. I made mention that it was our anniversary. When we arrived there were just two tables available, both right by the kitchen. Not exactly a `romantic' location w/ all the kitchen crew noise and wait staff traffic.

The service was prompt and very personable. We both ordered the Caesars salad w/ our entree. I asked for a small side of marinara with the bread. I usually do this because I enjoy a dip of marinara with my bread, but more so on a first visit, it lets me evaluate a key ingredient for most of their offerings. We all have formed our own particular tastes when it comes to Italian, and mine was formed during my travels to Italy, in particular Southern Italy. For me their marinara was not bad, but a bit too salty w/ a just hint of tomato. Not that fresh tomato flavor I have grown to love, so I avoided their marinara offerings and went for a vodka sauce dish.

The salads are made to order, I know because we were just steps from the salad chef. The Caesar salad was too 'hot' for both of us. It overpowered all other ingredients. We were later told that it was due to the amount of garlic used. I suggested they try cutting back a bit to give all of the complex flavors of a Caesar salad the opportunity to shine.

Dinner was good (not great), but we were both pleased w/ out entrees. After dinner we were surprised w/ a complimentary slice of their famous cheesecake. It is not under rated. It was delicious and the highlight of our Off the Strip dining experience.

A Tip... I don't know what the Off the Strip corkage is, but if I were to return, I would bring my own favorite as their most marginal wines are in the $35 range w/ most anything decent at $60+.Since not eating any meat for a month now and I went in to try their veggie sandwich. It was ok I guess but the best place to get green waffles though..Its not my favorite spot for Vietnamese sandwiches in the area .. but it does the trick for being open 24/7. I absolutely love the coconut waffles and the location is pretty convenient.The prices are reasonable. Its more of a American Vietnamese sandwich spot then anything.Stayed here this past weekend. The hotel looks so cool from the outside, so I have always wanted to stay. We checked in at 245pm on Saturday, and we were quoted a 30 min wait for our room to be ready, which ended up being 5 minutes.  We were put in a junior suite, however, my reservation was for a deluxe suite. I'm not sure if they tried to put us there because we wouldn't notice, but I had to check to be sure. They "upgraded" us to a premium oasis suite, which sounds cool, but is really just a deluxe suite with a pool view. The location was cool, because it was right across the street from the hard rock. If you are going to a concert at the joint, like we did, you can walk right over. The rooms have modern decor, similar to cosmo in my opinion. 

Here is what was advertised and not provided: there was no iPod docking station, no rumor bath supplies, no adult channels.  I would have preferred to know there was no iPod docking station, because I would have brought my own. Also, there is no valet service on Sundays, which was part of the "resort fee". Also, the bathtub was not really clean, which made me not want to use it. There are no towel racks, so towels will not properly dry. The ice machine in building 3 did not work all weekend, closest working ice machine was in building 8. Also, they provide 2 drinking glasses, much smaller than a regular cup, but just bigger than a shot glass. 

Also, there are two flat screen TVs, but the living room tv is tiny, maybe twice the size of an iPad. Also, the air conditioning units are loud, so you will be sleeping in a warm, stuffy but quiet room, or a cool, super noisy room. 

Overall, it is a Cosmopiltan Room on a budget, away from the strip, but has its share of drawbacks.I'd give it a 3.5 stars. We went last night and had dinner. The pizza is brick oven. Thats a plus. It's not a coal fired pizza, so I understand the difference. The pizza was good. We got a large pepperoni. It was nice and greasy and had average tasting peperoni. The crust was crunch and chewy, witch you expect from a brick oven. I got a cheese steak. It was average at best, but at least they had cherry peppers. Usually I have to order a cheese steak and have to add my own sweets and hots (chopped cherry peppers). I read that they had a kids area, not true anymore. That was a disappointment. My wife had to take the kids outside to play for the 50 min wait. It all worked out. 

Bottom line: I'd eat there again for pizza. It was good but not Grimaldi's or  La Piazza al Forno. Better than Barro's or anyone else within close driving distance from Goodyear.Late review.
Decided to try this spot while in Vegas since another spot was closed on 4th of July.
Used the Yelp coupon for checking in.
My daughter LOVED the grilled cheese meal.  She's a picky eater when it comes to her sandwiches.Want in to give it a try, didn't hate it, but I've had better. I had beef pad thai and it was great. My boyfriend on the other hand, he had the seafood soup, as usual, when they brought it out, it seemed good , but had a really strong bay leaf smell, and when he went in for the scoop he saw there wasn't any shrimp, and the portion was smaller than others we've had. Other than that service was great and the restaurant had a nice ambiance.Burgers are pretty good here.  I had lower expectations since it was inside Harrah's, but they delivered a nicely cooked and prepared burger.  The problem was the service.  The waiter kept avoiding us and it must have been 20 minutes before he brought over our water and only wanted to take our drink orders.  I asked for the manager, who waited on us the rest of our meal.  Food took forever.  It kind of ruin a nice burger.  Not sure if I'll be back unless the service is improved.  But how am I suppose to know that?Fantastic that they were close to where I work, rushed over to pick up my lunch here.

I must say that 3stars is all that they're getting, they didn't quite live up to their 5* hype.  Straight to the food I ordered a fukuburger & jazz fries, rushed it back to the office & started devouring this beastly morsel. 

The patty was medium well, I enjoy having a little pink in my meat which melts in your mouth & that's where the fantasy stops, no explosion of flavors nothing exponential new that catches my palate, a very subdued burger which is completely fine just subtly boring possibly due to the hype around it.

The jazz fries on the other hand, were absolutely effin fanstastic, only that thick fries don't work too well combined with the gravy, its still pretty good. I would  definitely start having gravy with my fries.

In all honesty I wouldn't go out of my way to track this roach coach down for their burgers, I would however be compelled to chase them for their fries. odd...Standard Sandwich Offerings with that Government-Smell

SITREP

This is the kind of place you hit when you are working close by, have about 15-20 minutes to (literally) grab something fast, and probably actually consume it while back to your deposition or training.

But creative props for at least having a sense of humor for choosing a name that is befitting of the location and vibe of the surrounding professional environment.  It is a Courthouse afterall.

SETUP

This reminds me of the low-key delis & cafeterias I usually frequent at the Clay Street Center in Oakland, the California Highway Patrol Complex in Monterey Park, CA, and the Health & Human Services Cafeteria inside the Bateson Building in Downtown Sacramento.

* Non-Descript
* Near a central government plaza
* An array of pre-made sandwiches, beverages, chips, etc.
* But quick and inexpensive

THE LOWDOWN

A decent good "grab & go" establishment when you have little time to grab a quick lunch.I've been a member of several gyms over the years, and Pure Gym is best described as the place to exercise for the financially conscious. 

It's a cheap as chips gym for £17 a month, which doesn't dent your pocket as much as a typical gym membership at £40+ a month. However, you get what you pay for at Pure Gym. 

The basic facilities are absolutely fine. There's a large ladies' changing room, showers and a really well equipped gym. It's also large and despite it being monster busy over Jan I've never had a problem getting on a cardio machine. There are weights, spin bikes, mats and a wide range of cardio equipment to keep you busy. 

So for £17 if you're a loner gym bunny, it's pretty good value for money and just what you need. 

However, where this gym loses it for me is its complete lack of personality. The classes are quite poor (my abs class saw a bloke reading instructions from an iPhone while he watched us doing tummy exercises in an island of mats visible from the cross-trainers - not much effort there!), there's no chat from fellow gym members and it's all a little bit too goldfish-bowl-esque (no, I don't want the entire gym and passers-by outside to see me screw up yoga poses). 

So a solid three star effort. It does the job but don't expect anything extra!Now that I have attended, I have a better idea of how to better enjoy this festival in the future.  
We arrived right when the doors opened on Sunday.  It was busy, but well organized and traffic and the lines moved fast.  Though there were quite a few booths set up with jewelry and such, it all looked liked junk and wasn't much fun to browse.
The food looked good, but it was a little too warm to sit in the sun for long and the few tables in the shade filled up quickly.  If I came another year, I would rather come at night, grab a table and some wine and enjoy the music and people watching.
The pastries were delicious!  I was very happy with the great selection of desserts.This is a cute little place that's very clean. The sandwiches are good but a little overpriced, around $7.25 for sandwich and another $2.50 for side and drink. We got the chicken salad that came on a croissant.  There was a lot of employees in my opinion for such a small place, about 4 and two were kinda standing around staring at us when we were ordering... Kinda awkward. Would probably come back if on the area and try another sandwich, wouldn't go out of my way though.Great for a quick cup...
Really easy to get to...
After a journeyThe Blue Bean Coffee House is certainly one of the better places in Portobello to go for a quick bite to eat and a warm cup of coffee. With it being on the High Street, this place does not have the luxury of the peace and quiet that other coffee houses have which are located nearer the beach. However, when inside, you become less aware of the busy traffic.

The coffee house itself is quite small inside with a relaxing, laid back atmosphere. The coffee was not very expensive at all, and when I was looking around I found that this place offered a lot more than just your normal coffee. On top of a range of hot drinks, this place also offers small bites to eat including soup and small sandwiches. 

When I was in, the coffee House was not full, but was certainly getting busier when I left during the mid afternoon. 

A laid back atmosphere which is always nice when having a coffee.Grabbed dinner there with my boyfriend.  I was pretty excited bc I've walked by plenty of times and thought the space looked really cool.  I guess I just felt underwhelmed about the experience.  The bartender was a little less than friendly, although the cocktail was pretty good.  We were seated in a table in a semi crowded area near the hostess stand.  The menu seemed a little all over the place.  I understand they were going for an upscale comfort food theme from the fried chicken and waffle and the meatloaf sandwich on the menu.  I got the steak which seemed like a decent enough deal at $20 and my boyfriend got some kind of Vietnamese sandwich.  The steak portion was pretty skimpy, they kind of feathered it across the plate so it looks like more than it actually is.  The sandwich my boyfriend got was cold and the bread was hard and stale.  I'd save your money visit Natt Spil down the street for a better meal at about half the price.I appreciate the need to be trendy and local, but this place is all talk and not enough show considering the Yummy factor for a guy like me....

I've had much better food for the price in many establishes around the Capital. 
I do strongly appreciate how much they are supporting the surrounding Madison Area food (for that a solid 3 out of 5 stars), but I was a bit let down with the production of what I have received in my orders. 

The menu is unique for sure, finding some really cool Madison area alternative eating's, but just be ready to expect that your ordering unique so what they will be bringing you might now be up your ally if your similar to a country boy like me who wants a big old bar burger (grease me up!) loaded up. 
It's hard to screw up a cheeseburger, and I think they may have totally messed it up pretty bad the last time I was there. I'm just not a fan of an English Muffin as a bun for a burger. 

They are a popular place that does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait to be seated. but if your lucky, you will get to sit in a huge booth or nice table, definitely, a great date place with huge place windows over looking Madison at it's finest. 

I'm not trying to be negative about Graze, I'm just not into it as much as everyone else. I would still suggest to try it out. It has enough window appeal to draw anyone it.I hear Legends recently closed, was sold, and is being redone to re-open soon. Fingers crossed as North Scottsdale needs a good little neighborhood hole.Every time I decide to get lunch from M&S, I think I'm in for a treat, and then by the time I get here I've remembered that they don't make nearly as many different sandwiches as they used to and what they DO make is pretty... meh.  

They used to have great wraps, avocado sandwiches, brie and grape, tasty tastiness.  In the place of the tasty tastiness they have lots and lots and lots of pasta salad type things.  Now I realise I just listed avocado and brie as sandwich choices but have you SEEN the health information on those pasta salads??  They're like, 2/3 of your daily intake.  That's narsty.

Additionally, the lines in here can be incredible.  Points for the staff for dealing with it quickly, but man at lunch it's absolutely ridiculous.  

So... I'm just really not that keen on M&S anyway, but poor lunch selection paired with ridiculous lines makes this place 2 stars at lunch time and 3 stars the rest of the time.First time I tried this place I was blown away.  Had a $20 steak that tasted like a $50 steak.  The next time I took some friends and they all enjoyed their meals but I was let down by their burger.  Went again and ordered the steak and it took forever and was nowhere near as good as the first one.  Willing to give them another shot based on first experience.  I just hope they have their act together.went for full lunch and dessert w/ kids:
waffle fries A+
Chicken strips w/ 'paintbrush' for mustard and ketchup A-
Cobb salad - overdressed and chopped, nothing special C+
bacon/chicken on sticks - 4 pieces $7, tasty B-
Croquettes - 4 pieces $7, okay C+
onion rings - tower of 10ish $7, Weee! A-
   came w/ chocloate ranch sauce, meh C+
Penne pasta $14, meh C+
mac and cheese kids meal w/ syringe full of marinara B- for fun factor

The real reason we'll return in the future:
decadent desserts and drinks!
- 80s milkshake (no can for refill) $7  - A
- Frozen lemonade $4 - A
- fondue for sharing - A
- kids loved their 'mess', cakepan sized bowl of ice cream w/ own house choco sauce to pour over - came w/ mini spatulas to eat with - A
- kid loved his chocolate syringe - A

all this w/ tip ran family of 5 $150.00I would give the chocolate 5 stars and the regular food 2 stars, so I ended up with 3 for my overall review.  I got a butterscotch shake that was DIVINE!  When we were ordering our lunch food, the waitress boasts to us that she has never had complaints about the food ever.  That was a bad sign.  Turns out we were her "first ever" complaints.  Or so she said.  A few of us ordered the Max Brenner burger.  We requested medium when asked how we want them cooked.  I ended up with a super dry burger that was charred on the outside.  I should have shelled out the extra $2 for the kobe beef because my friend said that although hers was overcooked, it was still juicy.  Mine was completely devoid of juiciness.  The waitress did comp one of the burgers when my friend complained, but I can't imagine she would have comped them all, so I stayed silent.  I was so full from the shake that I didn't bother finishing my burger.  Also, the BBQ sauce is non-existant on the burger, so make sure to request extra.  So disappointing for a $15 burger!  I will only come back for the sweets when I return to Vegas.My husband and I shared a burger and dessert. The burger was pretty tasty though small and I enjoyed the waffle cut fries that came with it. For dessert we got a waffle that had chocolate sauce, rice krispies, bananas, and ice cream. It was pretty delicious but again a little on the small side considering the prices at this place. We were in a group of 6 and the service was a tad on the slow side too. All in all an okay place to go and if you're in a group they take reservations which is convenient. Coffee is decent and there is a bar and chocolate shop inside. Next time I think I'd stick to just fun drinks and dessert there rather than a meal.The food and everything were wonderfully delicious, but the service bothered me a lot. The person who seated us was really nice, but our waiter seemed really rude. He would just throw everything on the table, napkins, forks, spoons, the check. It seemed like he was having a tantrum yet trying to be nice for a good tip. The food here is extremely good to eat, I had the hazelnut strawberry crepe and a Oreo milkshake. I would go back again even if the service is horrible.Honestly, I don't know jack about Thai food. I eat it occasionally, but not frequently enough to pick up the nuances of specific dishes. So, take this review with a grain of salt. The wife and I got takeout the other night. It's a cute little place... clean, modern, but small. The red curry with chicken that my wife ordered was hot. Very hot... at least for her. She got a level 5 and couldn't finish it because it was so hot. She also ordered extra veggies which cost a dollar. I don't like spicy food so I went with a 2 for my yellow curry chicken dish. Perfect (lack of) heat for me. It was tasty but could have used more chicken. I'd go back to try other dishes.Shave ice (or ice shave if you're from hilo) is the perfect treat for the ridiculous Vegas heat. Ever since big island boba closed, I've had shave ice withdrawals. Its great to finally have a place that's also on my side of town. 
Their flavors were pretty unique, but they were out of about 8 things. I opted for wedding cake just out of curiosity. It was good but I wouldn't say that it tasted like wedding cake - I mainly tasted vanilla. Roomie got banana and strawberry - banana tasted like banana, strawberry was tart and we both didn't care for it. I guess I got too exited when ordering, because I totally forgot about adding condensed milk or ice cream. 
As another review mentioned, service wasn't awesome. Then again how happy would you be packed into a trailer in 100+ degrees? I put $20 on the counter right in front of her, which the wind blew away. Roomie had to chase it and luckily got it before it flew into the street, while the girl remarks "yeah that happens a lot." If she knows that happens a lot, why not grab my damn money right away? 
I also thought they were kind of stingy with the syrup. You get a straw and everywhere else I've had shave ice, you drink the combined syrup on the bottom. Even at the end, standing in 100 degree heat, there was nothing to slurp up. As a kid, that was my fav part so I was a little bummed. 
I'll definitely go again but maybe I'll pay with quarters next time.Same cashier, same experience. I was offered a free meal from their awesome Yelp team, which I told them I would use today. Well the cashier didn't know what I was talking about and gave me $6.99 off (my meal was more then that). I brought my dog so I was going to sit outside, the chairs were still chained so you could sit on them but not comfortably use the table. This is a nice neighborhood I don't see why they need to be chained during business hours. Seems excessive. Never seen anyone sit on them and now I know why. I got it to go and won't be back.

I did appreciate their Yelp teams awesome customer service but that has to transfer over into service in the restaurant.Cool concept.  Hopefully it invigorates Downtown Phoenix nightlife.Spirit is OK. Like other reviewers have said, you need to prepare yourself for a flight, otherwise you WILL be caught by surprise by hidden fees. The key to this is reading their contract of carriage. Yes, it's like 900+ pages, but be aware of the fees and charges and you can indeed get a very cheap flight with them. 

I have flown back and forth a few times from Boston to Myrtle Beach for as little as $90 for my wife and myself. More typically, we do check a single bag, and end up paying around $160 or so RT for the two of us. 

We let the airline select our seat (it's an hour and a half flight, who cares?) and make sure to print boarding passes ahead of time. My wife and I have never not sat next to each other even with assigned seats. Double check your carry on items fit into the small personal item container. And you are OK. 

Yet, every single time I fly I see someone at the gate freaking out over a $40 checked bag fee. While I do feel bad that they were surprised by these costs, they aren't hidden. 

Finally; don't make any assumptions about what is free or not on Spirit Airlines. I wouldn't be surprised if they hooked up a mask to you to measure how much oxygen you use and charge for that. They key is research and making sure you are aware of what those fees are. 

Chances are, once you calculated it all out, you will still save a ton of money vs. flying another airline. It's just more of an aggravation to get there. 

Pros: Cheapest flights around, even after fees, if you plan for it. 
Cons: Requires hours of research to ensure you don't get charged extra for things; flights are often delayed or late.I have never used "ghetto" in any of my past reviews, but I was quite sure I would be plastering all over this one.

We were originally booked on another airline, but due to a mechanical failure our flight was either going to be delayed several hours or cancelled. These things happen and I really wont hold against that red tailed airline, as I would rather arrive safe than not at all.

It was the last flight of the night and we just wanted to get home and our options were limited. The customer service agent then suggested we head over to the Spirit counter.

No, really.

I've heard all the horror stories how this airline charges for everything from carry on baggage to peanuts. But it was literally the only option. 

Amazingly there was no line at the ticket counter. I told the customer service rep the deal and in turn he gave me the low down. He did an excellent job explaining each and every additional charge and broke everything down right down to the amount they charge for fuel (pretty much all airlines charge for fuel, you just didn't know that). My last question before committing. 

"hey, leg room is essential can we book aisle seats?"

Unfortunately all the aisles were already taken, but the agent then told us for an additional $75 we could book what they call the "Big Seat".

What the hay, we want to get home and even though the flight would take us to Oakland and not SFO it was worth the risk and maybe might even score a Yelp review out of it.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by said "Big Seat". It was pretty much like any other domestic Business Class seat on most any other airline, minus the pitch. The airplane itself was new and not at all smelly like I had expected. The service in the air was again good but not great then again it was only an hour plus flight. The overhead compartments were large enough to easily fit our carryons.

You probably wont find me switching my allegiance to Spirit. But I must say this, for what they advertise they are. That is exactly what you get.

We got Spirit yes we do!Before Jaiho I had never had Indian food and I must say it was not bad. This is not a put down to the restaurant, I just have no previous experiences to judge this against. 
This place is a self described Indian/Chinese fusion joint and it is that, from the food to the decor of the restaurant. It is a nice mix of both cultures. 
The food: I had the Garlic Paneer Chicken and it was not too bad. The sauce was a little too thick for my taste and I asked for hot (spicy) and expected my face to be on fire. But there was hardly any heat. A little disappointed.
My wife had chicken curry which was just average. We had an order of Samosas for an appetizer which was good and tasty. 
If we are in need of Indian food right away and in the area we will stop in again.I loved the pizza but the service is horrible.  I keep going back for the pizza but every time I go I am disappointed with the service.Hi my name is Katie, and I have a cupcake addiction. To date, my favorite cupcakes have been 1) Hey Cupcake in Austin, TX, 2) Cupcakes Couture Manhattan Beach, CA. I'm still searching for my favorite cupcakery in my home state of Arizona, but until I find something I like more; I was ecstatic to find Cupcake by Design just down the highway from my house. 

This isn't the first time I've paid $3.50 for a cupcake (decorative cupcakes are $4), and I liked some things about different cakes we tried.  This is the first time I haven't seen a discount when you buy a half dozen ($21). Mini's are available for pre-order at $2 a mini.


The flavors we tried were my signature Red Velvet (red velvet cake, cream cheese filled, with cream cheese frosting), Devil's Delight (Devil's food cake, filled with bavarian cream, and fudge icing), Love My Peanut Butter (peanut butter cake, fudge filled, peanut buyer cream icing), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup (Devil's food cake, peanut butter filled, chocolate peanut butter icing).

The red velvet had a pretty deep red color, and a moist cake, but I liked the cream cheese filling (which there could have been more of!) better than the cream cheese icing, which was just a little too sugary. The Devil's Delight was skimpy on the bavarian cream, but had a delicious devil's food flavor and a the fudge icing was a nice balance. This one I ate in the shop, and the owner even had complimentary water and coffee set out for patrons who decided to enjoy her deliciousness before they even left the store. It was a nice touch, and reinforced what a great neighborhood feel you can find in the Uptown area.

The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup had what seemed like solid peanut butter in the center, and was tasty when you distributed it between bites. If not, you may look a little like Mr. Ed as you eat this tasty cake. I probably should have had the Love my Peanut Butter before the chocolate peanut butter, because I totally lost the peanut butter flavor in the second cupcake. Some of this could be as a result of by tastebuds still lingering in the strong chocolatey peanut buttery goodness from the cake before. And if you're thinking, wait, did this chick really eat 4 cupcakes? Yes and no. I brought them to a friend's house and we cut them up and all had tastes of each one and shared our thoughts.

Final verdict: Would I go back for more? Yes. Is my search over for the perfect cupcakery in AZ? No, I will still be on the lookout for a replacement. Until then, I have found a tasty place for my tastebuds to flirt until I find "the one."

To view the other cupcakeries I've tried across the US, visit:
http://eatinganddrinkingacrosstheusa.blogspot.comCompared to a typical Indian grocery store, This place is very clean and organized. All the isles are properly marked and doesn't smell like a Temple(mixed smell of about 5 mil incense sticks)

Kitchen looks very clean and some great items on the menu with close to homemade taste. Their inhouse sweets are just ok but they are fresh, not frozen for a week shipped from NY or Chcago.

My only issue here is service. The lady at the front cash register is so rude, I don't even go inside the store because if her. Absolutely no greeting, no smile and if you ask her a question, lets just say you'll regret it.

EDIT: Service has somewhat improved and I feel the review should be changed a bit. Changing from 1 start to 3 till my next visit. Keep up the good work.

Anyways, here are my very accurate ratings

Cleanliness 9.5/10
Organized 9/10
Variety 8.5/10
Food/Kitchen 7/10
Service 5/10
Location/Parking 7/10Interesting that this is a small chain.  This location has a 4 star rating and the Chandler Blvd. and 16th St. locations have only 3 1/2 stars.

I wanted to hate this place after ordering.  I thought the prices were quite high for a counter service middle eastern style restaurant.  It took FOREVER to get our food and I was so hungry.  I was close to asking for my money back and leaving.

Then the food came.  My girls loved the stuffed grape leaves.  The falafel wasn't the best ever but it was pretty good.  My husband ate all of his chicken and rice and salad.  The eggplant dip was what really shocked me.  I wasn't sure I liked it with the cream sauce on top but the more I ate the more I loved it.  The flatbread was good also.

I likely won't go back as I just adore Haji Baba (Tempe) when I am in the mood for this type of food but it wasn't bad if you are in the area.La struttura non è nuovissima ma è pulita e funzionale. Si trova poco distante dalla Strip e con un costo molto contenuto (circa 34$ a notte per una stanza con doppio Queen Size Bed) non si può chiedere molto di più.
Il personale in reception è cordiale e disponibile. 
Piscina e jacuzzi sebbene piccole fanno molto piacere per rilassarsi dopo una giornata in giro con temperature al di sopra dei 40°...
Il WiFi copre tutta la struttura e funziona bene, il parcheggio ha un costo di 3$ a notte.I'm staying at the hotel right next to this bar so it's really convenient if I just wanna go down and get a beer. They whole layout of the bar is a little interesting and I can't say it's really conducive to the bar's success, but I'm not Jon Taffer, so what do I know?
It's just your basic bar w/ pool tables, TV's, food, and some games--nothing special.The food seems the same as when it was the Griddle. Not bad Not amazing. Pancakes are big ! The biscuit and gravy woulda been better if the biscuit wasn't hard. One thing that bothered me was the setup of the tables and being in a busy walkway . And there felt like there were sooo many workers working that had nothing to do. I felt smothered every few minutes ..I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! 

They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!

The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. 

The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. 

The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!The location of this Five Guys was great, as it was right downtown amidst many other great places. The service was splendid. The food was good; it was better than a normal fast-food burger, but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The cajun fries are great; you get well beyond the price you pay in fries. I got a "little fry" that I was told "feeds one person". I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello. 

Overall, the food was great but not worth the price I paid. Would I go back? Sure, but not often. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes, but with an indication of the prices.Love the concept. Born and raised is owned by locals who were actually born and raised in Las Vegas which i can appreciate because i was too. If you also are from here you can bring in your birth certificate and you will receive 10% off your bill forever. Awesome. Great ambiance, love all the unique chairs and TVs galore. Decent prices and pretty good food. Cant complain about the over all place. 
Whats the deal with only 3 stars? The service is beyond horrible. It doesn't matter what time of day or how busy it is the bartenders always look like they want to kill someone. Being a bartender myself I notice the little things and I hate sitting at a bar when I'm paying and tipping (usually at least 30%) and I'm treated as if I'm annoying them by asking for drinks/etc. 
I continue going back because like i said i love the ambiance and the idea of people being from Las Vegas. And its convenient :)I think for the price this food was reasonable but I wasn't exactly impressed.  It was good but my date and myself agreed that the noodles weren't as good as we had eaten at other places.  I don't think that it is fair to give it a bad review but I also thought that the menu was kind of hard to understand.  Maybe it was because it was my first time there but it wasn't really straight forward to me.  Service was standard, nothing out of the ordinary.Our experience at Otto's was mixed. They brought the breadsticks that are imported from Italy. We ask for bread, which came with no butter or oil. They brought oil after we ask. I has the braised pork shoulder and would give it a five. The apple reduction was out of this world. My wife had spaghetti with pepper and butter. It was just average. I ordered Lemoncello and it was terrible. I sent back and the waiter said the bar tender did not shake it up. The second glass was better, but still not good. I would not recommend. We share the three flavored of Gelato and we only found two favors and they were just OK, again I wouldn't reorder.
Our service was good. The prices were high, but for what I have seen of Las Vegas, they were about right.Came back recently to get more of their bomb Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings and noticed that they also have a spicy version.  I opted to go with my old fav, and it did not disappoint.  I also ordered the Curry Chicken over Rice (you can also have it over noodles instead), and the curry was good.  However, the larger pieces of chicken were slightly undercooked, just the way the French Chefs like their poultry. 

If you need to brush up on your Chinese, drop in and watch some TV while you wait for your take out order or while you eat.Here in the former shell of Red Dragon nee Daily Buffet comes the new China House Buffet, & I stopped in to give it a try today, having been alerted to it by friend Alexander C. just yesterday.  All of the charming, funky old '50s atmosphere is gone, as is the Mexican buffet table, & in it's place we have a two sterile, completely blah rooms, with the old booths still in place, but with everything else (like the important room dividers) gone!    :-O

For food, this is strictly a Chinese buffet now, & the new owners had 44 food choices out today, plus dressings & sauces.  The food is different than it used to be, it was good, & certain things were special, including fresh papaya, & the broiled chicken.  It's also the same reasonable price as it was before, & the Hostess/Server/Cashier lady was nice.

I overheard another customer ask her friend what she thought of the change, & her friend replied, "I'm sad.  I'm in mourning."

Me too. 

Lunch Buffet $6.29/$5.66 Sr.Well I went here twice during the week for lunch but I admit it was mostly because of the patio.  Great location, very central on the strip and easy to meet friends at.

The first time I felt screwed by the waitress as she kept bringing buckets of beer, and I don't think anyone was asking for it.  She was also assuming the previous order was the same s the next order which wasn't the case because some of the guys were leaving. long story short, we ended up leaving behind four full beers that we paid for, but didn't order.

The second time I went was great.  I can't complain. And it was very relaxing.  The food is typical bar food, no big deal, but it is such a nice way to chill when you've been walking around all morning.Cave Creek is certainly not a foodie's paradise.  Old town CC is a tourist trap, and Scottsdale Road offers very little.  

In the residential area of Tatum Ranch where thousands of husband, wife, plus two kids abound, Amaro's is the only real dining experience that is accessible.  

And thank goodness it delivers.  

The interior is a bit flawed.  They could benefit from having an interior decorator redesign the dining room entirely so it doesn't feel like a recycled restaurant that spent a little money on a paint job and some re-upholstering.  The space just feels weird.  

But, the cuisine benefits from the fact that you will be hard pressed to find a worthy competitor within shouting distance.  

The pizza is actually very very good.  The crust is top notch and their red sauce is bright and fresh.  

The Caesar comes up short, with not nearly enough dressing.  It coulda been a contendah...

They do this cool thing with kids where they give out small samples of dough to play around with while awaiting the food.  

All in all, this restaurant stands out because it is:
- good quality food
- the only choice in the neighborhoodHad the ham and cheese and it was good but definitely not worth the nearly $7 I paid. As with most sub places, you get one tiny piece of cheese that you can't even taste. Skipping it saves a few calories!

I also got mustard and mayo, which meant my sandwich was now swimming in mustard and mayo. Next time I will ask for light mustard and mayo. 

Will go back, maybe if we get a gift card :)I am so thankful there is 24 hr places around town in case you want something at your convienence!Had a groupon and had to try this place out. Jake was our server and he was excellent. We were very pleased, spouse had a ribeye, was a little fatty but good. I had king crab legs, good but I've had better. Cocktails were excellent too.The Red Velvet pancakes was good Not Great like everyone Hype it up to be. Don't like that they close so early. Not everyone can get up so early in the day. People work all different hours in Vegas.This place was just OK. Nothing to rave home about. I didn't think it was any worse or any better than other froyo places I have been to.The food was good and the portions are gigantic! Two can share one plate. Three stars because the service was pretty bad which is a shame. My lil 9 year old bro ordered a kids burger and they brought it out after being reminded and when everyone else was pretty much done eating. I felt embarrassed for the waitress when he told her " how hard is it to make a burger?"  But the food was good.Very yummy tacos. They were pretty small but you can get 3 for $9 so that's not too bad. Unlike other food trucks, they don't make the food to order in the truck. The meat are roasted ahead of time and then they just put it on the tacos with the toppings and salsas you desire. The pork and beef tasted great but I'm not sure I'd do fish that way.Great, great coffee. I haven't tried the crepes but from what I've heard they are good. My hesitancy with giving it 4 or 5 stars is the cleanliness or lack there of. I like the local charm , but the owner should look to spruce things up  bitFish tacos are not good.I would love to see this bar succeed.  I think a couple of things I feel they could do better.  

A couple of criticisms -  
Food:  Flatten out the chicken for the chicken sandwich.  Makes it a lot easier to eat and stays on the roll better.  

Service/Waitstaff:  Although I think the service is over all good.  They aren't that exciting.  Often times I go in there and other than my order, I literally say 3 words to the bartender.  It's the bartenders job to keep people coming back.  They need to strike up conversations to make the visitor feel that they are important and create a fun atmosphere.  Also you will never get the night crowd if most of your waitstaff at night are men.  It's sexist to say it I know, but this is reality.  Zipps is crowded for a reason.  It's not that they have the best food in the world but they have a nice looking waitstaff.  

Atmosphere:  That Jukebox needs, I stress NEEDS to be on at all times. Music is the key to conversations, mood, and attitude.  Without it, it will suck the life out of your bar.  One of my visits there were with 3 people at the bar and no music playing.  No one was talking. No one looked happy.  I threw in a couple of dollars in the jukebox and saw a transformation that you wouldn't believe unless you were there.  All of a sudden you have people talking, laughing and when other people came in you could instantly see them digging the vibe.   Flanny's is pretty big concrete and airy.  Meaning there isn't much to deaden the sound.  So if there isn't any music playing it's awkwardly silent and all you hear is a sports game on the speakers.  I guess you could say, well put some money in the jukebox then.  Most people are not confident enough to be that first person to enter in their song selection.  So in reality by not having the jukebox playing you are actually losing commissions on your jukebox sales.  Assuming they are getting commissions.  Either way people will leave when they are bored.

I will keep going back to Flanny's for sure. But it would be nice to see them continue to listen to their visitors.I jumped out of a plane once so going zip lining was not hard at all. Only thing hard was the harness being strapped so tight leaving my balls scrunched up and allowing my Ass to consume my boxers. Talk about major wedgie! 

Went in. Stepped on the scale. (147lbs of lean muscle! ) Put my initials on some form(maybe I should've read it.... ) paid the 15 bucks and I was good to go. 

First time going zip lining so that was exciting. 30 secs of excitement, not so exciting. (That's what she said... oh wait what!?? ) Ride was over as soon as it started.  I ended up riding backwards so I could not see where I was headed.  Next thing you know, I'm stopped with some force. End of the ride buddy. 

Wasn't the greatest but I guess it's not the worse zip line ride in the world. Imagine having to do this everyday.....

This is one of those Vegas experiences you need to try at least ONCE. (along with all those other experiences that they say should stay in Vegas!)Maybe it was an off day we visited. The food, particularly the noodles was not authentic to me, some dishes from another take-out place. Cold appetizer dishes are excellent. Service is great.So I have a friend who loves this place so we decided go.
SERVICE:We were seated right away but waited awhile before we go any service. The hostess came back and took our drink order. Eventually the server came out, had no idea about our drinks and we ended up waiting awhile for them. We were still waiting for one more person so I guess the server figured she wouldn't check back until the last person was there. So finally our drinks come out and we rush to tell her about our appetizer. But even when the last person joined us, the service still moved slowly. 
FOOD AND DRINKS- we had margaritas. The white peach and guava margaritas were awesome! We also had the blood orange which I found to be a little too bitter for me. We started with the buffalo nachos which were good. I really liked the queso sauce they used. I had the fajita salad: the meat was well seasoned but there was too much dressing which made everything soggy :(
My friends had the daddy's cob salad and their vegetarian mango tacos. Both were really good.I went here with the family for some "amazing" nachos as advertised. The ambiance is that of a bar, with additional tables for families. TVs everywhere and the place is LOUD. We ordered the cheeseburger nachos and the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and we did not have to wait for drinks or refills.

When the food came out I was a little surprised. A large pile of nachos covered in about everything you can think of. The cheeseburger nachos were really quite good, even my picky 7 year old liked them. The plating is something to be desired, on an oval skillet-type platter that is too small for the amount of food, and many a nacho ended up in the laps of my kids. The BBQ pulled pork nachos were not that great, but only because it was WAY too much. You need a gallon of water to swallow five bites, and the BBQ sauce and cheese are overwhelming to the palate.

Overall, not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again if I absolutely had to.Came here one night because "In-N-Out" was PACKED(like always)! The place was empty and the owner was maning the restaurants FOH by himself. I told him I wanted an order "to go" and he gave me some recommendations. One of the suggestions was his slow cooked Brisket, which was the best out of all we ordered, and amazing to any standards. Tender, full of flavor, and definitely left a great, lasting impression. 

When going over what I wanted to order, he tried to stray me away from some of the options, which was a bit odd, but I was starving and didn't care. I should have listened. The chicken he tried steering us away from was DRY and the sauce for it didn't compliment or help it go down one bit. By far, the Brisket was the best choice and would go back solely for that one item. 

Our food was ready in almost no time, and the bill was pretty inexpensive. I caught some quick glimpses of the dining room, and it wasn't anything exciting. Next time I go i'll have to sit in and get the full experience.Found it okay okay. The menu items were more or less what you expect from a Thai place.This was my 2nd time eating here, both times were for take out.  The setup is a little strange when you walk in but it's to be expected I supposed when they converted an old Wendy's drive through (pretty sure it was Wendy's). Anyways, this trip I ordered the tom yum soup and papaya salad.  The soup was eh, mediocre at best.  Tom yum should be a clear hot and sour soup, should be spicy but this was very thick with chili, hard to describe but I only ate half of the small or bowl size serving because it wasn't very good.  The green papaya salad is definitely NOT authentic in flavor but I found it strangely addictive. It almost had a parmesan cheesey flavor to the dressing, I really hope there wasn't any cheese in there but it's the best way I can describe it. I would only order this again if I wasn't wanting a normal salad, but it tasted nothing like an authentic green papaya salad should.Very comfortable way to get out of the AZ heat.  Not so happy that for some reason we had an upcharge of $2 to see "Bridesmaids".  I'm still not clear why there was an upcharge...but since I guess I have no choice...fine, whatever.  

Seats are really comfortable, and not too close to each other.  I sat in it thinking it should really recline and that would make it even better.  Popcorn was good, but I love all movie popcorn.  Paid 600% markup on bottled water, as usual at a movie theater.  I really need to start smuggling drinks in with me.I like this place.  I really do.  But I like hot dogs and popcorn when I go to the movies, too.  The seats are comfortable, the place is clean and there's lots of theatres.  The problem:  every time I go to get a hot dog it's more like a Slim Jim.  They're hard and overcooked and it forces me to have them make me a fresh one which takes lots of time.  And the popcorn is almost always stale.  If they could get those two things right, this place would get five stars from me.Great atmosphere. Great service. Good prices. Massages were very routine but not bad. Staff was very gracious, so that left a good feeling for me. I was hoping for a better massage on my feet, so for a foot spa, it left something to be desired. Giving 3 stars for the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff.The spa is definitely worth it, $22/hr! Its not the cleanest but the massage was good; you get what you pay for. Do not have high expectations here**

The spa is a large room with semi private open rooms in it, where you can hear everything from the room next door. The bathrooms are not the cleanest so if you dont have to go, just wait. 
They greet you with a large bucket of warm water with a plastic bag wrapped around it to soak your feet in. When the man massaged my feet he applied just the right pressure, very relaxing. 

Overall, I would go again! It's worth the price; I will just use the bathroom before going inside.There are times when people have referred to another person's review and said, "So-and-So said it all, I really have nothing to add." 

Well, in this case, it is literally literal. 

Daren C said pretty much what I would have said, as far as an objective description of the place and what went down.

However, I have to part from my wise brother in my rating. Although I believe we felt the same about the fact that the meat had a really good, smokey flavor, it was too greasy for me to enjoy that flavor. The bottom of the bun sponged up so much that it was soaked, and a light squeeze produced a stream and puddle. Eww. 

The meat and sauce had good flavor, so there's potential, but the grease just overpowered it so much, and I fear the repercussions that may be to come.Ive been told this place is like Smashburger.  I gotta tell ya.  I like Smashburger better.   Not to say this place isn't good.  it was delicious, really it was.  But for me it was just another burger with fries and nothing that amazing.

Would I go again? Sure..  but only if friends wanted to go and I didn't feel like whining about going somewhere else. 

Do get their cheese curds.  Those were yummy.french toast was good and the scramble was good but overall it was good but nothing to tweet about, wait staff was friendly but get here early it gets packedFriendly advice to the ladies - don't come here if you plan on going to the clubs after .. you probably won't fit into your dress.

On the brighter side, the burgers and appetizers are derrish. The fried pickles and kimchee quesadilla (large portioned enough to be an entree) is a must try. Oh, and lets not forget the bull-gogi burger (add cheddar cheese).

 However, the famous lobster mac&cheese is up for debate. It was served cold, watery, and rarely any lobster pieces. Bummer..

Lastly, the service lacks and you wait so long for your food, you start seeing stars.Trendy, overrated.

I had the Gold Standard with sweet potato fries. I had a Sam Adams Octoberfest and Franziskaner Hefe Weisse.

Burger was definitely good, but not a whole lot better than a burger you get from any ol' pub. It really wasn't that special.  Sweet potato fries also good, but again nothing special. 

Tourists and people who don't know any better will rate this place highly.

Very good, but far from "must try."  If you want an overpriced burger, it's not bad.See my post on Bachi Burger. In a nutshell, this place is overhyped in my opinion. Food is good but not worth the price. Adult shakes were probably the best thing here.Note: this review pertains to their reverse happy hour.

The Skinny: Truly the food here is comme ci, comme ca (as the French say "so-so") (3), service: friendly and pretty efficient (3), value: holy smokes, the serving sizes here are ridiculously large. For the quality and quantity, it's a good value even though there are issues with execution(3.5).

We came here because of their excellent deal on their reverse happy hour (1/2 price on their bar menu which starts at 10 pm). We ordered the Comme ca burger, the Provence Country Salad, the Charcuterie plate and the Roasted Bone Marrow with oxtail jam.

I want to say something to start - the serving sizes are massive, certainly worth every penny on that criteria alone. Our order could have easily fed 4 more people. The salad came in a large bowl the size of a small washbasin. My hubby couldn't even get his mouth around the burger (trust me, it's a rare thing). 

Normally that would be a great thing if the food was good. Unfortunately, due to execution issues, it just doesn't make the cut.

The much lauded Comme Ca burger was a huge disappointment. Sporting a thicker good quality patty, the beef was terribly underseasoned (ie, lacking enough salt for one). The addition of a rather goopy, oddly sour slaw on top of the already bland meat added insult on top of injury. The fries were lackluster texturally (not crispy!) although the garlic aioli was okay.

The bone marrow with fleur de sel was great - very rich and decadent. However the accompanying oxtail jam was overly salty.  Definitely stuck between a rock and a hard place with the bread - you need bread to mellow out the richness of the bone marrow, but the bread you're served is a dentist's wet dream (ie, too hard by far).

The charcuterie plate was faired better  - a large serving of interesting rich house pates and meats.However, it was again served with that terrible bread which definitely a big minus in my book.

Finally, the salad. The salad was large and filling. There was perhaps a little too much acidity with the dressing and could have used a tinge more sweetness to mellow it out.

I am definitely conflicted about the meal at Comme Ca. On the one hand, it's a fantastic deal given the portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients. But on the other, execution issues mar the value of the coming here. Overall, it evens out to a three starred review.The view is great. The food is pretty good.. We had a groupon and got the french onion soup and steak frites. The soup was far too sweet, I didn't like it at all. The fries were amazing!! And their garlic dip they served with it was awesome too. The steak however tasted like a cheap cut to me, and it was slightly over cooked because I ordered it medium rare. The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted them to throw on a new one without me even asking - but I didn't feel like waiting or doing that to the kitchen so I just dealt with it. So the service is good!! The cocktails were pretty good but very pricey. Ouch!! Strip pricing of course. The bread and butter was awesome but I don't think I would go back. With our groupon we still spent $130 - ouch!! It probably would have cost the same price without it.Stumbled upon Merchant and thought it looked stylish & trendy. Good atmosphere with reasonably priced, strong drinks. Very busy on a Friday night.

At 10pm, DJ took over playing great 80's & 90's music. Lots of college kids getting their groove on.  Enjoyed people watching!

Really fun time, but skip the shrimp tacos. :)Everytime I passed by this place there was always a big line of people out front (appx 30 minute wait), so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was tasty and cheap, but keep in mind you get what you pay for... It was good though the portions were small. It was decorated cute and the waitress was such a sweet heart. I may return if the lines ever start to die down, I don't wait for food.A 3 1/2 stars to be more precise.

Be prepared...be very prepared...for a friggin' long line!  Especially on weekends!  Line seems to always be out the door and the tables crammed with diners.  It's like being in like for Black Friday!  Thank goodness it's in the middle of the South Point casino close to the sports book instead in the freezing desert!  It does get kind of ridiculous.
We were in line for a good 45 minutes before being seated.

The inside is cool, very reminiscent of old 70's diners with the nostalgia feel.  Like the red, white and chrome all around...almost like a classic tricked out lil' GTO!  But enough about the ambiance, let's get to the food!

Honestly, I've had a better burger.  I was kinda expecting to be WOW!  But it was more of a, uh...wow.  Got my balloon a little deflated there.  The shakes are fatty good, and the burgers are A-OK but overall I was just...OK.  This is what I wasted all my time and gas for?  An OK burger.  Not disappointed, but not 'I gotta eat here every week' either.  For what it was it was pretty good.  Decent food for decent prices.  With the line outside always there you would figure this place gave out free kisses from pre-Seal Heidi Klum (yes, for arguments sake she was way hotter back then).

The menu was good and the prices were very reasonable, especially the 4 meals under $4 each that caught my eye.  This is what I stuck with since it was our first time there.  Your 4 choices were:  a bacon cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a triple burger (no cheese), and chicken fingers.  Each meal was served with thin-cut fries.  The fries were awesome (ask for em' cooked well) with lots of ketchup.  My double cheeseburger?  Meh, it was ok.  I mean, seriously...WHERE'S THE BEEF?  My lack of 'steak' made my head 'shake'.  No quarter pounder here?  I loved the charred edges but damn, no juicy beef in the middle?  So of course, my burger ended up a little on the dry side.  There was no re-creation of a Carl's Jr. sloppy burger commercial with Kate Upton in little clothing.  It left me a bit disappointed.

The shakes are great though (but cost almost as much as a burger).  The cookies and cream one was a fav of mine.  But not for my hips, my glorious hips!  They are definitely on the full flavor side...the shakes, not my hips.

The service was good but very rushed, you get the feeling like they want you to order, enjoy your meal quickly, then pay and leave for the next folks in the gargantuan line.  I would come here again, but only if I was already on that side of town and it was late night.This place isn't bad! My friend works here so I decided to come in and visit. The staff is friendly and helpful. Burgers are good, but I feel like they're a little too expensive. I'd probably go back - but with my parents so I wouldn't have to pay for anything (haha). The tater tots are good, but saaaaalty which was kinda lame. I wanna try some of the other burgers since the last time I went I just got a standard burger. I had a bite of the salmon burger though and it was pretty good. 
However I will say this: nothing compares to a burger from the Counter. If I had to choose between this place and the Counter, I would still choose the Counter. 
I do like that they have free wifi though!I think that this buffet has a good idea/style, but the food doesn't live up to the name of the hotel. 

First of all, I think this hotel has a horrible system because of the fact that they have you pay in one area, and wait to get seated in another. Since you're paying first, you are tipping for service that you haven't received. That was my biggest thing.

A lot of people have brought up that this buffet provides a lot of choices, Asian, Italian, meat carving, salads, and a mac and cheese bar. They pre portion a lot of the food so theres less waste/people don't over grab the food they are providing. I think it has a really cute idea, but some of the portions are still too big. The quality of the food I would say was just average; I left this place with nothing to rave about.

The desert is a whole different story. Almost everything is edible! Cups of chocolate inside chocolate mousse with fresh fruit on top. They had a variety of bread pudding, gelato, and different types of pudding and baked goods.The best thing I had was the chocolate covered strawberries ( plain chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered strawberries with crushed oreos, and chocolate covered strawberries with toffee)

For the price ($35 for dinner) I was expecting a little more variety (sushi and salads), but it was definitely worth trying.3.5 rounded down.

I went to the Bacchanal first,  and the Wicked Spoon is no Bacchanal, but still quite good compared to most hotels around town (Did you know the one near the entrance of the Rio is actually quite good?). 

They have a decent selection of food - I actually really like their cheese selection and salad bar. There's even a make-your-own-macaroni section, and the dessert gelatos are more eccentric than other places. Also, the service was nice - the waitress was actually friendly, which is rare to encounter at any buffet.

I don't really remember the price tag, but it's cheaper than Bacchanal.Drove to Vegas for the weekend with my friends and got here Friday night. After checking in to our hotel and dropping off our bags, we decided to inaugurate our Vegas trip with dinner at Wicked Spoon because we had all heard pretty good reviews online and through friends that had been here before. We didn't get in too late (maybe around 9ish), but it was already pretty empty. I'm used to spending a bit of money for a good buffet at Vegas, but $50 was still a bit of a surprise to me. 

In terms of service, it's a buffet, so the most I expect is that someone come by to take our drinks order, keep the drinks refilled, and then clear the empty plates are necessary. I'm not a big drinker of liquids (especially at a buffet where the focus of all my stomach space is on food to consume), but my friends waited too long to have their water glasses refilled. I was also kind of taken aback that, for $50, we had to have more than 50% of our dishware traded out because there was still crusted on food from other people's meals still on our glasses, plates, and silverware. Um, ew. There was also a lot of plates in the buffet area that still had food coating on them. What is going on with their dishwashers??

In terms of the food: I usually like going to the carving station and getting the carved meats there. The prime rib was, imo, just "meh". The first cut I got was good, but the second cut was a bit dry and overdone. The chef manning the station looked like he was on something. He was away half the time, and at one point there was a crowd of people waiting, he opened the door from the back kitchen, looked at us, and then disappeared for another 5min. When he did come back, I asked for medium-rare, and he cut me whatever was there on hand (hint: it wasn't medium-rare). My friend really liked the marinated Korean short ribs, but I thought they were just average. The marinade was good, but I can get the same quality meat at my local Korean supermarket which also pre-marinades it for me. The bone marrow (first time I tried it) was delicious, if you could find any bones with the marrow cooked well enough. Not all of the bone marrow was cooked to the right consistency, and they didn't seem keen on refilling. The shepherd's pie was amazing and awesome. I loved that dish! The crab legs are pre-halved (always a plus for a Vegas buffet), and were also pretty delicious. I saw the mac n cheese station, but the line was too intense, so I passed on that... maybe next time if there is a next time. I did enjoy the various dessert options - varied, visually pleasing, and the flavors were pretty yum. 

Overall, I don't think that the food was terrible. In fact, when I could actually eat, the food was pretty decent. I'm just turned off that for $50 I had to deal with some really unappetizing dirty dishware and a head carver who was MIA more than half the time. Seriously, a lady in front of me thought maybe it was "self-serve". If I were to chance coming back here again I would need some heavy incentive to do so. Otherwise, there are some really yummy alternatives for less of the cost.After hearing only excellent things about Wicked Spoon, I knew that if I ate anything at all in Vegas, this had to be it. With this in mind, hours after stepping off the plane, we headed over to Wicked Spoon with high expectations and empty bellies. 

I guess it might have been a combination of things---perhaps the bar was set too high in my mind, maybe I should have reserved it for dinner rather than lunch, or perhaps it was just a bad day. I'm not sure. While the buffet wasn't terrible, I definitely don't think that it lives up to its hype. 

We paid around ~$30/pp for lunch on a Friday. This constitutes as weekday lunch, and prices get jacked up dinner and on the weekends. We also added about ~$8 for unlimited mimosas/champagne/bloody marys. Lines, as with most good buffets in Vegas, are to be expected. We spent about 20 minutes in line for the cashier, and then another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. 

Okayyy, so before we get to the nitty gritty of what I didn't like...  It's not completely negative around here, there are a few things that did stand out to me in a most positive light:
-Though I'm not too impressed by the small/individual portions because I found out the next day that Bacchanal Buffet does the same, BUT... I did love the little Chinese takeout boxes for the Asian food. SO. ADORABLE.
-Bone marrow was something that I had been told about beforehand, so I was looking forward to it. Though the sizes are a little bit smaller than what I expected (that day, anyways), the thought alone to include bone marrow in the buffet line is spectacular. Props for whoever thought of it!
-Eggs freakin' benedict---So good, and I could eat these all day! That and the cocktail shrimp, ohh yeeaaah, drop them off to my table by the bucket, please! 
-If bottomless drinks are ever even a question, my answer will ALWAYS, be yes! I was able to try all three that they offer, and my favorite by far has to be the mimosa. I have to say, it was pretty strong. They were pretty busy at the time, so our amazing waiter brought our drinks by the doubles---definitely brunching it, Vegas style! 

Now, I knew that the spread wouldn't be as big during lunch compared to dinner. But even with this in mind, I was kind of disappointed with the selections, aside from the two items I mentioned above. If I can't have seafood then the backup to my standby becomes the meats. The roast pork I had was mostly roasted fat. The pork loin I tried was beyond overcooked, and the running joke of lunch was that beef from the carving station was so hard it was almost like eating the ass part of the cow! I tried bits and pieces of other items on the buffet line, and while nothing was particularly bad, nothing blew my mind either---just like my star rating, it was just OK. Most stuff was standard buffet fare. Heavy on the starch items. No macarons that day too, boo! 

If you come here, do it for the mimosas and the eggs benedict. Do all you can to avoid the ass part of the beef!Decent GC, just like the others I suppose.  Went into the Platinum room and looked at a $24K Telecaster...don't see that every day.  Friendly staff offered to plug in guitars for me multiple times.Marquee is the new nightlife hot spot in Vegas right now. Word of Kanye, Jay-Z and some other celebs have already ventured through its doors. Suit up, throw some rubbers in your pockets, and prepare for a night of chaos. You may even get lucky by the end of the night.

Where does it begin? The lines to enter that is. Tables, guestlists, VIP, ticket holders, general admission. There are lines everywhere. If you're trying your luck in the regular line, look for the longest. It wraps longer than Dirk Diggler's goods and it is slower than your grandma's driving. Pre partying in line? You better make it quick. The men in black suits will jump on it if they see you boozing in line. Ultimatum given: kill your drink in front of him on the spot or toss it out. BTW, there's not too many trash cans around. Chances are, you're going to litter and the poor girl behind you is going to kick it.

It gets stuffy as hell in the lines. There's absolutely zero ventilation while you're waiting. No fresh air, constant cigarette smoke, booze in your system, and no water is an inevitable disaster waiting to happen. Possibly even a lawsuit. People getting dizzy and light headed, yack is already found on the ground, people slipping in that yack, and NO, you may not leave the lines even if you're about to piss in your pants. Too bad the suits says, leave and try to re-enter where your friends are and you will be asked to go to the end of the line.

When you finally get in, you are ushered into a bunch of elevators like cattle. The door opens and the elevator man yells out, "WELCOME TO MARQUEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN." At this point you don't know it yet, but you've been put into a scientific experiment that you didn't know you signed up for. Ever wonder what rats thought about when they were put into mazes? You will soon find out. No table service you say, good luck hanging onto all your friends. You might as well say good bye because the only time you'll see them again is when you randomly run into them an hour after you lose them. Ladies this is especially true for you because you girls don't carry your cell phones with you & dudes are constantly trying to break up your pack so their chances increases (baiting club chicks 101).

The place is incredibly packed. Shoulder to shoulder, toe to toe. Don't wear your Louboutins because some drunk tard is going to spill their drink and/or step all over them. Besides, I would recommend comfortable foot wear for men and women. This place houses a billion steps. There are steps EVERYWHERE and you can't access the elevators. By the end of the night, you'll be crying for a $15 Chinese foot massage in Alhambra.

Everyone is dressed to impress. It's like prom but what do you expect from a Vegas club such as this? No one cares about your douchey $300 Ed Hardy sneakers. Throw on some nice leather, even albino aligator skinned kicks, then maybe you won't look like such a fool when the bouncer doesn't deny your entry.

Bars here are a mission. There's 50+ of you for every bartender they have. When you venture for a drink, order an extra drink for yourself. Chances are you won't want to wait another 30 minutes for another drink. Take orders from your friends too, save them the trouble. You might as well take the entire crew up there and whoever gets served first can order for everyone. Don't act appalled when you find out one drink is about $14. You're in Vegas and it's the most happening club right now, not one of your typical hipster Downtown LA dive bars.

Marquee is also a daytime pool hot spot. I think they're going to do very well with that during the summer. It's almost as if they geared their outdoor areas just for that. Cabanas, private jacuzzis, pools, everytthing is top notched, uber grand, and classy.

Music varies depending on the different rooms & which level you're on. The main room started blasting house/electro at one point while the downstairs smaller room had classic hip-hop/rap which is more of my forte, ya dig? Every inch of this place was filled with bodies, there's no escaping it except maybe far outside. There's plenty of eye candy as well as that little thing called a "venereal disease." So play it safe tonight, actually every night.

Bring your credit cards or a wad of dead US presidents (preferably Benjamin Franklin) because it's going to be an expensive night at Marquee. 

Did I fail to mention that it took forever to get out of this rat trap? Good luck all.Dear Marquee bouncers, instead of checking our IDs, how about you check your inflated egos at the door? There's nothing better I'd like to say to you that hasn't already been put perfectly by Ralphie from WTTD: "You think you're hot sh-, but you're really just cold diarrhea!"

Seriously, the bouncers/security are the rudest ones I've ever encountered in all of Vegas. They go around acting like they're curing cancer or guarding Obama or something. As a result, they're condescending, smug, pushy, hostile. It's one thing to have to be stern with overly drunk patrons who are making a scene - but these guys are just d-bags by nature. Every time I've tried talking to them, I've been taken aback by the type of responses I get. My polite and friendly questions are always rebuffed; they smirk and talk down to me like I'm stupid. I half-expect them to pat me on the head and laugh in my face sometimes.

They walk into the girls' restrooms on the regular. They say it's to check for drunk girls. I say it's a weird and creepy invasion of privacy.

They kick out people like it's going out of style. My friend was crouching down to make a phone call so she could hear better, and they kicked her out because they insisted she was peeing in public. I swear the guards get some kind of sick satisfaction with each person they kick out. 
 
They don't let you stand in the aisles. That makes sense, sure - but sometimes I feel like you literally aren't allowed to stop moving for more than 3 seconds before a guard pops up in your face with a flashlight, herding you along, "Can't stop here. Move it along, keep it moving." Are we sheep being herded? Are we cars on the freeway? Can I just catch my breath for a second?

The stairs. Oh, the infamous Marquee stairs. Can we just have a moment of silence for the brilliant architect who designed a club (where half the patrons will be wearing short, tight fabric and high heels) with dark, winding stairs?? Insert confused Jackie Chan meme face.

Sure, Marquee is a gorgeous place, really new and hip. I love the pool on the roof, and I like the idea of different music on different floors. Plus, they get really big names to DJ there, so they must be doing something right. It's a decent space, eons bigger than clubs I've been to in LA or SD (but then again, this IS Vegas, so...) The experience is just completely ruined by the people who work there. 

Overall, I'd go to Marquee again if I had to (maybe for the dayclub; I've never been), but I'd pick XS or Surrender over it anyday.Came here for a girls weekend and Marquee was on our to-do list. We bought tickets in advance to see Sander van Doorn and thank god we did! The line to get in was easy, breezy. Just go upstairs if you have tickets, instead of braving the hordes of people waiting downstairs.

Drinks here are Vegas priced, which translates to hella expensive! I think a round of shots for 4 was $55? And, it was so disgusting. I ended up pouring my vodka shot into some juice. Call me a puss, but I'm too old to down nasty shots. Now, if it's a good tasting shot, sure, bring it on!

It was a pain in the ass getting from the outside to the inside of the club. We had to stand in line just to get back in, instead of just going back in through the open patio. 

It's prettier outside, but the music doesn't sound as good. Be careful of the pools, you don't want to fall in. The music was kinda eh till around 1 am when Sander came on. Then, it got ten times better! We ended up dancing inside, since we wanted to be part of the energy, but it was super annoying getting told to move by security every 5 seconds. Geez! 

We ended up dancing over by the back patio. Whateves. I danced so hard that I broke my heels! And, my feet hurt for 2 days after. 

Beware of the 5 million stairs you'll have to endure on your way out. 

I like XS better though. Better music and better venue. Marquee, you're just average.You really have to look to find this place.  I ended up asking a security guard where it was, and even then I had a little trouble finding it.  I thought the pizza was only okay, but I wasn't really ordering their top notch stuff I guess.  I got the vegetarian pizza, which only tasted okay.  The crust was really good though.  At $6 a slice, its not cheap, but nothing is cheap at the Cosmopolitan.I had the BBQ sampler for lunch, which contains BBQ chicken and BBQ beef. The beef had a great taste but was a bit tough. The chicken reminded me of the chicken you get at a Chinese buffet. Not so good. The rice and mac sides were ho hum. If I was back in town and ate here again, I would go for the BBQ beef and maybe try the fish and shrimp.Everyone is pretty 'meh' on the food.   Took way way too long to serve.   And strangely it's low end soy sauce.  Everyone is confused by that.   My friend got a piece of metal in his food.   I wanted to give it a 2 but my friend said I was being harsh.    Oh last thing --- so pricey!!  Ridiculous pricey.    Don't come here.It is a pricey restaurant and the food is alright. The sushi, however, are super fresh. The atmosphere is kind of rowdy, not a place for a romantic dinner. Definitely try their scallop sashimi, super fresh!This place is alright. Its not the best but its not bad. I think what i hate the most is when the staff harasses you about getting a trainer. Its like, damn not everyone can afford one, or sometimes people just wanna do their own thing. Anyway its not too crowded and its pretty spacious. Love the classes and the machines are new and up to date. As long as you know how to avoid the harassment of getting a trainer, this place is pretty good.Not bad, I had the vegetarian cheesesteak and it was quite delicious. I substituted fruit for the fries and the fruit was pretty fresh and quite tasty too.  O, the cheesesteak was only 15 bucks which wasn't bad considering I paid 30 bucks for fish and chips at Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill and it was total shit.Meh all around except for ambiance. We had a group of 6 so we really ordered a lot of different dishes and I didn't find any particularly great. Most were okay. T

he thin crust pizzas I've def had a lot better elsewhere and would not consider this an exceptional place for it. The ones here were burnt, I.e the fresh basil on one of the pizzas was actually completely black not just slightly smoky. And the combinations of ingredients looked classic with a twist but something was always a bit off, as in you expect it to be really good like classic flavors but with a nice bite of edge but these were never as good as the classic flavors. Actually we ordered their special pizza of the night, which was a spicy mushroom and sundried tomato pizza, sounded amazing but it was way too spicy like I've never had a pizza in my life, no one could have more than a piece and the mushrooms were really tough. 

We also had plenty of appetizers like calamari and their caprese salad with beet both were okay, just good enough. 

So would not highly recommend this restaurant.  I think it's very average and I don't get the good reviews, but if you're just stopping by for convenience why not.Wanted to take cousin for "high tea," served between 12p and 4p, but Narcisse was closed when we arrived around 130'ish.  Checked online and found high tea is only served "by reservation only."  Shoot.  So, we ended up in Tanzy, instead.

Will update soon, I hope!I won't return.  The service was quite embarrassing---the waiter requesting that we pass our plates down, pass down our water glasses, et cetera.  The food was alright, but not fantastic.The food is delicious but service is slow. The pieces of lettuce are large. When I take my food home I have to chop up my lettuce some more because it's too large for my mouth. The portion of meat is a hit or miss. When employees are close to their leaving times and there is a long line, they have no problem complaining about it in front of customers. I suggest calling in before and picking up food. Wish the manager would address the customer service issues.I really wanted to like Citizen Public House because the reviews are so amazing, I thought it was ok.  It always bothers me when I sit down at a table in a nice restaurant and the table cloth is dirty and my plate was not clean...  On the plus side, the service was good.  It was a nice surprise to have the chopped salad, that's a favorite.  I had duck and it was good - it came with sweet potato hash and greens - both good also, could use a little kick - but I like really spicy food!It's not like I could ever afford anything in this mall (it's almost entirely high-end designer shops), but I do find myself walking through here a LOT when in Vegas, because it's the quickest and most air-conditioned route from where I usually stay up to the Bellagio. 

I do sometimes wistfully gaze at Nanette Lapore, Dolce & Gabbana or Prada - but c'mon people. Those clothes cost more than I make in like, 2 or 3 months! So off limits. I mainly go here to escape the heat, play with the toys at FAO, or pay $16.99 for gelato (NEVER AGAIN!), watch the rays swim in the aquarium, or see the cheesy talking statues. 

But! Here's my confession: 
Every time I walk by Versace, I quote Showgirls. 

"LOVE your dress, darlin'"
"Thanks. It's VER-SAAASE". 

:)I seriously come here just for H&M.

Yes, it is a mall but with a Roman twist. Any similar store that targets a market segment are located closely (i.e. luxury: Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada all located in the middle), there are no fast food restaurants like McDonald's or Wendys but there are some pricey ones located on the street facing area. 

Do expect lots of tourists stopping in the middle of their walk to take pictures.Very friendly & helpful staff, plus good food. The free soup was very tasty, it could have been a meal in itself. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly and tender when grilled. The side dishes were a little lacking and not what I have come to expect from dining in Korean restaurants in Chicago, New York and Seoul. However, it was a good experience and we left full and satisfied.I first came to Grimaldi's on a third date, where I was an innocent victim, not realizing I walked into the crossfire of two boys and their pizza food fight.   One boy tried to hit the other boy with the pizza as it mistakenly came flying over to hit me in the arm.  Covered with sauce, their father came to my "rescue" with his filthy napkin and wiped my saucy arm.......clean???   

Great start to a date hey!  haha  

I loved the pizza so much this became one of my favorite places and favorite stories to tell.   The decor is always nice, the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures are a great touch.  For the most part, Grimaldi's has been excellent at all of their locations.  For some reason, the Scottsdale Quarter location has been quite disappointing.  I usually order a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra basil and I love it!  However, it has been burnt the last few times and I don't mean a little burnt.  I mean where you bite into the pizza and it is really dry and crunchy kinda burnt.  Not sure if they have been overcooking the pizza or not putting enough sauce on it, but it has been exceptionally dry.  

My favorite locations are Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch.Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):

CityScape is deservedly notorious for really shitty design with regard to its (lack of) integration with the rest of downtown, but the Arrogant Butcher portion of it is pretty spectacular in how it makes love to the corner for all pedestrians to gape at.

And I really like the interior environment of AB, too.  The service is also really crisp.

Everything I've ordered has been average-to-very good, but the menu doesn't excite me much -- which could very well just be a matter of taste.  Dishes that I have particularly enjoyed, though, are the Italian Grinder sandwich, and the pretzel fondue (which i love love love).

In my experience, the drinks read better than they actually taste, but I am a big fan of the Streetfighter (which isn't on the menu anymore, but I hope they can still make it next time I'm in).

To sum it all up, I definitely enjoy Arrogant Butcher, but usually only when I find myself nearby.This is a really fund concept. Buy a few drinks and watch a movie, and if the movie is in french (a language i don't know) just get some more drinks and it wont matter what language they are speaking. I heard this place had food, but when we went they notified us that their kitchen was no more. Sad day, food would have made this place that much better. Some people brought a meal in and ate outside in the lounge. 

The lounge is very hookah bar esque, and i am surprised they don't have hookah there.. This is a fun little place. I don't know if i'd go back, unless they had a really good documentary i want to see...Came here a few weeks ago with my friend who said it's pretty good.  She had gone a few times and since we recently went to Dom Demarco's, we wanted to compare the two since she said they were the two best in the greater Las Vegas area.

We ended up going with a salad as an appetizer.  She picked the spinach salad that was so-so.  It was a bit dry and didn't really have too much flavor to it.

The pizza was actually pretty good though.  I chose the Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto.  It features cooked ham, fontina, caramelized onions, oregano, and aged balsamic.  I don't get pizza featuring prosciutto often but this one was pretty good.  The caramelized onions was a nice touch.  

This spot is A-Ok.  If you're in the Summerlin area, I'd recommend it!Too bad they closed this location.After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give them a try. As far as food quality and taste: excellent and worth every penny. 
My reason for only three stars is that the flow of my visit was clunky. 
(1) When I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess opened the door for me, which I didn't expect and I thought that she was going to say they were closed or that I had to go through another entrance or something...It doesn't help that the doors open outward and she has to PUSH the doors instead of PULLING the doors and remaining inside the establishment.
(2) When I went to the bar to place my takeout order, I felt like an obstacle to the employees since the computer screen where they clock in was where the to-go customers place the orders and in the five minutes I stood there two employees had to apologize for squeezing in to clock in. Why isn't that computer screen placed somewhere only the employees have access to?
(3) While waiting for my order, I couldn't help but scope out the venue (I love the decor, and the outdoor space looks great!), but my eyes fell on the hostess stand. An employee who appears to be the manager was speaking with the hostess (the one who opened the door). Some customers were coming toward the entrance and she went to open the door for them, and of course, since the door opens outward, the hostess ended up outside. The employee at the hostess stand was standing there, and asked, "Dinner for two?" The customers confirmed, then the "manager" gave the hostess major stinkeye to hurry up and seat them while she was still outside holding the door! As fellow employees, he should watch her back. He could of done things very differently: (a) be a gentleman and open the door, (b) say "welcome to Grimaldi's, the hostess will be right with you" or (c) sit the customers himself (he was hanging out behind the stand long enough to see the next section to seat). Instead, he made the hostess look incompetent. 
(4) The same "manager" carried out my order from the kitchen but HAD to go back to the hostess stand and stood and talked for a WHOLE MINUTE with my pizza in his hand. What should have been piping hot and fresh from the oven turned to two minutes sitting in a cardboard box, then placed in my hands. 
These are super simple fixes! All they have to do is:
(1) Install the computer somewhere only the employees have access to. 
(2) Keep the front entrance doors open during business hours and don't make the hostess open doors as part of her duties, it's hella awkward... 
(3) Teach that particular employee about "teamwork"; his dawdling around slowed the bar's service, the hostess's service and wasted the cook's speedy effort.I think 3.5 stars had green chili burger no bun, salad instead of fries - great taste! Pablano peppers had touch oh cold probably cooked in advance than added to burger. Manager spent time everywhere but visiting with the guest.My wife and I stopped in at the Capri Cafe, and we weren't sure what to expect.  We had picked up a copy of the menu beforehand, and were very impressed with the price of the sandwiches.  We got the ham and pimiento sandwich, the heart of palm sandwich, and a tiny chocolate dessert pastry.  Upon receiving our food, we realized that you actually only get a half of a sandwich per order; this was fine -- we weren't that hungry-- but we felt a little deceived.  

As for the quality of the food, the sandwiches were both a little heavier on the mayonnaise than we cared for them to be, but were fairly tasty.  We plan on stopping by to try their empanadas, as those are probably what the restaurant will come to be known for.Waffles infused with bacon bits!!! OMG! They are the best, I will say they are a bit pricey at 8.00 for 1 waffle, but a girls got to have her bacon! They also make their own Margaritas and they are on tap! Whoaaa, they are fantastic!!!

Heading this week for Yelp eats! New update then!Gotta say, I was a bit disappointed.  All my friends seem to rave about this place but I wasn't a huge fan. The food was a bit pricey but  you do get a lot of it.  I shouldn't sacrifice taste because I'm getting a large portion.   I had the fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes and it was around $15.  I think the real clincher was the service.  I realize this can be hit or miss but our service was not good at all.  The gal seemed like she really didn't want to be there and you felt bad asking for the basics such as a glass of water.  We did order drinks with our dinner as well.  

Maybe we will try it out for breakfast sometime or lunch, I hear the mac and cheese is delicious.  I really doubt I will go back for dinner though.Met up with the International Supper Club UYE at Reathrey Sekong for the monthly pick of November, we were a party of 12, and it was suggested to us that since we were a larger party that we should order dishes family style.  I get the reasoning behind it, 1 cook in the kitchen, not everyone would be eating at the same time, I'm just not that big on seafood dishes and eating family style wasn't going to work for me, so I broke the rules and ordered for myself

I have to say our waiter was amazing, he was working the entire place by himself, did an outstanding job! Everyone was also enjoying the dishes they were trying too. The restaurant is nicely decorated and cozy, I have to say I enjoyed out time where conversing with everyone.

I don't remember the name of the item I ordered, but it was a beef sandwich on a french roll with like a carrot slaw pickles and cilantro, the sandwich itself was on the sweet side, which was shocking, I was thinking more savory since it was beef, but I did quite enjoy it!

Another fun International Supper Club UYE meet up!Since they opened in Vegas, I've been wanting to see what all the hype was about, I've been hearing about it across the country; how its the best burger.
Since it was my first experience I like to go with a plain cheeseburger, if it can stand alone without a bunch of toppings, that will bump you up on my "best" list.
What I initially didn't like was the greasy smell in the restaurant, when we left I smelled like I just got done a shift there. YUCK!
Well the burger was good, lots of hot gooey cheese, the bun was soft and fresh. Tasted a little bland, so I doubt they season their meat, so it tasted like a burger you may get at a family barbecue or an amusement park. I'd eat it again, but I would choose Smashburger over 5 Guys any day. We got the plain fries, which were pretty gross, they were brown and greasy not crisp at all, we ate maybe 10 fries and threw the rest away.
I liked that they had a bucket of peanut to snack on while waiting for your burger. Staff was nice and helpful, andswered all my "firsttimer" questions.Here are the issues I have with cox.  
My internet connection is "lost" at least twice each week:  Our home has 3 laptops with wireless internet connections.  About twice each week, the internet connection is lost, which requires unplugging the modem and router, waiting a minute, and plugging them back in.  I had to do this yesterday and today, so hopefully I won't have to do this for another 6 days. 

Unbelievably slow email:  I no longer use cox email because it is so incredibly slow:  it takes so long to load, that by the time the inbox appears, I've forgotten what I'm looking for.  Same problem with the search:  I search for something and by the time emails appear, I can't remember what I wanted to review.  I switched to gmail, but I can't stand this either because I can't sort, but it least it's fast.  I gave up using cox when I couldn't access an email containing a forgotten username for the umpteenth time.

Don't under any circumstances use the virus software that they provide for free.  If you do, you'll regret it.  I installed the software and had so many issues with my pc not running correctly.  As soon as this was uninstalled, all was well again.  Try superantispyware - not only is this FREE, but it's one of the best programs that will ferret out all types of garbage that gets installed on your pc.  I've never had a real issue because i'm so careful, but this finds hundreds of items each week on my pc that it doesn't like.

The reason I'm writing this review is because the option to color code movies on the tv listings on their website hasn't been working correctly for months:
1.  I have to type in my zip code every time I access this site, which can be several times a day.  
2. I basically only watch movies - which I want to see in pink in the listings.  Even though the box is checked, the listings aren't pink.  When I uncheck the box, then they're pink.   Is it possible that I'm the only person in Arizona that uses this feature on their website?  It's  a simple fix:  a cookie should remember my zip code, and the web page needs to recognize that a checkbox with a checkmark is "on" - show the color.Stumbled upon this place in search for a late brunch (a drunken night provided false intel that there was a Hash House in the Cosmopolitan, when in reality its in Imperial Palace) and realized this was a ManVFood Location.

First off, the ambiance is nice, but what I got a kick out of the most was there were workers outside flashing the menu, trying to get people to enter... lol... taking a cue from those non-english speaking "stripper" promoters eh?

Their menu is, for lack of a better way to put it... too expansive for its own good!  Haha, there were just so many choices, including desert, which they are famous for.

I ordered the Bacon Club Sandwhich, my friend the open faced tuna melt, another got a french dip, and another a burger.  We also split deep-fried macaroni.

The club was pretty good...nothing spectacular, as was the tuna melt.  The French Dip was pretty tender, and the burger pretty tasty... but nothng to go crazy over.  The Fried Macaroni appetizer was pretty good. Hot, fresh, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside.  However, $9 for 3 golf-ball sized clumps? Wow.  The fries (shoe string style) were cooked well, very crispy and tasty.

Their deserts are really good though.  My friend got the Nutella Cream Crepe... and it was so awesomely sweet, I went staight into 3rd stage Diabetes.  I wouldn't call it overly sweet, since it is called the Sugar factory afterall.

Waiters are pretty attentive, and service pretty quick.  The attached candy store next door has a lot of choices, so b prepared!  Gelato, cookes, cupcakes, and even discontinued, rare types of candy r found here (Bazooka Joe!)Fiance and I finally got to try Kyara last Friday.  There have been so many great reviews, we just never really in that side of town for date night.  

Anywho, we were there and I was reading through my trusted yelpers' reviews.  We ordered grilled squid, butter squid, the chicken skin skewer, pork belly skewer, chicken thigh skewer, gizzard skewer, eggplant with meat miso, green tea, orion beer and a pour of the yamazaki 18 yr.

Grilled squid was pretty good.  I had to ask for a side of sriracha to eat with it.  Then, everything else was pretty mediocre.  The end of our meal, we asked ourselves, "Did we come on a bad  night?" Maybe...but we agreed that this place is A-OK.I got two types of spring rolls here: tofu and shrimp. Delicious! However the peanut sauce was disappointing so I round it to 3.5 stars.

I do want to come back and try some different things on the menu, then I'll reconsider my rating.I have two reviews in one, but I will start with tonight's. All I have to say is, it seems, from other reviews, that this place needs a new delivery guy.

I call to ask to get a pizza delivered - I chose mellow mushroom because they have vegan pizza (I am severely lactose intolerant) because last time I had their vegan pizza in-house, I liked it a LOT and had a craving. Due to some issues that don't need to be gotten into, I cannot go there myself and get it, so I asked for delivery. 

When I told the girl where I lived (on Guadalupe), she said she thought they stopped delivery at Baseline but would go ask. The girl (who was very nice) comes back on the phone and says the delivery guy is "in a bad mood tonight" and said no and when she explained that I am (apparently) only 2 miles out of their zone, he said "I don't answer to you." I asked to speak to the manager and she said "he was standing right there when I asked." 


REALLY? What the heck kind of place is this? What kind of boss stands around and lets employees talk to each other like that (from what I hear, the delivery jerk is related to the boss, so maybe that's it?)

My second review, from 2 times of actually being at this restaurant, is the same. The food, except for the vegan pizza (which is SO GOOD, but kind of on the expensive side...) isn't very good. I ordered the cinnamon honey pretzels and they were so dry they weren't edible. The garlic/cheese bread is also incredibly dry. 

If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery, I *might* have given them 3 stars, but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have, they only get 2. Which is really a bummer, because their vegan pizza is so good.

EDIT!!: Alright, so a few hours after I wrote this review, the general manager, Jason, called me about my review to apologize and talk with me about what happened. He apologized multiple times for the awkward situation that went down, and while he was not present when it happened, he obviously took my review seriously. He then offered to deliver a free pizza to me himself, and that if I didn't want it this evening, he would bring it any other time. I took him up on his offer and he brought me a pizza. 

Being in a manager position myself, I understand sometimes what managers have to go through, and his choice to call me and try to make it right is commendable and I really appreciated it. Sometimes businesses or employees mess up, but what matters is what they do to FIX it. Jason went the extra mile. 

Thanks to this, I changed my review to 3 stars. Also, this vegan pizza is amazing as always.This place has a nice selection of Shoes. The customer service here or lack thereof was what put them at 3 stars. I was in the store for about 20 minutes and not once, out of the 20 employees working the store was I acknowledged even once.

I did end up buying 2 clearance shoes that were really comfortable.You know, after reading all the reviews I was really excited to try this sushi joint. It was packed when I got there which is always a good sign you know they are moving a lot of product and everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH. So why three stars? To begin, the sushi its self was cut and prepared right, but I felt constantly harassed to order my next item and could never relax and savor the experience.
The rice was the right texture, and I felt the portion was good. Hot dishes take quite a bit of time to come out so be sure to order them in advance. The conch special was incredible, but I did't care for their saba or hamachi, I've had much better at other establishments. 
In my experience they are a good sushi restaurant, but I'm not sure about all the hype? I'll have to try it again.I love the design, layout, lighting, etc. The ambiance is truly stellar. It's always packed with people every time I go, which makes this feel like a real city eatery and social drinking depot. The drinks - well prepared. No. 63 was lip smackin' good. The food - pleasantly passable. It somewhat flirts with the palate and does just the trick to soak up a sip or two of bourbon. I wish I had no more to say...

[She bites her knuckles and hesitates] Boy does it pain me to knock off stars for service. Mistake me not, this feedback isn't impulsive retribution after one sour puss waiter. Time after time, I leave thinking "why couldn't they just be nicer?" I don't need to be spoon fed, have my napkin tucked under my chin or showered with compliments I wasn't fishing for. I also don't mind if you are cooler, more hipster or read more Kerouac than me.

I just don't want to feel like I'm inconveniencing someone for a meal that comes out of my wallet in the end. Inattentive and unresponsive. Regardless of the other positive traits Windsor has going for it, there is still something very unsatisfying when you leave feeling like you were just another annoyance in a sea of demanding diners.I know everybody loves this place and it does have a nice charm. I really appreciated that in December they were not playing Christmas music during my meal!
I have eaten here a few times and while I enjoy my meal for me it's nothing spectacular. Even the loaded chips everyone recommended were only so so to me. The menu does have a variety of unique choices which is worth giving a try and I'm sure I will be back with friends again but this is not someplace that I would pick on my own.My husband and I had a college reunion with friends --- and we all stayed at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. After everyone arrived, we all met up at the downstairs lobby bar for some drinks and chillaxin'.

What was great was the relaxing vibe, LIVE MUSIC playing, and the prompt service. 
Happy Hour was 5-8 pm, with cocktails at only $5 each. I ordered a light drink, called the Framboise Fizz (raspberry flavor w/ some gin?).

My husband had a Corona light at $7. Reasonable prices, and good way to hang out with friends before we all head out to dinner! Seats were comfortable, and liked how they had live music up until a certain hour!Why I came here? 

Because I was staying at the Vdara. I was too lazy to go out and get breakfast somewhere else. I really didn't wanna pay the room service price. 

So if you've got the same reasons to go, then go. 

Food was pretty good, but definitely not the price I paid for it. Service is friendly and as I was waiting for my to-go order, I had people constantly asking me if I needed anything or if I've been helped. 

They have cheese and wine and other grocery store items as well if you'd like. I'm sure they're overpriced too, but hey...people gotta make money somehow right? They just like to make a lot.Insert Credit Card, max it out.  

Mixed feelings about this spot.  On one hand, rad idea, concept, large space, and something different to do than surrounding bars are offering.  Cool deep benches/booths along one side.  A bajillion games and shiny blinking things to look at all over the place.  On the other hand, I just can't stand getting hosed on drink cost.  

I ordered a simple bubbly cocktail off of their cocktail menu (no prices listed) but I was prepared to pay about $12-13 for it.  Right?  Vegas pricing, it was a specialty cocktail, whatevs.  After some delay, they said they were opening the bubbly... hang tight... ok... watch some football on the screens above the bar for several minutes before figuring out it was a video game, not television...  thirsty... 

Drink in hand, good time, not bad, but teensy tiny (maybe 3 oz?), then the bill came.  They charged me $5 extra for the bubbly, saying they were out of the cheaper one used in the cocktail so they'd substituted another!  What the effing eff?  I was ready to drop a pretty penny in this joint on lotsa drinks but that rubbed me the wrong way.  

So... it was fun, but it could have been much more fun.  Ron T and I still ran some shenanz in that place anyway, and I sneaked in some p-ball while no one was looking.  My $18 sip of a cocktail just turned me off too much to stay there for more drinks, even if I'd switched to cheaper ones.  Cha-ching.  

If you're into video games, don't miss it, and it's good for a large group.  But if you're just roaming and want to make sure you have some coins left at the end of the night, don't do what I did and blindly order without knowing the cost.Yummy hummus, tasty salad, flavorful chicken shawarma.  And the bread is more like naan, rather than pita from the bag that was sliced into pretty little triangles. 

Went for dinner carryout. Wish I would have went for lunch I would have saved a few bucks. I think my chicken shawarma came out to 14 bucks (ouch!).  My sister ordered the a vegetarian dish, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush - from her empty plate, I imagine she liked it. I'll go for the lunch next time, hoping it will be cheaper yet filling for my tummy.The atmosphere was nice. Got in free with my girlfriend, since a club promoter was passing out wristbands. I have to say, the music was so-so. Everyone was pretty chill, not really dancing except for a few cougars. I have to say, there is a lot of cougars in this joint lol. I stayed for an hour or so, and I had to call it a night. Too be honest, I'm not really a "club" type person.Been coming here on and off since it opened and found that it is a sports bar. It is a smaller version of what is in the valley and be kinda cramped. The capacity is def not like the one on Indian School. They have a good section of drinks and beer, it has consistent food and it has speedy service. Alot of regulars for sure and good mix of people can be found on game day, from families with small kids, to 20 somethings. The place can get packed, but have never had to wait. Will continue to come back.A decent Mexican food option if you're in the area. I sat at the bar and had the carne asada tacos with rice and black beans. I thought the seasonings and heat level were good.  Friendly service.I had the pleasure of stopping at this restaurant by chance after doing some bumping around in FH.  This is a pretty cool establishment.  When you walk in, there is a feel of a country western establishment.  At about 4pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't packed, but it certainly wasn't empty.  There were quite a few people in there.  

My friend and I were quickly seated in the bar area at one of the high tops.  I quickly noticed the selection of beer on tap and ordered a yummmmy Kilt Lifter from 4 Peaks. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the Buzzard Wings.  I ordered the Patty Melt.  When our food came out, I immediately saw that the Patty Melt was on Rye bread.  I dislike Rye Bread.  I realized I didn't look at the description of the sandwhich.  Before I could even get out that I didn't see it on the menu, the server said, we can do it over with whatever bread you want.  Of course,  I thanked her for quickly getting me out Patty Melt on sourdough bread instead.  Both of these items on the menu were yummy to me.  The wings cooked in the broaster have a delicious unique taste to them.  I highl recommend these wings to anyone.  My Patty melt was also very delicious and savory.

I enjoyed myself at this restaurant even though it is in F.H.  I would see myself going back to this place.  I'm a fan!This review is past due. We tried Ben's BBQ at Streats. We sampled the ribs and pulled pork. The meats had a nice smoke. It was a shame the ribs were very fatty, there wasn't much meat. The pork was the better choice, though I wish the bread was better. The spicy sauce lacked the kick we hoped for, but it wasn't total weak sauce.

This is one of those instances I wish there were half-stars. It wasn't quite an A-OK experience, there was room for improvement.Have to say that their service has improved a lot. Order has been correct and they seem to take pride that they are the spot on Baja Arcadia for doughnuts. Haven't been hard selling the up sale and polite and courteous over the past 4 months. Kudos, keep up the good work.Pizza was good, but the price was to much for a pizza. I do like that there's lactose free, gluten free options but $20 dollars for a pizza is too much.The Mint was an awesome place and great party atmosphere. Theres a bunch of older people than younger. The bartenders were friendly and attentive! I would go back.I would say the best way to describe The Habit is a place that offers tasty burgers at a good price. The burgers are't top of the line, but definitely better than traditional fast food. If your looking for a decent burger without having to shell out $$, this is your place. On the plus side, they also offer sweet potato fries and carry chicken, tuna and veggie burgers - but there aren't really any combo deals...everything is pretty much a la carte. The place is clean and the service is good with a short wait for your food because they make everything fresh = fries are always hot and crisp...yum!We live close by and its the only food spot close traveling North on Cave Creek that kids like. Their kids burgers have literally nothing in them, besides a meat patty and 2 buns... the kids were like " Wheres our lettuce and tomatoes, mama?" The regular burgers are greasy because the bread gets buttered up. If you are really starving you can stop by, otherwise dont waist your calories and appetite on this!Nice enough folks, no street bikes or street gear, so if that is your genre skip this place.  On the other hand, if you are into motocross and 4 wheelers, you will find plenty to choose from.Chips and salsa were great! The margaritas were decent and the food was yummy! This is probably the closest to authentic that we've gotten since we got down to Arizona.Well, it is the MVD. Plan to spend an hour waiting in line to get a ticket that will tell you how long you have to wait in line. Pretty sure there should be an MVD drinking game- Kid screams, take a drink. Same number called twice in a row, take a drink. Told to come back with additional paperwork, finish your drink (and go home to search your files). Judging from the website where you can see average wait times, this is one of the faster locations in the West Valley.

The ONE bright spot in this (and the reason for the third star) was that the woman who helped us transfer the title on a car was fantastic. She was fast, friendly, helpful, and knew her stuff. I can imagine that working for the MVD is not a pleasant job, but she made the experience as positive as humanly possible. Because I believe excellent customer service should be commended, I asked to talk to her manager and told the manager our service was great. The manager was on the phone, but I do hope that employee got an extra pat on the back for a job well done.i don't know hooow this place got such high reviews... i think it's over hyped.

nevertheless, i wouldn't mind stopping by again when i'm staying at Wynn or Encore.  the tacos are SO much cheaper than what they got in the hotel!! totally worth the short walk from Encore lol

their salsa is fantastic! it makes chipotle's look like a joke.  don't underestimate it though, it's hella spicy! i'm from east coast so i was loving the authenticity of mexican food from southern west coast.  the steak taco is recommended-- i couldn't get myself to try those cow brains and w/e strangeness they were offering.. 

just a quick note about their quesadillas.. they're not your typical american quesadillas.. it looks something like between a sandwich and a salad.. bottomline--  it's really hard to eat! 

but yeah, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place even if you love nothing but tacos.I will not lie, Lisa L. has it right to come here to people watch. The mixture  of risque, Jersey Shore, Ed Hardy type, and frat boys leads to some mighty entertaining sights.

The Boulevard Pool is a lounge and entertainment center by all means and less of a pool. The shallow large foot pool is enough to dip your feet in and recreate a scene from Bay Watch, but not for actual swimming. The other pool and hot tubs are nice for wadding and lightly submerging oneself, but yet again not good for even doggy paddling. 

The bar and pool are staffed with friendly individuals that are quick to meet the guests needs. 

The lounge chairs were comfortable. 

The four pool tables, one ping pong table, and shuffleboard allows for some good fun.I have had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries a few times and they are pretty decent.  I actually like the unique soda flavors it's a bit of a break from the Coke / Pepsi war.  I had a gellato shake and I'm not sure that's the best ice cream to make a shake with. It's way sweet so it tastes like frozen sugar more than anything.

Try:
- Veggie Burger
- Sodas
- Sweet Potato FriesI must be tainted with magic as I only thought the show was average.  Jans seems like a really nice and personable guy, but his magic was a bit sub-par when compared to what you see with David Copperfield or Criss Angel.  I guess all the illusionists have the same premise with people disappearing and reappearing, but Copperfield and Angel just seem a lot more "polished" and entertaining, but I guess you pay for what you get.

What I did like is that at the end, Jans comes out and takes pictures with his audience.  Also, the theater at the Clarion was small, so no matter where you sit, you're going to get a decent seat.  However, I must warn you that he did say he's moving to the Riviera in a few weeks, so I'm not sure how their theater is set-up.

Overall, the show was decent considering we got privileged (I think that's what they called it) tickets, so the price was half with a buy one get two tickets admission which you can find in the Las Vegas show magazines you get for free at hotels.  With the privileged tickets, you get seated before the general admission ticket holders and if you get the tickets with the buy one get two coupon, it's pretty much the same price, so you might as well get this deal for better seats.  Oh, and the buy one get two coupon doesn't work for general admission tickets, so...

Overall, it was good to see a magic show for cheap, but there are probably better ones out there.Two visits in two days, but in different locations. The food court choices all looked bad, but I had remembered hearing about this Taco Shop and since I'm a huge carne asada fan, here we go. The carne in my burrito was tasty, had some crunch too it and from what I can tell no fatty pieces were involved. The $6 small burrito had carmelized onions and guac and a tasty spicy salsa was served on the side. Might be the best carne in this mall, but I went to another location the next day and didn't have the best breakfast burro. That burrito was from the University Drive restaurant and the carne did have some fatty pieces here and the potatoes they used for the breakfast burros were too small and chopped up and the whole thing just didn't come together well. KInd of greasy and just average. Hopefully, the mall court comes through again on my next visit because good carne is tough to find.Ok... Let's be honest, it's a desert. If you're like my fiance, then you think that because it has 3 leaves of spinach and some acai in it, then it's a "healthy meal"... I disagree. It may be naturally occurring sugar but it's got lots of it. Topped with honey and granola. Yum, yes. Healthy, debatable.

Also, the prices are way too high, and the wait was ridiculous. I really thought it was delicious (Go Green Bowl) but I don't think I'll pay or wait for it again. Sorry! Not super impressed.I liked the pizza alot but the people I spoke to were really rude. They seemed annoyed I called and that tends to put a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'll come back.We called for delivery and were told that they couldn't deliver because the delivery guys truck was broke down. We really wanted to try this place out so we went ahead and drove over to pick up. We were told the pizza would be ready in about 25 mins. We got there 30 mins after calling. When we tried to pay the CC machine wasnt working and we had to pay cash. Again, not a huge deal- just another inconvenience. We then waited at least another 15 mins for our pizza to be ready. 

With all that said, the pizza was AMAZINGLY good. Wings were mediocre- could have been crispier- but the pizza---- seriously awesome.  We got the meatlovers and a pepperoni/sausage/mushroom...both larges. They were huge and fed our family of 6 with pizza left over. The entire family loved the pizza. 

Please fix your customer service issues. We will give you a pass on them and try again simply because the food was so great. But if the customer service stuff doesnt get better we wont keep coming back.Sorry but this place should not be called a ballroom just because there is one disco ball inside. It is a more casual place kind of hipster. I would change the name to something else because crescent ballroom sounds too glamorous for what it actually is.Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. Service is friendly too. Definitely worth going back for more!Cravin Cajun is a normal place to eat. Well, what does that mean? It means that while nothing stands out, nothing was bad.

So the layout is well done with both bench and booth seating. The only complaint is the glaring lightbulb that is right at eye level but on request, it can be dimmed.

The food was good but not very spicy, so that really depends on your individual preference as to why you chose to go to a Cajun themed place in the first place. The sweet potato tots were good, as was the calamari appetizer. The dish, a mix of catfish and prawns, was good as well.
 
The service, you guessed it, normal. I noticed a few others citing poor service. 

I was surprised at the small menu selection and a noticeable lack of 'here is the main entree area' from which to choose. 

The price was normal as well but it correlated with the portion size, normal.

So, try it and see if there is a normal item that you may like.Wow! I haven't been to IHOP in years! I think I got bougie due to all the trendy brunch spots I've been exposed to.  I like how bright, shiny and new it is!  Even though I don't eat meat, I love how they now have turkey sausage.  The fruit was really fresh and thank you to our waitress for letting us sample some to check.  She was a fantastic waitress!  I ordered the Spinach & Mushroom Omelette with egg substitute and pancakes.  My friends ordered the Garden Omelette and Eggs and Turkey Sausage.  Everything was fine, but I definitely see how my palette has matured, lol.  I miss the country griddle pancakes IHOP used to have!I've never been to the actual building, but a girl brought half a dozen of these to my BIL when he was visiting. Some of the most BEAUTIFUL cupcakes I've ever seen; but also some of the most disgusting. Too dry and the frosting was way too sugary. If they hadn't been a gift none of us would have touched them.Decent place to stop by for lunch outside of the strip. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday so their Make It 2 Combo of a half sandwich and bowl of soup was the perfect item to order! The broccoli and cheddar soup was creamy with the right ratio of broccoli to cheese. The Brookyln is a standard pastrami with coleslaw sandwich that is a local version of the Langer's #19 in Los Angeles. Portion size is perfect to fight hunger yet not cause and food coma. Success!The restaurant has a nice homey feel to it as soon as you walk in. Not sure if this place really gets busy. There was only one other table and they looked like they were studying. The menu isn't very extensive, but they have daily specials.

It was my first time coming here and I didn't know what a lot of the items were, but the waiter was very helpful. We ended up ordering the karaage chicken, tororin omelet rice, and garlic green beans. My friend said the wait was a bit long, and boy he wasn't kidding. The garlic green beans came out first.. I wish they were a bit more garlicy ]: The omelet rice was decent. I liked that the tomato sauce was homemade. My favorite was the karaage chicken. Lots of flavor in little bite size pieces fried to perfection.

I want to come back to try their drinks and hopefully their other specials.Wanted to really like this place. It's quaint, well appointed, and I like the idea of fusion French/Italian/Japanese. Problem is the food is just so-so, but worse, it's expensive for the small portion size (I guess the French influence). Service is also just so-so, especially not being busy at all. Service was not so friendly but could be a language thing.I'm sorry, I just cannot get into many Asian foods, Japanese included. I rarely, very, very rarely eat Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc. With the exception of sushi. I don't know, call me a white-bread-eatin' American? The thing is I am excited to try new culinary cuisines, but Asian-inspired dishes just are not my cup of tea for some reason. The spices, the tastes... they just don't hit my palette like Italian and Mexican dishes do.

With that being said I think Cafe de Japon is A-OK. It would probably be bumped to 4 stars if I truly enjoyed Japanese food. On my trip here I had the Pre-Fixe lunch menu. It came with a small salad - very good and fresh. Next was the agedashi tofu appetizer, which I thought was okay. I'm not a huge tofu fan, and even this hearty dish failed to get me super excited about it. For my main course I had the tororin omelet with rice. It was hearty and rich, plus the ketchup gave it a taste as though it had been cooked in a kitchen at a home. 

Lastly I had the siphon coffee, which was FABULOUS. I would come back for the coffee, but probably not anything else. 

Overall I think those who really love Japanese food will love Cafe de Japon, but for me I will probably stick to doing a full-out meal elsewhere.Always clean and the have a blockbuster blue box rental in the back by the bathrooms.I was taken here by a friend who is a Vegas local. Although I never eat this LARGE. I thought the idea was very cute. 

I ordered the bacon stuffed waffle with fried chicken breast. And it was HUGE. lol. See my pic. The waffle was delicious. Can't wait to try it at home. 

But the chicken breast not so much. My chicken breast kind of bled....!!! How? I can't really say. But it was not cooked through. Maybe the slice was to BIG but after seeing a little blood I was done. 

He waiter (I forgot his name) but he was kinda blunt and didn't really care that often times we were trying to signal him. He joked about the water being from some local lake. I didn't find it too funny because it tasted like it was from the toilet!!! 

I would MAYBE try them again just for the sake of changing this review.This place is ok. Although this is my first ramen restaurant I have been to so I cannot compare it to any other spots. 

I like the decor and the theme in general. Didn't care for the food.Food was actually pretty darn good.  The turn off was the whole time we were trying to eat , they were walking around killing flies. Not the most appetizing thing in the world.Only reviewing this with regards to it's Christmas party nights.
Decent terrine but could have done with some biscuits, turkey was cold and sprouts hard so hardly touched the main course, cheese board was fine but the bread and butter pudding was excellent.


 £27 for what I take it is the house rose was extortionate though and the DJ was pretty rubbish on the whole (playing an Abba mega-mix twice doesn't really make for a great night). No idea how much a pint was as expected it to be over-priced so took my own supply.This place is a unique combo...

The place is 3 stories, and there is a rooftop bar that overlooks Scottsdale Olde  town.  That is cool.  The food is bar food, but also has things like Alligator Tail and Crawfish.  That is pretty cool. Not necessarily my thing but still different.  That is the Good. Also Chad K. is bartending there and that is great as he is completely quality and usually any place he is at becomes a party in itself.  

The Bad is that the place is new, and doesn't quite have its customer service down pat yet.  Our waitress seemed like she was a Gneub.  It wasn't that busy and she couldn't get stuff right.  It very well could have been a bad day for her though. She was still nice. 

I think it could be a cool place of happy hour and a fun place to rock football on Sundays.We became acquainted with Zingers because it's a hop away from the Polo Towers, where we stayed over President's Day weekend. They serve breakfast, as well as giant plastic souvenier guitars and lava lamps for all your carry-along booze needs. $12 for the first one, $6 for refills no matter how many times you stop by.

They do karaoke at night, which wasn't exactly hopping when we were there. But to be fair, it was a frio night when we went with no space-heaters on. The die-hards were out there though, belting out 80s classics. I give them an A for effort, F for sobriety.

Good bartenders. I'm already missing my plastic guitar full of Green Sneaker.Living in Tucson, this is the gas station I always stop at before returning home when I'm in the Phoenix area.  Usually, it's just to grab a snack, something to drink, and a little gas.  I like it's location as one of the last places to stop before leaving the Phoenix area if you are traveling Eastbound on I-10.   It is very close to the on and off ramp.  Bathrooms aren't that large or spectacular.Had wings for lunch today. The garlic parmesan is definitely the favorite out of the three flavors we tried. It was really just average on the food and service. The waitress was kind enough but they were slow in seating and serving. The prices are pretty good.. not as expensive as payton's place but I don't see them making it unless they create a little more excitement.Pleasant place.  None of the table's dishes shouted Thai; seemed more fusion.  I give special chops to the staff and the hostess in particular.  They were quite pleasant to all the diners while dealing with a lot of drunk tourists in a very small area.

If your wanting Thai food you might try another place but if you're happy with Asian then LT is your ticket.I live nearby the #2 location near Carefree Hwy and have eaten in the place several times since it opened last fall.   Not as busy inside with diners as it used to be when it first opened but they do a fair amount of carry out orders.  The restaurant is clean but the place is kind of weird with too many TV's and just one big space.  The wall appliques of various people are strange too, rather stereotypical, if you ask me.

Now to the food, it's good and you get a lot for your $.  I would actually rate it 3 1/2 stars but Yelp won't let you do 1/2 stars. Not the best Chinese I have ever had but reliable and the wait staff is attentive and the food comes out quick  They were smart to open where they did because there is a lack of Asian choices in the area.  They even wrap up your leftovers for you, which is a nice touch.
 
Ordered carryout last night and got the Gen. Taos Chicken and Orange Beef, good tastes and the food held up well getting home (not too soggy!).  Like most Chinese food it was too salty.

Looks like a new Chinese place is coming near the Albertson's on Carefree Hwy.. Moon something?, So let's see what a little competition does.  Maybe one of them will start delivery (hint, hint!)

I will return!i've always thought that it would be great for a wahoo's to open up in vegas.  they finally did!

if your in the mood for some fish tacos, this is a nice spot.  they don't have the fried kind (which i prefer), but the fish they do have is a good as its a mild fish taste and meaty.  the other kinds of meats, like the beef and chicken, are good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  in my opinion, they could use a little bit more kick.  this is a good option if your eating healthy as you could substitute for brown rice.  brown rice and fish = a meal to not feel guilty about.

the portions are really large and the prices are decent.  i love their white rice..its seasoned nicely. not a big fan of the white beans though.  i'll like to stick with the normal black.

its brand new and clean so the ambience is great.  theres also a bar with happy hour and i think they even have some slots (only in vegas!).  its kind of hard to find since its not on the main road.  keep on the look out for it near rainbow and sunset.Overall, the singing and dancing were great. The star singer/performer Ms. Reeves sounded fantastic, but was WAY over the top with her mannerisms as she tried to mimic Tina Tuner and Diana Ross. It was practically mockery.  If it had not been for her buffoonery, I'd have given this show a 4.The atmosphere was the only good thing about this restaurant. The sushi was bland and the proportion were small. They do have a good deal on groupon that might be worth checking out though.Overall, it was good but it wasn't the best burger I've ever had.  It's a good option at Town Square, and I hope that it will stick around since it seems like it's particular location has a hard time.  (It was previously a pizza joint.)

It was pricey for what seemed like an average burger, i.e., the normal toppings/condiments.  I'm not a fan of super fried stuff (other than french fries) so the menu seemed a bit limited to me.  (My husband, on the other hand, had trouble choosing between the different burgers.)

I like that they offer beer, and I believe they have happy hour.  They also have free wi-fi  and were showing various sports games on tv's.

I'll probably go back but it's not a must try or die type of place.Old Town Whiskey is closed.The restaurant is in such a cool spot. Yes the strip line does interfere with the view. Try to go after dark to see lights. The service was excellent. The food was awful. I didn't even eat mine. I tried four menu items. My boyfriend ate his steak but agreed it wasn't very good. I hope something changes in regards to the food. I would love to go back if I knew the food was better.Still just average in terms of drinks...but this is a review for the night time crowd.  Very young, as in teenager/high school kids hanging out.....so if you are an adult...you may want to find a different location for socializing in the evening time.On the upside, the place is really nice! A bit of a gem, even. Indoor and outdoor seating it looks like. Well done. And the happy hour everyone praises? Really - it is that good. Very inexpensive and I'd say it makes a visit worth it.

On the downside, there is nothing remarkable about the pizza. I mean, it isn't bad, but you won't be blown away. It's pizza. But like I said, at happy hour it's a great deal for a great experience.

I'll have to try other things on the menu and update my review later.Taste wise 4 star, as the food does taste good, service 4 star the guy working the counter was very nice. I would give an overall of a 4 star, but gave 3 due mainly 2 price, and as good as the food is, u really do not get very much meat with your food. They do give you plenty of rice/beans with your food, a decent amount of plantains, but very little chicken for what they charge. Overall if the price ever drops, I will absolutely go back for sure!Overall the food and service is average. We ordered 

Shrimp with scrambled eggs (shrimp is large, good portion however a little too salty)
String bean with garlic sauce (A-OK)
Preserved veg with pork hot pot (a little too sweet for me besides that it's good)

Con : They charge for steam rice. (My cousin who lived in Vegas says most Chinese restaurant do no charge for steam rice).I placed an order for pickup, but it took me 4-5 tries to get through. Parking is a beast during the week, carry out parking would be nice. 

The staff is friendly and the food is super fresh. The border bowl is big enough to share, so prepare yourself if you order solo.Really nice staff work right I front of this store I wish they had more things but other than that really nice place !This is the place to get cheap drinks while waiting to get into Thunder From Down Under next door. Their happy hour runs all day and includes $2 beer and $5 cocktails. There's hardly anyone here in the evenings too so service is fast. Load up ladies because you'll need it!Pretty interesting place, which has different tasting pancakes. The red velvet was whatevers, but the carrot cake was very unique and pretty good. I opted for the adobo fried rice omelet. It's not that bad.Very good food but i had a very rude waitress. Wish I new her name so I could put it on this review. No tip from meI'd say this 3 star is really more of a 3.5 star but, 1OAK is in Vegas and as such gets graded on a Vegas scale, and to that end, it's just mediocre. I've been here several times, with and without bottle service, and 1OAK  doesn't really stand out. As a club in Vegas, I understand that your drinks are going to be pricey, I accept it, I would however like some vodka in my screwdriver if it's not too much of a hassle. It's also the only club in Vegas where even when I have bottle service I get hassled. I'm paying specifically to not get hassled and to have my own area, but they put the tables so close to one another. This is good if the next group is fun, but sucks when they're buzzkills
The good part of this club though is that even though it's small, it certainly does try. I've seen several people perform here and haven't had any issues with getting in. They also have a semi residency with major lazer, and I love them almost as much as bacon
  The club is also open on Tuesdays, which I like because if I'm in a club mood on Tuesday, I have a place. 
The bottle service here also isn't as expensive as most on the strip and I have gotten a decent amount of comps here. 

My final say is that if this place wasn't in Vegas, like if it was in San Diego or Sacramento it would be the toast of the town, but since it's in Vegas, it becomes just another clubBoth the Shu Mai and Ha Gow had a very strange taste, not bad, just different from the norm. Nice place to eat, give it a shot.This is your typical sports bar. Nothing amazing worth mentioning, but nothing bad either. A good place to go if you want to watch some games or watch some UFC fights.Good food (nachos, sandwiches, appetizers ). Drinks are made decently good most times.. Good cheap shots. I like how they have a HH that starts an hour early (2:00) then the rest of the bars around (3:00). And everyone is always very nice.$5 for parking and located in downtown LV , easy to find and very historical location.

The 3 level museum is full of artifacts about the past! You take the elevator to the top floor and work your way down. It starts with how the Mobsters took over and than at the last level is how it was brought back to its norm. 
There were so much information all over the walls, so much detail everywhere that i understood then why people would buy memberships for the museum. I think it would take well over a whole day before you can fully understand EVERYthing ! 

We pretty much skimmed through this spot and partake in some photo opps and read through some pretty gruesome details of what they did when they "hacked" someone! At the end of it all there was the gift shop, pretty cool spot for some education and fun!This place is good.  We were staying at the Four Seasons and they recommended this place.  i have to say being a NYorker and american italian im pretty picky...and our dishes were  good!  We sat outside because it was a beautiful night..we sat near the outside fireplace...it was very nice!!   Also, the music was very fitting..nice authentic italian music!!  fried calamari..drinks..main dishes were good.  the dessert..cannoli(good for arizona..lol).  fruit dessert in a large martini glass was fantastic!!  Wait staff was excellent..our waiter Chris couldn't have been nicer.  They also gave us(on the house) a glass of Limoncello..which was nice touch!! I would also say dining in AZ is a little earlier so we had to get use to this.   we went around 9pm and it was winding down..so eastcoasters... get to this restaurant and start making it later dining!The place is jam packed with stuff I do not need, but fun to look over.Got Pho here once and it was good!  Also had some tasty chicken wings and eggrolls.

Not sure what's going on inside the restaurant itself, it looks like it used to be a sports bar/party bar and now they serve pho and sushi?  I don't think I'd try the sushi here.

Lots of beers on tap, looks like a great spot for happy hour if you're near the 202 and Scottsdale Road in Tempe.It's a beautiful restaurant. The decor is grade A, classy and dim and sexy. I only went here for lunch, but I'd imagine it's a great date place, especially if your date is shallow like me and gets excited about visually impressive places. You enter and behind the host's table is a whole wall lined with tequila bottles. Really gorgeous.

I can't remember what my husband ordered. I remember we got the mexican corn as an appetizer, and I got a lovely cocktail that had raspberries and champagne in it. Quite delicious. The corn was so so. Better mexican corn can be found at the Black Chile Grill in the Biltmore. It wasn't charred enough, and I think the amazing creaminess from slathered mayo wasn't there. Probably was healthier for you though! My fish tacos were good, but not outstanding. 

In short, a good restaurant, but nothing memorable. Don't go out of your way to enjoy the food there, but don't avoid it either. If you're there shopping, make sure to give it a shot!The taxi drivers don't even know this place changed names to "Elara."  It's still PH Westgate in everyone's minds.  The Hilton name came off of one hotel in Vegas, but they're back with their recent acquisition of Planet Hollywood's extra add-on.  Behold, the new "Hilton Grand Vacations" hotel.

Good things? 
-The hotel is non-smoking.
-The 1 bedroom suite was huge and has a pull-out bed in the living room couch.  We had 10 people in the room, and there was plenty of space. book it through a deal, not through the hilton site.
-DJ spins at the pool on the weekends during the summer, mostly Top 40.
-Central Location on the strip, next to Fat Tuesday and Marquee


Not So Good Things?
-Hard to initially find, parking garage sort of a walk from the front desk.
-Hilton must have some security standard, because they post a guard out by the elevators.  It's pretty useless, as one person having a key can bring in a huge throng of people.  This doesn't keep the partiers (like meeeee) out of your floor.
-Be prepared to shell out $$$ at the poolside bar, a beer is $7.  They conveniently tell you to dump all drinks before going in.  Hm...
-They seem to really be dealing with lots of small problems. Security bugged us to see if we were "doing ok" practically every hour on Saturday (go away, we're busy on vacation).  Calls to concierge desk sometimes do not get recorded.  It's not obvious how to turn your room onto "do not disturb" mode.  They said its because of the "recent switch in ownership," but come on...


Overall, it was whatever.  But really, it's vegas - and a definite step up from dumps like Polo Towers and Imperial Palace.

(DANG I ACTUALLY WROTE A USEFUL REVIEW, +1 ME)They deliver and that made me so happy, but not to be too excited.  My biggest disappointment is the delivery time and how the food appears cold once we receive it. Perhaps, it would be best to just dine it because the food is pretty good. They also totally messed up a food order for delivery, which left one of us with nothing to eat while we waited an additional 45 minutes for the driver to return with correct order.  Bummer!This place is great if you love antojitos Mexicanos  this is the place for you the ice cream is delicious my only pet peeve and why I gave three stars is that they only had two people working and there was a line out the door service just took a really long timeThe ability to sit on the square was really nice with a great view of the square.  The food was solid but not the best Indian I have had in Madison.  Garlic Naan was a bit flat and the dishes were not terribly aromatic or bursting with flavor.  I would come back for sure as it is a nice experience.  Perhaps it was a one off night.  I enjoyed myself and will return at some point.Wings were not bad,I had honey habenero(not hot at all,pass if you want heat) had Cajun hot (def packs some heat) the bad part about it they charge 50 cents to split flavors,wth????.try the fried okra and spicy tator tots awesome.The celery sticks??? went directly to the trash(not worth eating).The wait wasnt long on a thursday prob 15 minutes in and out of the door.Wont be going out of my way for this placeI went to London two summers ago and visited the topshop there. I love their clothing ,accessories and handbags - ALL they had to offer. 
When I came back to the US and realize that they were planning to open on in the west coast I got excited. I've been anticipating it since then. And when I saw that they had opened two weeks ago when I went to vegas I KNEW I had to go. I bugged the hell out of Darren to drive me there since we were staying at the four seasons and its like MILEs away - in vegas length. Darren said yes and hopping for joy I jumped into the car with a grin on my face....

When I got there...
I AM - disappointed. This location does not do the store any justice! This store seemed a little too overly-hipped out with neons and sparkles that it just seemed...not my cup of tea. I really missed the classic/timeless pieces that the one on oxford street had to offer. This was just another 'shop' for me, not the TOPshop I was looking forward to.  Price for things were the same so no difference there.
Walked out with nothing and went to Zara instead.

Maybe next month when I go to vegas again, I'll stop by and have another look.

Hopefully the one opening in the Grove next year will be better. *fingers crossed*Immediately upon entering the building, I was turned off by two things:  1. You have to go through a line with rails like an amusement park.  2.  As you approach the register..still in line.. you have to get your drink at the fountain.  It ends up the people drink what they initially filed up, then trying to go back you fill their cup again.  It was definitely annoying.

I was happy overall with the food.  A few highlights include the salad area & grill.  The salad area has tons of variety, and everything looked fresh.  I was also happy with the steak, as it was cooked to order on the grill.  

My  only problem with the food was the catfish.  While the taste was okay, it was thin & bone-in.  So by the time I pulled the meat away from the bones, there wasn't much left. So I felt it could've been served better.  

I agree with everyone on the cleanliness & service.   Getting refills on drinks and used plates cleared was a problem.  We could never seem to find out server; and other empty tables had plates stacked up for a while before they were cleared.

Food on the floor stayed there almost the entire time we were there, and the "clean" dishes & silverware had spots.  Sure, it's a buffet and I dint expect much, but for a place that is supposed to be a step up, I'd expect a step up.

Overall, I was happy & can see myself returning, but they can certainly improve on things.I really hate to say this. I really do. But the dinner experience I had at GRS was nothing short of underwhelming. 

I had been dying to check out this restaurant, so when a friend suggested a trip to Vegas, I was completely on board. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the main lobster and decided to share. Boy, was that a mistake. While the lobster was good, the portion was absolutely miniscule and in anticipation of a big expensive meal, had practically starved ourselves all day. Moving on. 

For a main course, I ordered the Beef Wellington ('cause obviously I had to). My husband got the epic American Kobe filet. The waiter does come by with a meat cart before you order so you can see the different cuts, which is a nice touch. We also ordered the mac and cheese, haricot vert, and asparagus as sides to share.  

My Beef Wellington? It was fine. Okay. Pretty good. When compared with the amazingness I was expecting (and the price point), "fine" isn't anywhere close to good enough. We got a bearnaise to go along with the Kobe steak, but the fact is, that was its saving grace. The steak itself was incredibly boring. Sure, it was pretty good. It was fine. Not bad. But.... this is a steakhouse. And that's a $75 steak. Seriously? Not good enough, my friend. 

On the other hand--- the sides. Oh my God. OH MY GOD. The mac and cheese was incredible, and I think I could have eaten two buckets of the tempura fried haricot vert. The asparagus was perfect, too. So for that bit of wonderfulness, I'm giving Gordon Ramsay Steak one star for each of those. When I start craving mac and cheese, that's the one I think of. So, so good. 

But guys.... it's a steakhouse. A STEAKHOUSE. With a super boring steak. Yes, it was well cooked. But I've had far better steaks at restaurants one would assume would be inferior. Overall, the meal was a lot of highs and lows. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, since it's one of my favorite things on the planet, but I was really tempted to not order anything else. The toffee pudding I would say was quite good-- 4 out of 5 stars. I really wanted this to be the best meal of my life. It was certainly the most expensive (one appetizer, two entrees, three sides, one dessert, and the least expensive bottle of wine on the menu -- $300). But I refuse to get caught up in the I-paid-a-lot-for-this-so-it-better-be-five-stars trap and be completely honest. 

If you feel you must go to Gordon Ramsay Steak... just order the sides.To: Mr. Ramsay

I love your shows, Hell's Kitchen and Masterchef. You show passion in everything you do. 

Thank you,
Long
--------------------------------

   My wife and I celebrated our special day at Ramsay Steak House in Las Vegas.  First,  I want to say the steaks were amazing and your desserts were to die for( the desserts were free because what had happened).  The waitress who waited on us  was knowledgeable on the steaks  and she knew which beer would go with the dishes. 

   The dinner would have been GREAT, expect for the host who showed us to our table. She took us up in the elevator  to the second level then we walked across the floor.  She then walked us back to the elevator and told us to wait in front of the elevator.  After 2 minutes standing there, she came back and took us down stairs to our table. 

   Mr. Ramsay,  please understand, if I was at a 1 star or 2 stars restaurant I can understand about the miscommunication about where to seat your customers.  I was disappointed and sad for what happened on our special night. My wife and I were looking forward to your 5 stars restaurant but it fell short to our expectation.  I paid $615.65 for 3 people so I think I have the right to expect GREAT service ALL around service. Don't you think?

   I know you are a world class chef: restaurateur and television personality, awarded 15 Michelin stars in total and currently holds 14. Maybe you should slow down and check up on your restaurants... 

#1 - first impression is the front desk...
#2 - second is the table...
#3 - the food and service...A brewery in the Scottsdale/ Paradise Valley area? Surely you jest.

It's true! AND its kind of hidden in the middle of a ritzy strip mall. When you walk into this place, it looks nothing like a brewery- the decor is very bistro.

We enjoyed their beer, and their happy hour menu is different, but good.

The service was great at first. But the later it got, the busier it got, and it seemed like our waitress was the only one working. We spent about an hour trying to flag her down for our check.

The food was great. I had the chicken pesto sandwich, while tasty, gave me a bit of food poisoning. The rest of our group enjoyed their eats: the "famous" meatballs, burgers, and pizza. And they were all fine.

If you go, dont be surprised that its not your typical brewery, and stay AWAY from the chicken.Luke warm chai tea. Nothing special. Its like drinking steamed milk. Starbucks' is much better for the same price.Very nice staff and service. Very low key place. Never had pupusas before so decided to try it. I thought it was more like a flour tortilla. It seems more like a thick corn tortilla which I personally do not care for. We tried the mixed option. They were somewhat tasty but I just did not care for the corn texture. Beans were runny. They were also a bit on the greasy side but that may be how it is supposed to be.Service 4/5 - Lets start with the service. The service was decent. They checked on us on regular intervals. They were very polite and they asked to refill our drinks regularly.

Food 2/5 - I had ordered a tamago nigiri, beef carpaccio, one of their rolls, and stole some tempura off of a friend's boat. The rice on the roll felt underwhelming. The texture, and temperature of the rice didn't give me the impression of good craftsmanship. The flavor of the rice was okay. That being said, the sushi was okay. The beef carpaccio tasted pretty good. The texture didn't give me the impression of carpaccio though. Overall the food was okay for the price.

Drinks 5/5 - of the Drinks I wanted, the nigori sounded good and the calpico sounded fun, so I had both. Should have made it for happy hour because it seemed like it would have encouraged me to drink more. The drinks came chilled and they had a nice way of topping off my meal. Kudos to alcohol lol.For the time being, I need to adjust the rating here because of two issues which I have found to be uncommon here. First, I was waiting for about 7 minutes while the employees were busy in the middle of a conversation (in espinol) despite seeing me waiting to order at the counter. Second, both items I got were not fresh, the dessert item was actually stale and crusty and should have been discarded (tasted like refrigerated birthday cake from last week).Vegas pizza places can be broken down into 4 tiers. 
Tier 1: Settebello, Grimaldi's, Old School Pizzeria
Tier 2: Metro Pizza, Rosati's. 
Tier 3: Sunset Pizzeria, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut
Tier 4: Little Caesars or places that make DiGiorno Frozen Pizza look good.

After 1 visit to Bistro I'm having a hard time putting them in my Tier 2 category. For one thing when I called they were out of garlic knots and cheese sticks. I was told it would be 45 minutes to have new ones ready. I'm sorry but I call bs on this one. Case in point, Benny Blancos on Capitol Hill in Denver is open from 11 am to 3 am and has always, ALWAYS had garlic knots available. Old School Pizzeria in NLV on Craig Road: Chef Gio has NEVER been out of garlic knots. And these are places that do some hella business. In short, not buying the excuse, try again. 

We ordered mozzarella sticks for the kids, and two pizzas. Pizza #1 was a Pepperoni with one half having ham and pineapple. The crust was soft, kinda chewy. The ham had good flavor, but when the kids picked the pineapple off the slices we knew something was amiss. A quick taste had me wondering where they got their pineapple as it didn't taste anywhere close to fresh or even well packed in a can. 

My pizza had sausage, ham, tomatoes, and black olives. Bistro's sausage is definitely a cut above much of the stuff I've found in Vegas to date. The ham was great. Overall...not bad. 

Sauce wise everyone liked it...but we didn't get people raving over it like they do with Metro's stuff. And these pizzas were not overly greasy. Even with all the pepperoni it didn't look like it was swimming in grease like Metro's pizza's do. 

Service: Kind of aloof. It's hard to explain and maybe it was because I wasn't having a good day but the man I talked to at the counter was not the most friendly person. There was also the issue of he almost sent a pizza out the door with the sheet of wax paper sticking halfway out the side. He saw this and reboxed the pizza but do it right the first time and you won't be wasting boxes. 

Overall: 3 Stars. We will try them again but the garlic knots excuse flat out won't fly with me, ever. If other pizza places can get it done...I can't give Bistro a free pass on it.Food good, but lost a star when our unnamed server took our drink order and never delivered it. We were excited to try the beer flights, and he brought our wedge salads divided in half, as we had requested, and we finished and still did not have our beer flights.  Finally my wife got up and went to the bar and the bartender delivered the flights. I had the Study Abroad flight, which included the Belgians, and my wife had the Light of the Moon flight, which were lighter wheats.  Cute little muglets but we both felt they had been sitting for awhile because they were not cold.  Entrees came, and I had ordered Pork Two Ways, which included a delicious charred chop (I love charred pork!) and a generous helping of spicy chile verde pork stew, served with fried egg on top and buttered tortillas.  Stack was a little hard to manipulate.  My wife had the seared scallops with corn two ways with bacon and they were tasty. Food exceeded the brews.  Unnamed server (Jeff on the receipt) redeemed himself by comping the extremely tardy beers, but had to leave it at three stars after this unforgivable faux pas.This review will be short and sweet. The room has an intimate feel to it. You got small, round tables surrounded by 4 chairs spread all around the room. There is a bar at back for you alcoholics. The comedians they showcase are better than average. Everybody has their own brand of comedy and the audience is usually mixed. If you didnt come here to have a good time, then you're in the wrong place buddy. Go watch Criss Angel if you wanna waste your money and complain.The ambiance is good. Sangria was good too. But we were a big party and sitting on a big table. I asked for a salsa refil, the server picked one off our table, turned around and handed it over to me. I was thinking of giving 4 stars, but just 3 for now!Although it is a new convenient location for items, they mark up all the prices making their products a rip off. I would recommend going to the ABC store in Planet Hollywood. At least the ABC prices are still reasonable unless you don't care about being ripped off.Certainly decent place.

This place recently opened and its a 24 hour diner.  
This is a little Mom and Pop Cafe type feel. Reminds me of TTT in Tucson. 

The waitress was working by herself and there were about 4 other parties in there but it didn't stop her from paying attention to our party of 8. She did really well.

The food was good, it was diner quality. Nothing amazing but it was decent.

Certainly worth the stop if you are looking for a cheap, good meal. 
However do not mistake the quality of food for 5 star.We went here for a night out as a family, and let me start by saying that the chocolate fountain is amazing! We splurged and got 4 different flavors of Gelato - dulce de leche, creme brulee, oreo, and mint. The Gelato was truly delicious, however not the absolute best I have ever had. The service on the other hand was horrible... Truly the worst service I have had in a very long time. We are a friendly family and when we greeted the woman with a "Hello! How's your evening going?" we got a blank stare... Then when we asked if we could try a couple samples she genuinely rolled her eyes at us. May I add that we were the only people in line as this time. The only words she spoke to us were to tell us our total and even then we didn't get any eye contact. I hope that she was just having an "off night" but she made me feel like I was a terrible inconvenience on her evening.Patio seating was really nice for our reservation at 8. Not too hot. 

Took about 15 min before someone came and wiped down our table and took our drink orders, so that was a negative. 

The Mrs had the caprese and it was a little bland. Crabcakes were pretty solid. Didn't get an entree because of the appetizers. Desserts were really good. The creme puffs and chocolate ice cream with cocoa powder were both excellent. 

Didn't go into the Lam showroom. 

All in all a decent experience but nothing special.oh dear, i hope i'm not going to become hated by all the cake lovers and bakeries in edinburgh, but hear me out before i'm you start to boo me.

my visit here was due to a birthday cake afternoon celebration and it was lucky that the plan was only to come for cake because that was the only option.  seriously, they have no soup, sandwiches, salads, or other savoury delights that help take the edge off the sugar rush.  i was actually quite glad i'd eaten a quick lunch before going.  they did have one savoury scone, but that would hardly do if someone had come with the intention of having a small lunch with a slice of cake.  a bit disappointing and with a shop so large i'm not sure why they don't offer the savoury options....

so a bit disappointed by the lack of savoury options, but i have to say the cakes looked seriously impressive.  what i did like about this place was the variety of cake and brownie options that were a bit different than the normal.  they had a chocolate cake, but they also had an orange and rosemary cake and a ginger and rose cake.  they also had carmel chocolate brownies and parmesan and sundried tomato scones and some other delights that i fail to remember so many days later.

i was also rather impressed with their tea choices.  the normal breakfast blend but also a lovely violet black tea that was thoroughly enjoyable.  the tea was served in lovely tea cups with an extra flask of hot water for top ups.  very convenient and appreciated from a chain tea drinker like me!  seriously, i can never just have one cup...

now the cakes and this is where the three star rating was confirmed.  my orange and rosemary cake was delightlful.  it was orange-y and had a hit of rosemary but as i neared the end of the slice it got rather sugary.  i think this came from the frosting and it might have been nice if there was a bit more rosemary to cut through the sweetness.  i also tried a small forkful of the caramel chocolate brownie and oh dear, did someone accidently add an extra bag of sugar to this???  it was so incredibly sweet that my tiny forkful gave me a sugar rush and a bit of a tummy ache at the same time.  i also think the enamel on my teeth started to dissolve from the huge sugar hit.  poor Kelly F couldn't even finish it after passing it around for everyone to taste. 

i know people like cakes and brownies and other sweet things but the greatest disappointment of lovecrumbs was how overly sugary everything seemed.  i just can't eat cake that tastes like i'm only eating a bag of sugar with a tiny hint of another flavour.  so i don't think i'll be making a return visit unless i'm told things are less sugary....I am very excited to eat here because a friend told me how great it was, walked in and had high hopes. LOVED the ambiance of the decor, full bar, lots to choose from on the menu and the staff was super friendly, and they had diet coke which for us is a BIG deal.

They brought out bread and an olive oil/vinegar which was good, I ordered a pasta dish which was good but not amazing, I am not a big lover of tangy sauce but I ate it. My Boyfriend ordered a chicken and artichoke calzone which looked awesome when it came out but after cutting into it the cheese had not melted inside, so we sent it back. When the waitress came back, she apologized and handed him a clearly nuked in the microwave calzone which was now chewy and sad looking and said she had the cook make him another one to take with him. Although it was a nice thing to do, he didnt really care for this dish and after explaining that she offered him something else. Again, the staff was great so that wasnt the issue at all. They got him a spaghetti and meatball plate, he too ate it and felt the sauce was a bit tangy. 

When the bill came out, she did not charge us for his meal, and that impressed me, because I expected to pay for at least the spaghetti and meatballs for him as well as my dish. This showed me they want to make their customers happy and because of this I will give them another shot in the future.The food here is really good! Mitch our server was fantastic. However it's very loud and very crowded. All the employees were very nice but we were seated next to a table with unruly children that the parents didn't care to look after. I would definitely order take out though!A little pricier than where I am from but fast and efficient service. They also have tons of colors to choose from and are well staffed. This trip I only got a gel overlay on my nails, I'll definitely be back.I've been into the Ventoux a few times now and I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still not 100% sure what the bar is meant to be. Half of me wants it to turn into an apres-velo style bar where the road clubs will turn up to on a sunday, where I can head after a solid mash on the bike or at the gym and have some hearty food a pint and perhaps a espresso. However it's not that .... yet. ....

The beers are solid with a good selection of different beers from around germany and europe. They also have the classic Edinburgh selection of lagers and bitters with a few surprises. They have a decent selection of spirits. They also have crisps. 

One of the good things they've done since they took over from the illicit still is to get rid of the enormous TV which was the worst thing that had happened to bars in the last century.

The space in general REALLY works as a bar. I appreciate the tables, the standing space, the way it works as a bar. However it still feels like it's just not quite there yet. I think that in a few years it'll figure itself out and THAT it will be a better bar.This spot is great had a little trouble checking in as the system went down right when we got there, the free breakfast from 6-9am made up for the lost time will be checking out all the other spots that offer free breakfast for now on now that i know they exsistNeeds renovation for sure, especially given its history.  Gary Selesner, head of the hotel for 4 years now has virtually renovated everything.  He will get to this in time, and when he will, it will be the best in town. Because most people walk past it to get to the FORUM SHOPPS, its one of the strip's best spots for people watching, PERIOD. Bathrooms are close as is the poker room, and Munch Bar for food and snacks.  You can do better, and you can do worse. Lot of screens.First time in, the staff wasn't really very welcoming, didn't get a hello or anything and they both looked at me when I walked in.  The clothes are okay just way WAY overpriced and considering the lack of acknowledgement I wasn't really down to spend any money in the store.The coffees and frozen drinks are very good. The yogurt was premade, so the granola was mushy.I used to love this place. It had been a few months since I ate here before today. But today....
1. I couldn't have my eggs the way I wanted them on my plate "We don't substitute"
2. I get 1, ONE napkin. I finally have to ask if they can spare an extra napkin or two. 
3. I get charged for sour cream

Not sure if I'll come backI was excited upon seeing a lively rustic chic lounge/bar/dining room. Atmosphere and service were great all-around but there was a noticeable gap between appetizers and entrees.  Of the appetizers, the scallop (one) stood out and the tender squid was fantastic. I'd pass on the dry meatballs. The bacon sounded good but I didn't try it; I just heard the crisp from the other end of a large table. 

Entrees were meh. Portions were tiny for the price. My filet was overcooked and the meat was tough to cut into. Salmon portion was also laughable and I noticed four differently-sized pieces on four plates. I'm sure they go by weight over shape/size but still, perception trumps reality. The red velvet cake I had was dry and bland. Among the worst I've had for the price.  

Halfway through dinner, a live DJ starting spinning house tracks. I don't think it fit the restaurant vibe and average age of patrons. I found it slightly off-putting and made it difficult to hear my dinner party. Another tip: park next door at NM (one minute walk) for free and avoid the valet. 

Overall: another "celebrity"-chef hype failing to meet expectations. Avoid bedtime texts with dining partners about how hungry y'all still are. Spend the same amount elsewhere for a much more satisfying, and filling, meal.3 stars: A-OK.

It's thin crust pizza from a chain restaurant. 

Claim to fame is the coal burning oven.

This particular location is in the mall. 

If you've ever lived in NYC, you'll wonder what the fuss is about. 

If you've ever lived in Chicago, you'll complain that the pizza is paper thin. 

They have pizza and beer, how can you go wrong - so long as the pizza is hot and the beer is cold, it's just fine.

They have TVs inside, they email coupons for your birthday if you sign up on the website, they aim to please. 

You can't really go wrong.

If you think you're going to have life changing pizza inside fashion show mall, there's something wrong with you.Had never been to one of these places before.  Have to say the ambiance is like hooters with a rock climbing wall inside of it.  I guess anyone can climb it if they feel like it, we saw several people doing it. Different form of entertainment.  The waitress wear the minimum clothing requirement (which hubby loved of course).  Its got a lot of TV's for the sports fans and food was actually fresh and decent, although I think a bit pricey for a burger joint.As gyms go this one is ok.  What bugs me the most is the hidden fees.  There's an annual "maintenance" fee of $29.99 they collect automatically in June.  When you sign up they collect the last month and first month and "initiation fee", each at $10.00 for a total of $30.00 due at sign up.  If you cancel early (before your 1 yr contract automatically renews at $5.00 increase to $15.00/month), you will have to pay $25.00 "processing fee".  And you can ONLY cancel within 60 days of your auto renewal date.  Discount = hidden fees.  Sick of being nickel and dimed to death.Ate at this place a few days ago.  I ordered lasagna and my wife ordered a burger.  The food was good, but not great.  Although the lasagna was well priced at  $16 we felt the Burger $15 was a little much.  As was stated in an earlier review the interior was very spacious and has a bar.  We were there about  7pm on a Saturday and there were only three tables occupied  (including ours).  I did like that the menu was only one page long, so it wasn't like I was reading a bookUnder new management as of January 2014.  Sparse food menu (oatmeal was the pre-packaged, add-water-to-the-paper-cup).  Fruit plate was very generous for just $2: sliced half apple, half an orange, half a pear, 3 strawberries, and a handful of grapes.  I ordered a soy latte and it was strong - I hesitate to review as I'm trying to wean off sugary coffees so unfair to rate.  Ordered a tea and it was GIGANTIC and a bagged organic type out of a box.  WiFi was still available.  They left the shop doors open all morning which made it chilly inside.  Single staff person meant a wait if more than one customer at a time.  Very few power sources so bring a full battery.  It was a good place to kill time, but left me hungry.i forgot this place was here and drove by , decided to grab some breakfast i went with moms pancakes 2 ridiculously big cakes good item to split between 2/3 people and i also ordered the sausage side 2 unexciting pattys of sausage (pass)place is country quaint not my style of decor, service was goodI haven't been to a Sizzler in a long time. This review is for the Salad Bar only. The salad was fresh and ample variety of fixins. The hot dishes, chicken was dry...too long sitting out, not one single piece was eatable. Skimpy on the soups and tacos.  Overall at best 2.5 stars.....I would say try it out but be ready for a little more grease than necessary.  Basically the food is good but not if you are anywhere close to wanting to eat decent/healthy :).
This will be a place that we do not go frequently but maybe every once in awhile when we need a good burro/burrito.To be honest, if I didn't have a friend that tends bar here, I probably never would have gone. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and since its less than a mile from my home Pub (Tim Finnegan's) I have little reason to stop in.

When I did, it was exactly what I expected. Lots of TVs with sports on, decent beer selection and "meh" food. I will be honest, the wings at Tim Finnegan's are better, which is sad considering that is kind of Buffalo Wild Wing's staple menu item.

The other challenge is that this and the new Olive Garden building are in a... less nice part of Metrocenter circle, right next to 2 cheap motels. Good if you wanna score crack or a prostitute, bad if you want your car to be safe in the lot after dark. 

If you wanna watch a game in a chain restaurant, this is the place. If you wanna hang out in a bar with some personality, drive a mile south.I wanted to like this place more, but I think they are having some growing pains.  They were out of Dr. Pepper and Sprite, 2 of the 6 drinks on the fountain.  So, when I wanted a refill, but not of iced tea, I was annoyed to find the only 2 drinks on the fountain I like gone.  The owner was nice enough to give me a Dr. Pepper out of the chill case, but still.  Also, we were told that sandwiches were not available at all, as many others have noted.  We were there for mac n cheese anyway, but this is a further example of the growing pains.

My wife had the cheesy mac.  This was solid, but not great.  It was very sparse on the blue cheese flavor, which was the main reason she ordered it.  Overall, bland.  Did have a very nice crust on the top.

Mine was much better, I had the bayou.  The crab and crawfish flavor was really noticeable.  I could have used more spice, I added red pepper flakes at the table.  The top was nicely crusted, but the middle of my dish remained cool.  I had to take it up to get more heat on it.  I'm assuming this occurred because the seafood was cold, so it made getting the entire dish to temperature take longer.  They were really nice about it, and heated it quickly, so no harm no foul.

We'll give Mix n Mac another try, but hopefully they work out some of these issues sooner rather than later.  I think once they do, it will be a solid place.I'm an Northwest guy, having lived outside of Portland and Seattle for maybe nine years.  So when my brother got tired of the overcast skies and moved to the greater Phoenix area, I decided it was a great chance to get some sun myself.

We saw the review for Johnny Rockets and couldn't pass up the onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.

On the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).

I ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.

Now my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.

Last thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.

And btw, I don't know what was wrong with our jukebox, cause I could not get Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise to play.  They other songs worked, but why not Jimmy Buffet? :-)The menu is super exciting. The music sexy.  This would be a 5 star review. The food is effing amazing. I need a moment with my lamb. 
The service, well.....

1. I didn't order wine, please remove my glasses
2. Bubbly & a cocktails shouldn't take long. Did you go to France to get my bubbles? Are you growing the trees for the oranges?  Don't tell me that the bar got busy. The table sat after us got their drinks quickly. And they had wine & a cocktail. Hmmmm 
3. Don't try to give me bread plate to "prepare me for possible slow kitchen".  

Thankfully the excellent food was delivered promptly. Still service is lacking, except for the bus boy. He was prompt.Tried this place on the basis of one review (usually I prefer more) and liked it! Since I stopped by here before work I only had a chance to try a few things. I wound up picking the bag of macaroons and a chocolate and orange cake called the croqueline.

The cake was light and moist, the orange and chocolate paired well together as the powder on top of the cake added texture to the cake's softness. However I can't say I enjoyed the macaroons. I've only tried them at two other places (Bouchon and Patisserie Manon) and I was disappointed that theirs tasted similar to the cheap sugar cookies at the grocery stores. I bit into the orange and pistachio one inside the bag (there was also chocolate, but I didn't bite into that one yet) and the filling wasn't very rich in flavor. I expected the color to remind me of the flavor (orange=orange, mint green=pistachio). Next time I'll pass on the macaroons, but I'll try their other selections!The women who did my nails and pedicure were AWESOME!  However, I have not returned because the quality wasn't as good as I would have liked for the prices they charge.  The good:  they are open late, which is good for people who don't get off work before 7pm.  The ladies, as stated before, were super nice!  The pedicure I received was good, but nothing to write home about and at an average of $15 more than the average pedicure, I expected more.  There aren't massage chairs, but just a bench seat and while the view is cool at night (you can see the strip), it just wasn't comfortable. 

The girl who did my full set was super sweet and was admittedly "working on getting better" at doing nails.  I got gel and decorative rhinestones. I had to go back a couple days later and have another girl fix them because two of them didn't have the gel smooth finish (she forgot to put alcohol on them and I didnt know thats all I had to do) and then take the rhinestones off and paint another color because the stones had already fallen off.  The girl who did the fixing didn't charge me, which I thought was cool.

Overall the salon is clean and the decor is cute.  As another reviewer has stated, I want to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, but the quality in relation to the cost will keep me from returning.Better than a solid burger, for sure-  I've been to a couple of Smash burgers, but this is first time for Smash Fries--Unbelievable!Good times, great beers, but again , the VIP section was lacking.
Seems like we paid extra to have access to clean bathrooms for the first hour.

The bands were excellent!!
Detailed update soon!!I got the bowl [which comes with guacamole, blak beans, rice, salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema] and for the meats I chose Barbacoa and carnitas. I wasn't expecting much for the quantity, the quality is average. Didn't have much meat in my bowl. If you're looking for airport food that'll satisfy your hunger for an hour or two, get what I got! Good for those who don't want to be on the plane with a full stomach. =]Pretty incredible for airport food.It was a bit of the good, the bad, and the ugly at this festival. There was wrestling, bounce houses, trash everywhere, lots of tacos, and lots of tequila sounds like one fun party to me.  As a first year event, I was impressed.  
The Good:
*The taco quality was impressive for a festival and the concept is fantastic.  My favorite that I tried was Barrio Cafe's spare rib taco.  My least favorite was the grasshopper taco but I was thrilled that I didn't spend a lot to try it and had the chance to try it. The side cart items like street corn fantastic!
*A portion of the proceeds benefit Waste Not a charity delivering food to 100 agencies.
*They had some kid activities. Face painter Daisy was fantastic.
*I left with a stack of coupons and a list of places I want to try.  
*The price was very fair, not sure how the VIP patrons felt.  We went average Joe and enjoyed the festival.
*People were having fun.
The Bad:
*The location of a dirt parking lot and little shade was not ideal.
*Pay another face painter the line was way too long.  She was very good but one more possibly two would have been great.
*The layout of the vendors needs more space between them and if you put them in a U make sure there is plenty of space between them!
The Ugly:
*Vendors ran out of food.
*Trash was everywhere b/c there wasn't enough trash cans.
*The "CONTEST" was lost.  I had no idea who, when, or where they were judging and that could have been entertaining.Remember in The Office when, in preparation for David Wallace's cocktail party, Michael Scott asked Pam to smell his breath but then Dwight volunteered and responded, "Good not great"?  Well that's exactly how I feel after eating here for lunch today.

Buttered calamari wasn't too bad, soft shell crab was par and the dipping sauce for it was delightful, but the main reason I came here was for the sushi Love Boat For Two for me.  The Love Boat sounded awesome because it's 9 pieces of sashimi, 8 pieces of nigiri, and a Hawaii roll (8 pieces) SERVED. ON. A. BOAT.

I'm on a boat!  I'm on a boat!  Take a good hard look at the mothafuckin boat!

The price is $30.95 which isn't bad, except for two things to consider:
1. The quality & taste isn't anywhere near as good as Sakana Sushi.
2. At Sakana, you can get 12 pieces sashimi for $12.45, which is a far superior deal since the pieces are cut larger.

I almost gave two stars because I was under the impression that I'd be getting dessert with the Love Boat but apparently the website is a fan of promoting LIES!  Not a total dealbreaker, but consider yourself warned.I purposely wait to go to new restaurants so they can work out the kinks, but I guess I didn't wait long enough.  I understand why there is a wait for tables.  Not because everyone has flocked there, but because they don't serve you once you get to the table.  We sat down and waited several minutes to be greeted, which was marginal.  After our waiter took our drink order, we didn't see him for more than 10 minutes.  After he took our food order, he never spoke to us again.  Random people brought us food, plates, our bill.  It was weird.  One friend described the wait as "hostile."  

We had the cheese pizza.  My daughter loved it.  It was okay.  I thought it was soggy in the middle.  We also got the corn coins.  I'm not sure corn on the cob is improved by putting a pound of cheese on it, but the corn was cooked awesome.  

It is a cool place and fun to hang out.  Just don't go if you are actually hungry or want to talk to a waiter.Giving this place 3 stars because the decor rocked, our server guy was sweet, and the cheese platter and wine was actually pretty good. Alas, I don't know if I can get myself to come back to a place that talks bad about its customers right in front of them. No wonder the place was empty. First of all, there is a bar and restaurant section, it was the middle of the day and we had our 6 months old daughter with us, naturally we sat in the restaurant section. The bartender girl had the nerve to give us the stink eye the entire time and say out loud "bringing a crying baby to a wine bar". Our child didn't cry once and I thought this area was nice enough for staff not to have ghetto attitude and manners towards their customers. Shame.I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars, but will give 3 since we probably just came at an "off" time. I bought a Groupon, $30 for $10, plus it was a weekend when Groupon had a $5 off promotion, so I only paid $5. 
We stopped by at 7:30pm and played pool at 1 of the 2 pool tables. Maybe there are more pool tables somewhere else, but when I think pool hall, I envision a room full of pool tables. Anyway, I think it was $12.99/hr. They had a couple of beer pong tables too.
We also had the nachos, which were ok, but nothing spectacular for $12. Add one Sprite and a water and that used up the $30. I guess that's not too bad. 
The whole time there were only a few other people in there, but as we were leaving there were a bunch of girls around the bar waiting for the male review. I would expect it to be a little more crowded on a Friday night, but like I said, we were there at 7:30 so we were probably early.
So I guess somewhere between meh and a-ok is fitting. This might be a fun place to go with a big group before heading somewhere else.
*Edit* I forgot to mention they offer bottle service! Uh, seriously? Someone's going to pay $150 for a bottle of vodka at this place? I don't think so. I know it's Vegas, but come on!!Best spot for beer pong and hanging out.  Kind of reminds me of a college bar.  Usually always empty, so better to bring a big group to start the fun.  Honestly, after O'sheas got knocked down this place is the only spot to go for BP.There has been so much hype about this place that I could not wait to try it out with my girlfriends for dinner.
The decor is adorable, very rustic chic. It's open and airy even when it got packed. One of my girlfriends and I arrived early for pre-dinner drinks at the bar. The service was a bit slow but very nice. I ordered a delicious vodka mint drink and she a strawberry prickly pear one. Mine was the better of the two by far. We were promptly seated at 7 and the waiter was quick to take our appetizer order. The table shared teh Charcuterie & Cheese platter and it was delicious if not a bit expensive at $21. The blue cheese with the honeycomb was divine and the marcona almonds were wonderful, a new favorite for sure. Service slowed at this point, while it was getting busy it was not so packed that we should have to wave down our waiter. My sister and I split the duck salad (called My Wife's favorite salad), it was delicious though the pieces of lettuce were a bit large in my opinion. We also split the waygu burger which was one of the specials. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bacon jam and egg really were a wonderful combination. The homemade chips were lovely and not too greasy. One of the girls in our party had the brick oven chicken and she was pleased with the chicken as well as the mac & cheese it was served with. By the time we were ready for dessert service had slowed considerably as the restaurant had filled up some more. It really seemed to get busy the later in the evening it got. We decided to get four different desserts and split them. The Brookie (a brownie cookie combination) was ok but I would not order it again. The triple layer cake was moist and had a really good flavor and the ganache was perfectly done. The two favorites were the apple pie in a bag which was devoured and the bread pudding. The best thing on the desserts however was the caramel salt ice cream, I wish I could have purchased a gallon to take home. 

I am only giving this restaurant three stars because it is so pricey for what you get. I have no problem spending money on good food and good it was but it was $30 good not $65 per person good.Great menu selection with both south and north Indian menu items.  Enjoyed the dosas we've had so far, and some of the curries are different than what you find at most Indian restaurants in town - for example I'm digging the Chana Saag.  

Service can be extremely slow sometimes which seems to be common at Indian restaurants.  Their spice levels are pathetically weak.  Hot is just not very hot.  Minor complaint I have concerns their plates because the artwork on them actually looks like dirty food stains until you take a closer look.  Can't get over it.The service was AMAZING!!!  The food is decent, however agree that if you want something exotic you will need to leave the confines of Gilbert ;)  The lunch portions are huge, and my husband and I paid approx $20 (including tip) for two lunch specials and two sodas.....really good value.

We will be back.I know it is opening weekend PLUS Memorial Day weekend but 3.5 hours to get inside even with a guest list??? You've got to be kidding me. There are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out to smooth out this whole waiting in line process. Hopefully all of the staff will just get better with time!

I enjoyed the huge LED back wall behind the DJ. I also enjoyed the Cirque du Soleli performers that were behind the DJ too. Sebastian Ingrosso was another plus. However, the overall layout of the club isn't the greatest, even with the huge dance floor on the bottom. Despite having this large main dance area, the club is still small, compared to Marquee and XS. I wish there was an outdoor area too!

Also, they really need to fix the bass because when my friends and I reached the front of the stage, our ear drums felt like they were going to fall off because it was overly intense!! Sure, we want to hear a good bass sound but this was way too much. Now I understand why no one was standing that close to the stage. Even standing a little further back in the crowd did not help. 

Overall, the club has some nice features inside and some really popular DJs on their line up, which would be the sole reason for my return. Otherwise, I think I would rather stick to Marquee or XS, my favorite clubs.This was a ridiculous experience from start to finish. And the only reason they get the third star is because we had absolutely the most fantastic adorable and aware cocktail waitress.  We went for Skrillex, who rocked!! And the cirque theme is suuuuuper fun and unique.  
However, the hosts are a bunch of professional scammers who take tips and tell you they will help you get a good deal on a table when they actually never do anything close to helping.  
And the club is full of cheap scandalous hoes who will loiter around table and then try to grab drinks off the table and run.Granted I went when it just opened up, I thought it was great but the parking situation sucks!About 10 days ago I gave Jenni a try.  
- I had the Pho Special, it was ok.  For what I got it seemed pricey compared to Pho at other Vegas places.
- I will give them props for having a nice decor/restaurant and cool, open-view kitchen that makes it easy to see the cooks in action.  Service was also excellent.
- I value food over ambiance so I'll probably stick with my tried-&-true Viet eateries or give other places a shot.Dear Chef Ramsay, are we not worthy?  

Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.

The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.

The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.

The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.

Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!

Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.

The dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by décor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.  

If you're wearing a t-shirt that says "I love Las Vegas" go right on in.  This is your kind of place.Food was 4 stars, service a paltry 1 star. I ate lightly, just a bowl of English Onion soup which was fantastic and a side of the mac & cheese which was above average, but not the best I've ever had. Main problem was the service. Even though we had 3 different servers waiting on us, they were all incompetent. Splitting a bill 3 ways shouldn't take 30 minutes which it took for them because they kept screwing it up. Improve the service and you might be looking at a 4 star restaurant.Good location but needs better signage for sure... came here during HH, nice $5 wine list, the worst calamari plate I've ever had... it was basically a plate of deep fried bread crumbs with nothing in & way too much olive oil drizzled on the veggies.
Ordered some pasta from the dinner menu... super blend, didn't even finish 1/3 of the plate. Nice, cozy place tho, just don't come here with an empty stomach.Definitely heard great things! Decided to check it out. To my surprise.. It wasn't as good as people had said. Fries were SUPER salty.. And not
To mention the burger as well. Ordered the jalapeño poppers and surprise surprise
ALL of them had seeds in them! (Only one Is suppose to have seeds according to what the server told us). They did get our drink order wrong but we were approached by the manager which was concerned about our experience. Overall, good place. But I've had better.I think it was a good burger, but as is the case for all restaurants in LV, way overpriced. Given all the new burger places popping up around the country, its just not worth it. Shake Shack is better, cheaper, and more fun. But when in Vegas, you have little choice. Service was quick and pleasant.Saturday brunch is around $45 with fees.  For $45 in vegas the food better be special.  While the selection is vast and the service is excellent, the food wasn't as good as I expected.  
The good:  the fried chicken, prime rib and lobster bisque were great.  The gelato was also very, very good.   

The bad:  the sushi was tastless and dry, the Chinese offerings seemed to be over heated, maybe warmed up too long because no one was eating it.  Eggs benedict was dry the muffin tough.

The ugly:  the snow crab is served both steamed and chilled (nice) but the crab pieces were very scrawny, a really skinny legs without much meat.  I haven't ever seen such skinny offerings ever at a buffet.

Special note: there is a selection of all you can drink alcoholic beverages(beer /wine) but if you don't drink a lot it's a non-benefit.

Overall, not worth the $45 price point.  Something in the mid to low $30s would have been reasonable, even cutting out the alcohol. It might be a fair deal for a weekday lunch.Got the berry mimosa...yummm...and the wolfpack with goat cheese, eggs ever easy and country gravy...seriously delicious. Huge portions so be prepared to share! Cute diner feel and the staff was very friendly :) Will need to come back to sample the rest of the menu!Nice option in the area for light, quick meal options. Portions are on the small side while they don't skimp on the price. Taste is unremarkable but the ingredients seem quite fresh.The music outside is loud and plays constantly it finally stopped late in the night. Bed is clean, linens are white, with down alternative filling. Not centralized air, unit in the room functions well though. Tub/shower has shelves for your products. For the most part, at this time, most of the decisions and furniture are old from the Imperial Palace era. But there is obvious construction happening throughout the hotel/casino. I have high hopes for vast improvements. The signs within the resort to find valet, are confusing and the staff further exacerbated the confusion because they too, didn't know where the valet was. Check in line was long and slow. Took 40 minutes to get a room key card. For now, until the re-vamp is done, I give this place a 6.5/10. But it was a very affordable rate on NASCAR weekend. (I didn't attend that)Hmmm, this one is difficult, parts impressed, parts just fell flat, descent burger, not so good fries, not a place I would go out of my way for.I tried the Longhorn Steakhouse for the first time recently and had a very uneven experience. Being a steakhouse you would think the steaks would be their strong point, but instead it was their weakness.

First off I will say the service was excellent. Very attentive waiter, the manager came by to check on us (although he did so before we got our food) and the hostess was very nice and accommodating as well.

For an appetizer we had the Wild West Shrimp. It was stellar! Deep fried popcorn shrimp with sliced banana peppers and garlic served with homemade ranch dressing. Definitely the highlight of the meal!

My dinner came with a salad that was nothing special, but definitely not bad. I wasn't there for a side salad though and it was perfectly acceptable.

For dinner I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and asked for it to be cooked medium. It came medium rare, bordering on rare. It was also the second worst cut of filet that I have ever had (the worst coming on a cruise ship). It was chewy and had two big strings of gristle. 

For dessert I had the s'mores brownie which was very good.

So basically, go there for appetizers and dessert and skip the steak.

Oh, but they do make their own steak sauce at your table that was quite good. Too bad the steak sucked.i bought a Groupon to check out this eatery. it is very close to my house. we ordered: Eggplant rolitini w/angel hair and cream sauce, "Big Tuna" Sub Sandwich with onion rings, and Calzone with mushrooms, blk olives, onions,&bell pepper mix. total : $33.50 w/tax.the eggplant rolitini is not the best. very rubbery,stuffed with ricotta cheese, smothered in red sauce to mask the blandness. the angel hair with cream sauce is edible.the Calzone is about the size of a folded Pizza Hut personal pizza. the ingredients inside were plenty and very good. it is good;but, not the best. Sicily's Pizza on Durango has the biggest(12" !!) and best Veggie Calzones . the "Big Tuna" did not really have much tuna salad in it at all to warrant "Big Tuna".  it was mostly bread. the winner was the onion rings that came with the sub... WOW!! the onion rings were HUGE, very smoothly dipped in beer battery, and fried to a gorgeous and crunchy golden brown . it is straight up exactly the onion rings i used to get from a local Brooklyn pizza joint. it was a large serving too. i love that! no joke , the rings were so big, i could have worn it as a bracelet. they were not soggy at all. whomever is cooking it knew what they were doing. the restaurant is very clean, great atmosphere, nicely furnished, and very welcoming. i would come back for the onion rings.My wife and I visited Iceberg Drive Inn for the first time and I did not love it.  We both ordered milk shakes and Iceberg offers "thick" milkshakes.  I did not realize that "thick" meant ice cream in a cup.  I commented to my wife that, when you serve a milk shake without a straw there is a fundamental problem.

The "regular" milkshake that I ordered was gigantic and I would not have ordered one that large had I known it would not be a drink.  My wife ordered a "mini" and it came out the exact same size as my regular.  We clarified that they had given her a mini and they said that it was.  Her cup was red and mine was blue and her cup was about half-an-inch shorter than mine - but, like I said, her ice cream was as tall as mine so I felt like a chump for paying more.

My chocolate milkshake didn't have much flavor.  I love chocolate milk and when I ordered the shake I was really looking forward to a good chocolaty shake, but it was really just cold with a hint of chocolate.

Iceberg Drive Inn wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't good enough for me to go back to.Went there for lunch during a week day.  The place was pretty empty.  While the restaurant was dressed to the 9's, it didn't give off confident vibes about serving good cuisine.  Restaurant looked more like a night club than a restaurant. Waitress didn't know what I was talking about when I ordered a hefeweizen.  Once I received my beer in a tiny glass, I asked for a lemon wedge (I know people, should be oranges but I was trying not to be too difficult), the waitress looked at me like I asked for a chicken leg to garnish my beer.  She served me the lemon wedge on a soggy napkin.  Not inspiring too much confidence.  I ordered the edamame and chicken wings.  Edamame came in a tiny portion and was way too greasy. Chicken wings was good but not spicy enough.  My friend ordered the sliders and they were the size of quarters.  I heard the mahi mahi was really good and tried to order it but was told they ran out (which I'm not sure how since the restaurant was empty).  But I shall go back once they have their act more together.  Need to go back to check out the cool indoor/outdoor bar.  Hopefully they'll increase their menu items and more people will find out about the place.It seems like every restaurant and bar concept has been tried at this location but nothing has ever stuck for one reason or another.  This building has been several different bars, several different restaurants, and most recently a Dillon's BBQ restaurant.  Will the newest concept stick?  Well, if it does, they'll need to improve on the quality of the food in my opinion.

My brother and I came here by chance while driving north on Central Avenue.  The place bumps right up against the canal midway between Northern and Dunlap.  The namesake is very much geared toward the many bikers and runners who traverse the historic Murphy Bridle Path from Bethany Home road to where the Path ends right here.  They even give discounts to folks to ride their bike here instead of their cars.  Great way to get patrons in the door.

The interior is pretty roomy (bordering on cavernous) with booths against the wall, a bar, and tables in the middle.  The patio in the back is right up against the canal on one side and Central Ave on the other.  There were flat screen TVs at every booth tuned to football so we went with a booth.

None of the main entrees appealed to me at the time so I actually went with the sausage and soft pretzel platter.  I love sausage and I love pretzels, so why not.  It was served with two different Schreiner's sausages, two small pretzel rolls, a cheese dip and potatoes.  The sausages were very good, though I was disappointed with the portion sizes.  The platter is meant to serve two but I easily took the sausages myself as the portion size was relatively small.  The potatoes I got with the platter were also super dry and tasted like they'd been stuck under a heat lamp for awhile.  The cheese dip was pretty good and was a decent compliment to the pretzel rolls, but not necessarily the sausages.

Overall, the place was sort of meh.  The food was acceptable, but didn't wow me.  The vibe of the restaurant didn't excite me, though this place would work very well as a place to watch the NFL on Sundays with all the TVs they have in there.  And I like the concept of catering to the neighborhood bridle path crowd.  But if my dish was any indication of the rest of their menu, they should focus their improvement efforts on the food.Before I placed my order, I asked the girl at the register what Greens and Proteins specialties are and she said make your own plate, and the BBQ chicken pizza. I decided on the pizza. 

My order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a "traditional" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.

Towards the end of my meal, I called over the manager to give him some feedback. While I appreciated him sitting down with me and having an open conversation, I did not like the fact that he said normally I would offer a refund but in this case I don't think we did anything wrong. I wasn't asking for a refund just offering my honest feedback. 

Overall, I like the concept of the restaurant and I am willing to come back to try more items on the menu.Take the East's love of hearty Americanized Italian, merge it with the Midwest's love of even heartier portions of meat and potatoes and you have Detroit's Joe Vicari's.  Get ready to mix it up and eat!

Located in the D in DTLV, it delivers a Strip like experience at off Strip prices.

Straight to it, starters.  The giant meatball is very good.  Huge, flavorful, juicy, topped with a tart ricotta and swimming in a acidic tomato sauce.  The carpaccio (everyday shaved beef topped with arugula, an excess of Parmesan and tangy mustard vinaigrette), OK.  The calamari, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside also just OK.

Next up, salads.  The caprese is as fresh and vibrant as any but it's a non Italian salad that steels the show. The table side Caesar is excellent.  Coddled egg, anchovies, freshly grated Parmesan; a classic.

It's not Italian without pasta. All freshly made in house.  The Pappardelle with veal ragu is excellent.  Flavorful and tasting like hours of low simmering created it.  

The main event, meat.  Standard steakhouse cuts.  Decently trimmed, with a mild 30 day dry aged flavor. A tomahawk and porterhouse were well seared, slightly over temp, tender, with only the lightest bleu cheese, nutty flavor.  OK naked but when paired with Detroit's famed Zip Sauce (a concoction of butter, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, and cayenne), the flavors of the steak explode.

Standard steakhouse sides.  Good, simply grilled asparagus or roasted potatoes.  

OK wine list.  Focus on Italy.  Prices are fair.  Good service but lacking the energy you would expect from an Italian eatery.

A welcome addition to town.A review for parents with tweens and who may be beer drinkers. First of all they don't have beer. Which is fine, it really is, if you are going for your kids. We took our boys 9 & 12 and their friends for the 12 year old's birthday. We didn't hold the party there we just went after a movie, dinner and cake. I think the boys had fun. We bought a card for each boy with maybe five attractions and $3 worth of game that came to about $15 each. The boys could use the bumper cars, laser tag, laser maze, and the jungle gym (they were too old). They liked the laser tag but said Stratum was better. They enjoyed the bumper cars but only chose to do it once. They did the laser maze more than once, they could go in together and it was a challenge. The only problem was the confusion getting in. They use their card to access the attractions if the attendant moved, like went to go flirt with the girls at the counter which he did every chance he got, the kids would walk up and swipe their card and try and get in. The attendant would notice get them out but then they were out an attraction. Our birthday boy did this, we had he card refilled but the girl didn't do enough and it was a hassle. They have high school kids working everything and need more adults or better training. 

They have good games about $1 or more each play and you get tickets to get cheap toys like at Peter Piper etc. 

All in all, it was a good experience and very pretty by the bowling alley, looks exactly like a cool bar without the booze. Lots of tv's, places to sit, bowling lanes and a coffee shop. It's nice but fairly  pricey for an hour of fun for the kids. I want them to succeed just because they are local folks but they need something else to get us there more often.Preface:  my mother is from Louisiana and I spent much time all over the state growing up and later as an adult.  I LOVE and actively seek out Cajun cuisine where ever I go.
I visited this establishment while in the area for business.  I looked up some reviews and decided to give it a try.

I ordered catfish and red beans w rice.  The fish looked great but was very tough and chewy.   Had a good taste but weird texture.
I did not care for the red beans as they were watery and had little spice.
I may come again to try the gumbo but not anytime soon.I was definitely excited to try this place for a girls dinner party. When I arrived, I was greater by (who I assume) was the manager. Very friendly and helped me find my group. Once I sat down, it was nearly impossible to get a drink order in since all had already done so. Finally when we ordered din, I got a drink too. Our table had two waiters, which was confusing. You'd think by having two we'd have prompt service. Not the case. Wrong order, app brought out early when it was asked to be an entree, again took for ever to get my second drink... Oh and my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else's even though we ordered together. We asked twice about it... Then it popped up. They offered to spilt our checks, which was nice (we were prepared to pay cash). And when we got out checks, half were messed up. Then one of the waiters accused two of us for not paying for our drinks... When we explained they were on others tabs and we straightened it out, he never apologized. I realize group outings can be difficult for restaurants but we were a considerably easy table with a lot of blunders. Service, 2 stars (with the exception of the initial greeter/manager?)

I ordered the red sangria which was great! Tastes like grape juice, much sweeter than your average sangria. So may be a no-go for some. And the baja fish tacos with chips. A fresh mango salsa topping the tacos was definitely above par! My food was a solid 4.5 stars. 

I'll return but most likely will hit the bar area.Wife and I dined last night.  Server was horrible.. saved only by the outstanding sushi chefs.  Had they not been as attentive, available, and enthusiastic as they were I would have left 2 stars.

The  food:  

Outlaw Roll: Horrible. tastes like cardboard.

GOOD:

Jalepeno Tail:  AWESOME!!! no rice on this one., fresh fish (forgot what exactly and I don't see it on the online menu), layered over fesh avacado,  pickled jalepeno and more.  SURPRISINGLY good.  I would come back for this and I consider myself a sushi snob.
Hamachi Kama FREAKING AWESOME!!!   Baked Hamachi Collar.  Well seasoned, nice garnish of roe atop. Large portion. FREAKING AWESOME and an great value.  I suggest a side of rice with this one. I'll be back for this one too.


My first visit at Sushi Brokers Scottsdale years ago was less than pleasing.  I would return for the two dishes above for sure. 

Bad:

Service: As mentioned our server two thumbs down. After taking my wifes drink order he disappeared.   Dropped off the glass of wine 10 minutes later and was gone again.  I had to put the order in with the sushi chefs otherwise it would have been another 10 minutes till he reappeared.  I had to wave him down behind the counter to order a beer.  Only showed up again once we were done.   I would've tipped him 5% but I don;t think two wrongs make a right si I left the standard 20%.   I tipped the Sushi Chefs 20$, had they not been so attentive our experience would have been intolerable.  So that's a 50% tip total out of fairness.    Our server spent way too much time behind the counter lollygagging, looking confused with nothing to do. 

We could have spent a lot more..How: .Had he asked about the Jalepeno Tail and listened to our delight he would have had a window to suggest another dish.   Had he come by sooner and noticed my wifes glass of wine empty we would have ordered another one.. seems reasonable considering I had a Huge bottle of Orion in front of me.. I ended up sharing it with my wife at the end.  Common sense serving goes a long way.. not only does it make a better experience but makes more $ for both the servers and the house.  Our bill was 53$ PRIOR to the extra 30$ combined tip.  We could have easily spent twice that had he taken initiative and been somewhat attentive.

One more suggestion: Management:  That mirror in th elongated middle corner behind the Sushi station, it reflects into the area ABOVE the station.  Since exposed tot eh diners it would be a good idea to at least have it functionally organized or fill it up and merchandise it so at least it looks esthetically pleasing.This is another 3.5 star situation for me. But because of a few things, it just feels more like a 3 than a 4. 

My girlfriend and I went here for their happy hour (3-7 daily), and since I love margaritas and very infrequently get them, I was excited about their margarita on happy hour. We got there and we ordered a margarita, a daiquiri, the quesadilla, and the nachos. 

On the happy hour menu, they have a bunch of apps which looked good, but we were sticking to cheap and the nachos and quesadillas were listed as 3.99. 

My margarita was... Bad. It was a house margarita, and weirdly enough I had the exact same experience at a NYC restaurant with their happy hour margarita. It tasted like toilet cleaner. I guess when they pre mix a huge batch for happy hour, it's easy to mess it up. I told the bartender and he switched it out immediately, I don't know if it was because it was good service or because this happens a lot. I barely finished my sentence and he was making me a new fresh one. 

The quesadillas were very very good, and we had agreed to get chicken on it instead of just cheese. I figured ok. At 3.99 we could take the upcharge for chicken right? Well unfortunately he failed to mention that by adding chicken it was no longer the happy hour menu item, so it was $7 dollars. Not a big deal, but was expecting a little bit less. 

The nachos were... Very bland. They had way to much bean on it and it honestly canceled out the cheese taste. It was covered with cheese but you barely tasted it, and nachos without cheesiness are a waste IMO. 

Overall, I liked my second margarita a lot, the daiquiri was pretty good, and the quesadilla was delicious. The manager also checked with us as did the bartender multiple times to make sure things were OK, so clearly they care about service. However, with that bad first margarita and very mediocre nachos, I just can't give this place a four at the moment. Will go back to try again!Kinda scared our first time...Wednesday night at 8pm, only 2 people when we walked in.  Great fish, chips and hush puppies. Onion rings too.  Fries were the bomb,  fresh cut,  great seasoning! We sat at the bar; the bartender was great.  Felt like high school with the 80's music playing.  Reasonable prices. Not sure about the guy/employee/mgr at hostess station wearing gym shorts. I recommend some sort of uniform for the staff...even just matching tshirt...oh and no gym shorts. :-/  However,  we will go back for Friday night fish fry... all you can eat.  Worth a try.Just moved here from Colo Spgs and had been to the Big Fat Greek there many times, it was one of our favorites. We always ordered the Big meat platter. We were disappointed when we came here and the items were different than what we were used to and also the portion size was also smaller. They hook you up In Colo Spgs, CO location, It was good, just not what were used to from our past experiences at MY BIG FAT GREEK. Service was good, restaurant was nice and clean. We may return for items that cant be found at a normal greek cafe, but found another yummy place if you want a juicy delicious gyro sandwich, Phoenicia is delicious!!This is more of a 3.5 for me at this point, but could bump it up in the future. I've been coming here on Tuesday nights which is open mic night. The service is friendly and there are a surprising number of people there for a Tuesday night. Kind of an older crowd. Most of the bands play classic rock, which I can get into. So the open mic night is fun and adds to the atmosphere so that is more of the 4-star-I'm-a-fan category, and I'd like to see what the place is like on the weekend too, so I'll be back. And it's a unique bar and hangout for the neighborhood so it gets points there.

The beer and food is more in the 3-star-A-OK category. I've tried a few different beers and all were pretty good but nothing to write home about. Their beers can't compete with the other more established local breweries like Four Peaks or San Tan, at least not yet. North Mountain seems to rotate out their beers so I could see them eventually brewing up a beer that become their signature just like Kiltlifter is for Four Peaks. 

I only got food this last time I was there. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. As my friends even pointed out, the chicken breast on my sandwich was quite small. The chipotle mayo didn't have much of a kick, and I could have done without the bacon jam. I had overlooked the jam when I ordered the sandwich so next time I'll know to ask them to hold that, but I don't really get that condiment when you already have chipotle mayo. And if you want bacon, then you can just order actual bacon and not bacon in jam form, amirght? All that aside it really wasn't a bad grilled chix, and I will add that my friend liked her french onion soup very much.Great food..... Ridiculous prices.....i cant in my right mind fork over 30.00 for 2 adults to eat at a fast food joint.
Sorry 5 guys..... I'm out and eating elsewhere ..Overhyped in my opinion. I understand this part of the strip has been pretty dead and they've been trying to bring some life back into this part of town but they could have spent a bit more time looking at other clubs and seeing how they could have one upped them. 

Went pre-opening weekend to see Hardwell and it was awesome. Lights and sound were awesome along with the endless amount of confetti. That air thingy though sucks. I mean I can barely feel it.

Went a bit early to get in and that took forever. I mean it was SLOW and after I went in, it was still empty. Stairs weren't was bad as Marquee but dark enough for a drunk person to eat it. Dance floors are a bit bigger which is nice. Did I mention there's a large abundance of restrooms?

I'll be back depending on DJ and because of my friends but this place lacked a lot of things such as an open area to sit down. I mean other clubs offer crappy seating but at least that's something instead of nothing. Tables aren't really going to cut it especially when you can't even sell out all the tables. Oh did I mention drinks are bit pricier here?This place was pretty standard for a night club, I thought. There were some impressive pros and some major NOs. 

First $110 for male entry - wtf? Who would pay that? Thank god we were on the list because there's no way I would ever dish up that kinda cash. 

We went into the lounge part of the club, which was nice and not overly loud. We could hear our group talking and we had a nice time. The bartenders (at the bar) in this  section were SUPER professional. He realized that we were a large group and introduced himself by name. Unlike other Vegas nightclub bartenders, he actually seemed to care that we were there spending $20/drink. Nice touch. 

My friend and I took a tour of the rest of the  club and it was impressive in a lose-yourself-in-a-sea-of-flesh/noise/smoke sorta way. Each level had a different feel and vibe... Pretty cool.We went in for a light dinner and drinks. So ok, the food was ok. Nothing to write home about but i enjoyed my meal. Price of the burger was fair. 

Drinks.....Ummm $7 for a beer. RIDICULOUS. I will never be back just on the principle. Any owner that thinks it is ok to charge $7 for a beer doesn't deserve my business. Good bye.This Monta is slightly bigger than the one on Spring Mountain, and seems to have a bit more items on their menu (They have pork bao! I might try that next time). However, the taste/flavor of their ramen doesn't meet my expectations after being a regular at Monta Spring Mountain. 

Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but not great. I would've given this place 4 stars... but, during my quest to devour all the ramen, i bit into something hard. Upon further inspection, it seemed to be a wood chip? It was dark brown in color, so it couldn't have come from my chopsticks (your typical wooden tan disposable chopsticks). My best guess is it was from a wooden ladle when they were dishing out the broth? I guess I shall never know. It was towards the end of my meal, so I just left it as is.Overall food was tasty.  Fish and chips were fried nicely.  Two portions of fish were tasty if a bit small.  Mahi over rice again was tasty and nciely grilled.  Over all prices are a little high for lunch.  It was basically $24 for 2 for lunch.  

Were it's a little strange is the setup.  You walk up to the front counter order your food and pay at the register.  Then you sit down and they bring you the food, but it's not a waiter/waitress setup.  So it's a little confusing if you tip or not.  They say it's not necessary but you almost feel like you should tip because of the way they have it setup, but if you've already paid for the food by credit card, and have no cash, then what?

Over all, food was tasty, but a little pricey and there's the situation above.  Will come back again, but probably not as often.For them jus opening up I expect for them to be busy. I didn't have to wait to long. But the thing that disappointed me was that cut back on the plate size. I figured that they probably was doing that cause maybe they had limited supply and  wanted to make sure they were able to feed everybody. I don't know, but that kinda disappointed me. Cause I been 2 several locations and this is the first. Overall the food was still great, but i just hope they go back to their regular portion sizes. Like getting a bowl of Gnocci soup with no chicken or dumplings lol Really!"You eat your Gyros at a gas station?"

Yes I do, but only because of the outdoor seating.The Place is a nice place. Joe and I visited here last Saturday afternoon for a quick drink. I had a glass of prosecco and he had a JD and diet coke, both were nice and fairly reasonably priced.

Reasons why I like it include: table service, lots of nice and comfy seats, fairly decent cocktail menu (if a little pricey).

However, it is lacking a bit of atmosphere and the food menu doesn't contain anything special that makes me want to go back and eat there.

It is a pleasant location for a drink.Parking is horrendous. Here they are sitting on countless acres of empty desert scrub land and some genius has devised a parking lot so needlessly complex it is a maze of one-way streets.  Ridiculous considering there is nothing but the casino for miles in any direction.  WTF?Wing's up is a very solid option for Wings in Waterloo, they have a number of different flavours to choose from and different options for how they prepare the wings. They do have other menu options but lets me honest, who goes to a place called Wings Up and orders a wrap?  The fries however are very good; crispy potato wedges seasoned to perfection.  My only complaint are the take-out containers,  they use a very cheap cardboard container with printed graphics on the outside.  It is kind of like wrapping your chicken wings in a freshly printed magazine, the wings heat up the cardboard and soak into it leaving you with a cancerous smelling, soggy box when you get home.   I'd recommend pouring the contents of the take-out box onto a plate as soon as possible.  Another concern is the price, a pound of wings and fries runs about $15.  Which at a nice sit-down restaurant makes sense, but at a take-out place It is hard to justify. Other than that, great wings.At the end of the day I think I would have liked this place better if I would have stopped in for HH...or brunch...or a weeknight...or w/just a few friends. Basically, I just think coming here w/14 other girls on a Saturday night for a bachelorette party, although super fun, is also kind of a chore. 

I really do like the place itself. It's a really big area, and I like that the bar wraps around like a square and that there's plenty of bartenders. If dancing's your thing the dance floor seems pretty big as well.

Like I said, we came for a bachelorette party, and although I didn't personally take care of any of the details, there were a couple small snafus. First, when we called to book a table (this I was actually present for) we were told that we didn't "have" to get bottle service, but would probably have to pay some sort of minimum on drinks. They would contact my friend who personally spoke to someone "soon" to go over the details. It took somebody a couple weeks to get back to her, but when they did they did inform her we would in fact have to get the "minimum" bottle service. Honestly, it really wasn't that big a deal. Like I said, there was 14 of us, and the minimum bottle service was $200 (we got Grey Goose), plus they would throw in a round of shots. 

We got the table for 10 o'clock. However, when we showed up we were told we didn't have it until 10:45. Again, I didn't personally take care of this detail, but they did scramble to get us a table ASAP (it took about 20 min). 

Overall, we had no major issues, and I thought this place was fun. When we left the line to get in was around the corner, and if I were to just randomly come here on a Saturday night I don't think waiting in a long line to get in would be worth it. 

I'd like to come back sometime to try the taps at the tables.This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.Great selection but their fees make the guns WAY overpriced.  They charge 12% on top of the price you win the bid for then you pay taxes on everything.  I am not sure why people keep bidding on these guns when you can sometimes buy them new for less.  The place here is huge and if you do not come to inspect a day early you can miss your chance to bid since the line to pay the $200 deposit to bid is long....then you have to collect your $200 at the end if you don't buy and I am sure that line is long also. They sell almost everything here and you can bid online also if you don't mind paying 20% fee on top of your bid price....you getting the picture yet?  I think Sierra does a great job with what they are dealing with but I would save the trip.I had heard and read about how great this place was. Reality didn't match the hype. I had the calamari. It was okay and for $9, I expected a larger portion. The cod tacos were okay as well. A little too much breading. I will say the clam chowder was very good. My son had the fish and chips. He really liked it. Overall experience was okay; food was average and service was good. Id go back and try it again, but it is a bit over hyped.Much lower than the competition.   Friendly customer service.

We had the sweet chili chicken wrap for $3.99 (without the meal) and 2 apple pies which were on sale for $1.

This is the best option at this food court.  Everything else is so overpriced.Service is too slow!!! It seems that the manager it's the only one working. 
Food and drinks are good.Like Mike said affordable bbq. I got two generously piled sandwiches on toasted hamburger buns and a side for $5.50. This is designed to feed the masses not a bbq lovers dream. 
It wasn't bad and I would go in again but I did not fall in Luv with Luv me Tender. I ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork. Two classic bbq sandwiches so I was more than happy with the price. The problem is the meat though good quality(not excessively fatty or greasy) didnt have a lot of flavor. The bbq sauce on the table tasted like grocery store generic brand product. Mike M. below said more sauces existed but I was in a rush assumed it was a house sauce and it would be pretty good. It took a goof 10-15 minutes for my food. No one else was inside and you ordered at a sliding window similar to Filbertos. So if you live in a dale or  farEast Valley dont drive here for it but if you are nearby give it a chance.  

The potatoes was also a decent sized portion and no complaints. Not exactly bbq style...it was more au gratin vibe with garlic. 

oh yeah they are closed sunday and tuesday. open till about 7 most nights. no fountain drinks visible but possibly behind the sliding window. owned by same people as long wongs. in the same parking lot. much smaller than long wongs. Possibly swamp cooler type cooling. not traditional a/c Tables could seat15-20 at most.BEER is great here. Tons of selection so you never get bored. The service is great on some nights but on some nights it sucks. Unless you sit at the bar. Food is actually pretty good for being a bar. Also, Alicia worst server NA.The Harrahs is not bad, but there are much better hotels on the strip for much better rates. The Casino is relatively old and needs partly some renovation. 
The machines pay good, I hab some luck. There's a pool on the roof of the second level.They say to try everything once right?  Finally made it over to Sweets Raku with a few of my buddies to check out what the "red carpet" out front was all about.  First off, I like the decor of the place.  You are immediately greeted by a wall of wine, which looks fantastic peering in from the outside, and a few pieces of novel art work on the wall (and in the bathroom.. very neat) that sets the tone of the evening: relaxed and inviting.  It was a little warm for my taste but they were baking stuff right in front of you so I quickly disregarded.

Now, the food.  I like the concept of the menu in that once you order off of it, you can eat it.  They even provide some dipping sauce (raspberry on this occasion, I believe) for you to dip and munch.  Pretty cool in my book.  Opted for a cheese place because we came from an edomae place before we hit up sweets and I wasn't ready to grub anything too big.  Also divulged in a few glasses Sav Blanc to keep the party going and for pairing purposes as well.  Not too shabby and the cheese plate was a pretty good way to keep me at bay over casual conversation.  The part I liked most about the cheese plate actually wasn't the cheese.. it was the spiced pastry sticks that came with it.  I would've just snacked on that for the evening if I could order just that!  Easily the highlight of the culinary venture here.  I also tasted some pistachio ice cream, mango and yuzu marshmallows, and a little bit of the Red Rock cake to get in on a few of the flavors that they had to offer.  Everything was alright but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  I definitely liked the fact that it wasn't super sweet as I am not really a fan of overly sweet desserts, but, again, it was an ok experience with nothing that really stood out.

Service was good and I liked the fact that I can see the staff divvy up some dishes right in front of me.  I think the prices are reasonable and probably worth the experience but with everything factored in, I just wasn't feeling it.  Note: I'm a bit more partial to the other "face" of Raku around the corner but just couldn't hang with this place.  Probably would bring my wife to try it out and see if she would like it but it's just not enough to coax me back for any other outings.Think of it as a Taco Bell that serves beer. Had the cheese enchiladas, not bad at all. Rice was meh, beans okay. Service at the counter was friendly. Atmosphere much cooler than the Bell.i tried three times at this restaurant, the short ribs noodle soup is pretty good.  but today, i tried again, the soup base changed, noodle feels not the same as i previous had, and the short ribs..is tough.  hope it could keep up with the quality of the food...it is unique in town..More like A-NOT ok! I 'm sorry to see another business has closed in this area and another persons dream crushed. The owner was so excited and proud of her product and new venture when she first took my order. I was impressed that this young lady was able to start a business in this tough economy. It was evident she poured her heart and soul into it.

When I did my initial review, it wasnt a glowing one. I came in the second time around,  the owner obviously knew who I was and she couldn't look me in the eye, she clearly was hurt. I kinda felt bad cause there were a lot of negative reviews. But the review I did was constructive criticism for the most part. Cant speak for the others. 

She did listen to her customers, I was pleasantly surprised with all the changes she made. I was happy to update my review to reflect the improvements.  But I guess you cant please everybody. I noticed a sign last week that advertised they sold tacos and made a mental note to swing by and give it a try. When I drove up  the lights were out and the place is closed for good. How sad. Now all I can picture was that hurt look she had. I never would wish that on anyone. My best wishes and good luck on your future ventures Angelica and your sweet abuela too.it's just ok ,  wait so longCame out for a intimate gathering of friends night out and decided to come to this new spot for drinks and bar food. 

I split chicarron bulaklak and sisig with a few people. The chicarron was decent, but I prefer smaller cuts so you get better crisp to the fatty center ratio. The sisig is fairly decent. I think maybe we should have ordered a bit differently only because it was greasy pork bits overload, specially since I was just at a taco crawl event earlier. 

They had live entertainment, a band and a DJ during their intermissions. There is a stage if you want to dance. My biggest complaint was the volume. We left after a bit because we could not hold any conversation. I tried and ended up a bit hoarse and gave up. There is a happy medium as I've been to bar hangouts where a seat in the back meant you can have both. Most of the people really into it anyways will be dancing, right in front of the band so you don't need it to blare. 

Just a note that they offer happy hour specials daily of 50% off appetizers and $5 drink specials (7-10pm) but do not while there is live entertainment. You may want to call and ask if you're coming there for happy hour on a weekend. 

It's not a bad Filipino bar though. It's typical vibe of the bar-staurants in Philippines.Nice hotel and very clean interior. Staff were polite and professional.

Main problem was that the walls were paper thin, you could easily hear conversation in the next room easily!!!

Otherwise, a solid choice.I wish Yelp didn't have a rating system.  Heritage Tavern is an excellent establishment, but for me personally it was just okay.  Maybe I just wasn't feeling the atmosphere.  

I went there as a four top and despite having made reservations, there was some wait for our table.  Their bar was super crowded, which made standing around holding onto our coats and not bumping into people super awkward.  I found the bartenders incredibly attentive though.  Despite the crowded bar, one of the bartenders saw us enter the bar area and immediately made eye contact and asked if we wanted drink menus, despite us not being right up at the bar.  

Their drinks were yummy and well made.  

Unfortunately, the dining area was also small and crowded and it took some work to get seated and around the waiters.  It was also too loud for me as I had trouble hearing my fellow diners across the table.  

We had the deviled eggs, charcuterie, pork belly with tuna sashimi, grilled octopus salad, ribeye, and whitefish.  We shared everything so we were able to sample lots of different things.  We enjoyed the creativity with the deviled eggs, but we found the eggs themselves rubbery.  The charcuterie was good but I prefer Osteria Papavero's charcuterie plate.  My fellow diners loved the wagyu ribeye best, but I personally perferred the sweet and saltiness of the pork belly.  I found the tuna sashimi with the pork belly unnecessary though and would've preferred they made the pork belly a larger portion and made it into an entree dish. 

In summary, it was evident there was care and attention to each dish, but there just wasn't anything in particular that made a strong impression on me.We came here for dinner about 6pm. The place was pretty easy to find. It's in the hood so becareful. When we arrived, we were the only costumer. The place was very warm and cozy. They had a karaoke system so I'm guessing they get down on certain nights. Plus the place was clean.  I went ahead and order the tonkatsu shoryu ramen bowl. It came with corn, bamboo shoots, pork, eggs and green onions. The food came out at a decent time. The soup was good. But the ramen noodles remind me of top ramen. Like a side we were the only costumer inside and out waiter didn't come by once to see how were doing. We had to wave her down when we were finished. Hmm not sure if I'll be back. But I like to give a second try.Have tried this place twice, probably won't return until they work out the kinks. The menu in the wall is big so you can't miss it. The problem is that it's only a part of what they offer. Their REAL menu is on the counter by the cash register and if you're lucky you'll notice it on your own because they don't draw your attention to it. There was only one counter menu and when I asked for another I was given an 'old' menu with different prices and food choices. What?

It took way too long to get our food and it wasn't hot when it finally arrived. The owners  seem not interested to correct these easily correctable situations.I came here for two reasons: 1. As a great addition to the coffee tour of Phoenix! and 2. because I had time to kill in scottsdale. I really didn't think it was anything special (sorry guys!). I know they roast their own coffee, which is nice, but the coffee was very ordinary. It was fine, but nothing spectacular. Additionally, they have only one size of coffee in mugs (I wanted 16 oz, but could only get 12 unless I wanted a to-go cup... odd). The atmosphere was fine and the owner (possibly?) said they have karaoke, which is kind of neat. Seating inside is a little limited, but I easily got a spot at the window bar. If I were in the neighborhood, I would consider going back, but I think Press is a better choice for the area, and several downtown coffee bars would beat it hands down. Anyway, it was ok, but I won't be rushing back.This place is mediocre but Downtown, it's the perfect little spot to grab a treat and people watch! The set up is your normal fro-yo type of place. Lots of flavors, that you can sample. The toppings bar is generous. The night I went in, there was one girl basically just sitting there reading a magazine, but it's not like you really need a lot of service. They are open until 11 pm which is great if you are Downtown for late dinner or movie! Cute new place, I hope it stays for a while.Just ok. Ambiance..3. Prices...3. Burger...3. Fries...4. Service...4. Parking...5. Coleslaw...4.
Cocktails...2.
No kobe or Angus burger available. 
First time at this restaurant just ok not much to rave about or complain about. Will be about 5th on our list of good burger places. May visit again but prob. not anytime soon.This place is ok, not great, and I'm afraid does not set itself apart from the other great burger places in the Valley. First off, the good: almost everything we ordered was tasty, from the calamari to the burgers to the milkshakes. Good selection of wine and draft beer. Overall we thought the food and drink was about what we expected at this price point. Now, the not so good: it feels like this place opened a few weeks before it was ready. Hosts and service were harried, disorganized, a little confused about the menu, and though they appeared to be trying their best they left something to be desired. The kitchen doesn't seem to get the menu yet, as more often than not the food that came did not match the description. 

And finally, the biggest issue: the space. Other reviewers called the atmosphere nice, or trendy, or classy. We do not get that at all. The space is a very cheap makeover from the previous tenant McCormick & Schmicks. It kind of feels like it was thrown together with little regard for how the room flows or atmosphere. There's no music or what is being played is too low for the cavernous space and loud diners. Frankly, it seems like a fake restaurant built for a commercial where they "surprise" diners with a menu item being switched with something downmarket (e.g. "see what diners said when we switched notorious burgers for Carl's Jr's Six Dollar Burger"). Throw in a mafia "theme" that has you ordering food using infamous mobsters' names and it just seems cheesy for a place where you're looking at $25-30 per person for an a la carte meal with a drink.

Overall, while there were some service/kitchen problems and the atmosphere was non-existent, the food was good enough thst we'd give the place another shot in a couple months and see if the kinks have been worked out.

UPDATE: after posting this review I received a message from the owner asking about my complaints about the atmosphere and and asking if I was in his shoes, what changes would address the issues I raised. I told him what I thought, and who knows if the suggestions will go anywhere. But I do have to respect a business that listens to feedback, good or bad. I'm definitely going back and I hope when I do, I can add a star or two.I am writing only because I do like the atmposphere and any patio in AZ is beautiful.  The problem with the patio setting and being at a brewery, is the want to drink!  The beers are about $7.00 each so you can imagine the bill after a few drinks.  When drinking great beer, you naturally want great food.  The food was not worth the prices at all!  I got a chicken ceasar salad ($10) and the chicken was cubed and cold (yuk!) and the dressing was not ceasar, it was cilantrol something, and there was no parmesan shavings as described, and no croutons!  How is that a ceasar?!  Also, the burger as described was cooked medium-well and was described as being 80% chuck, 20% pork shoulder.  It tasted frozen, looked frozen, and might as well had been frozen because it was cold when I got it!  

My bill of 4 guests was over $100.00 I will not be going back!  It wasn't worth it after the overpriced atmosphere.Pro- service was good. Athena omelet was very good. Seasoned potatoes were ok. A little too salty for me.
Con- Decor is cold. Not hip diner vibe they may have been trying for. The AC was not working too well that day.As someone that lived in the NYC area for many years my "bar" for good pizza is very high!  

I found the pizza to be good.  The slices are very large and the sausage was good Italian sausage. 

I actually enjoyed their buffalo wings the most .  Slightly crispy and not drowned in too much sauce.   You have a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing which isn't always the case in AZ.Decided to give this place a try and I honestly left without the most important thing.. a full stomach. This was my first time going here and I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish which were 10.99/pound. I ordered two of the Hot N Juicy flavors and 1 pound of Louisiana. The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get "full" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn.Only ramen place in the University of Waterloo. their ramen is a bit expensive but their takoyaki was definitely overpriced. I had the shoyu ramen and I enjoyed the taste. I liked their takoyaki but I personally dont think it was worth the price.

I didnt like going in the winter time because some tables were right beside the door and a lot of cold air would go through.Great concept, and pretty good seafood. 
We tried the Clams, Shrimp, and crawfish - added in some sausage as well.
We got 2 different seasonings and both were very good
Shrimp were LARGE and definitely worth the money.
Clams / razor clams were also VERY good.
Crawfish, were borderline Med Rare, the tails were cooked but the tiny claws were a little underdone.. 

Next trip will be Shim n Clams only, and maybe try a Po'boy... 

This place is WORTH the $$  
You figure, 11 bucks for Shrimp,, Go to the local grocery store or LeeLee and you are paying 11.99 a pound, RAW.... and again, Its Seafood... Will definitely be backMy friends and I have had a chance to eat through the entire menu. If 3.5 stars were available, I'd surely award that many to Bootleggers. 

Bootleggers would have done a heckuva lot better had they NOT included some rather large chunks of fat in their pulled pork servings. On the other hand, their brisket presents well, nice smoke ring and good bark on the outside. I'm still confused by the warm tortillas served with the pulled pork. That said, both these meats are somewhat bland with no sauce offered to flavor things up 

The Bacon Board is a nice hook and a pleasant appetizer. But, the REAL reason to eat at Bootleggers is their St Louis-style ribs. Succulent, moist and meat-falling-off-the-bone good, these ribs present well with a discernible smoke ring and real nice rub. They compete favorable with Bobby-Q and Pork On A Fork. The Apple Pie Moonshine deserves an honorable mention.

The service for our visits was excellent and the prices were reasonable.Really slow service, despite lots of servers standing around. Burgers were ok, but better at the Public HouseHad lunch today while a car show was going on. Ordered soup and sandwich. Soup of the day was chili, which was very good. The grilled cheese (which was supposed to be on Texas Toast) was not. Came out plain, a small half sandwich with blah cheese. No presentation. The topper was they charged us 4.25 for a bottle of Bud. No  bar in Ftn. hills charges that much. Might give them one more try-but will hesitate to have a drink.Let's begin with addressing that Panda is NOT a Cirque show. Imagine going to Circus Circus and watching one those every 15-to-the-hour shows they have upstairs in the arcade area, however, much more advanced and 90 minutes of it. 

Yes-the Panda costumes were not the best but every other costume in this show was great. The decor, sound effects, and lighting was phenomenal. The theatre was small, comfy and nice. The performs kept the crowd entertained and some of the stunts have you at the edge of your seat. 

With the exception of a couple scenes, this show was fun and exciting. Great show for kids! Perhaps this act would do better at a different casino, not Palazzo. Maybe Luxor, Excalibur or Circus Circus would be a better home for them?...

Anyone debating on going, should go. People have high expectations of this because of where it's located and have tainted the show but it's actually a cool/ cute act. See it before it's gone!Maybe I had my hopes too high going into this place due to the glowing reviews, but this place was just ok to me. We got there right at 11 when they open and there was a hefty line. Why is the line so long and moves so slowly? The owner individually cuts meat for each person...this is nice and all... but maybe during the summer he may want to consider streamlining the process? Just a thought. And yes, the owner's dad was charming and took us on the tour of the smoker... which we enjoyed, but caused a little stress as our spots in line inched towards the door... we had been waiting in the heat for a long time and didn't want to lose our spot. Anyway, we made it back to our spots as we entered the door. Great. We sampled the brisket.. it was very tasty and tender. Get up to the counter... Our plan was that we would get a 2 meat plate and a sandwich to share with our two meats being the brisket and the (special) beef short rib. Ordered and was informed that the beef short rib didn't come on the plates.... umm, maybe you should disclose this prior? Maybe I missed it, I dunno. The owner said 'Look how big this is, it can't go on the plate!' I guess, but most of its bulk was the bone... the actual amount of meat was not that large. Regardless, we ended up getting the two meat plate with pork rib and brisket (sides: grits and beans), the pulled pork Jefe sandwich (pulled pork, sausage, pickles... we got it without slaw), and a beef short rib (that's why we came, right?). The total? 40$! Whoa... that's some expensive BBQ. Some of the food was very good and others did not live up to expectation. The short rib was good, but had a bit of a burnt flavor. The pork ribs were pretty boring... no sauce... the sauce they have on the table was not very flavorful and the meat didn't fall off the bone... kind of a meh dish. The brisket was good, as previously stated, very tender, but a bit peppery. The grits were gluey and not spicy enough for being billed as 'jalapeno' and the beans were nothing special either. The sandwich was the stand out dish. The pulled pork was very good, I didn't love the sausage, but the pork and the pickles with some sauce made for a tasty sandwich. I don't know that I would be back anytime soon, but if I did, I would get the pork sandwich and be done. 

PS I ate so much meat at this place, I'm pretty sure I got the meat sweats, so be careful! Haha. 

Happy eating Yelpers!

PPS - I got this response from the owner here, which I think is really awesome. Nice to know some owners can look at their business and make small changes to improve! Thanks Scott!

'Thanks for coming in to check out our little barbecue place and for posting a Yelp review. I'll be honest, three stars isn't what I like to see but after reading your review I get it and we are going to change a few things. This week we are going to make sure that it's easy to see on the menu that the beef rib isn't included with the plate. I wish we could add them to the plates but my cost on each one is around $12. I'm also going to tweak my cooking method tonight to hopefully not have them get that burnt taste. For some reason, they took forever to cook and I think it dried out the meat a little and gave them too much smoke.  Right now we have tons of people ordering very large orders right when we open and the line stands still while that happens. We are adding another smoker in the next two months and will advertise that we take bulk meat to go orders for pick up prior to open. Our hope is that it will alleviate the wait when we are putting together those orders. I'm sorry about the grits, every now and then they get a little dry and become gummy. We now have a little cup of water nearby to make sure that that doesn't happen.  

Once again, thanks for coming in and thanks for your input. It has been beneficial.'We walk past here almost everyday on the way to play poker and it seems strange that it would only be open until 3pm considering the amount of people currently at this location. Finally we got to try it on a day off! 

The portion sizes are huge, I guess for the price of the meals they should be. I ordered the Andy's special which was melted cheese with scrambled egg, fried chicken, bacon spinach, tomato, biscuit on griddled potato mash thing and chipotle cream on the side. Oh and a wedge of watermelon and a strawberry. When It arrived at the table I thought they had brought the wrong thing over it was that huge. I attempted to dismantle it so I could start eating it but it was piled up so high the fried chicken fell off the top and knocked my full large glass of orange juice over onto my meal. I think the orange juice actually helped the potato thing because that was pretty dry. I still managed to get through most of it (except the biscuit and potato..trying to watch my waistline hahaha). It was all just ok. Not overly tasty not overly anything.. Just big and edible... 

The service was good as well. The lady replaced my OJ. 

Everyone else's meals were pretty much the same.. Nothing wrong with it just nothing fabulous.. Yet to find a decent breakfast place in Vegas!!! 
Would I come back here? Only if I was desperate..I first heard of this place on the news.  As a retro gamer myself, I had to check it out.

The place is a Super Mario Bros. theme'd restaurant.  They have TVs mainly for Super Mario Bros games but I did see some Sega Genesis consoles that had NBA JAM playing.  Me and my nephew stuck around to play Smash Bros on the Wii.  

The staff was cool and friendly.  They helped us out in deciding what we would like to have.  We ended up getting their special of Pizza and Wings.

The restaurant screams nostalgia.  They have tons of choices of what to play while you wait for your food.

When the food came in.... 

The wings were ok.  We ordered the BBQ sauce on top and it tasted normal, just like any hole in the wall restaurant with a deep fryer and the ability to put sauce on their food.  The wings were crisp and cooked but nothing special.

The pizza however wasn't up to par to what I expected.  The dough was still white and the ingredients did taste like it came straight out of a grocery store brand can.  It's not terrible food however in a place like this, I expected a different recipe or exclusive taste.  Without the concept of video games and geek culture surrounding the tables, its just another pizza spot.

The place is still a new establishment so I can't be too harsh with a review.  They are still cool people and have lots of room for improvement.  Can't wait to see what lies ahead in the future of this business.Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!! 
I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)We stopped here because the kids really wanted pizza before going on the high roller. The food itself was good, I just think it was overpriced for what it was. Being locals I could not honestly see ourselves making an effort to come back but to be honest we are probably not the crowd they are after.Went there on opening day but too busy and too long of a line and we left.

Today my husband bought me some chocolate mousse, brownie and crumble bun. 

Chocolate mousse was divine but @ $10/pc, it was a little hefty,

Brownie was moist and super cholatey- $5 
Crumble is about $4

Overall, great tasting pastries but a little too high on the price which is expected specially from Carlos bakery. It was all divine, would definitely indulge once in a while! 

Cute place and a must see bakery, lots of different pastries to choose from!I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile. So went here with a few friends. I ordered the sashimi tacos. Its basically 4 mini tacos from the appetizers. They were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. I thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. The sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. They broke apart pretty easily. Also tried the chicken wraps. Its only enough for 3 people. They give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. Its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. My friends had a regular burger and and a turkey burger. Both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. It had good sized portions.

For a drink, I got the Java Guava. Really good. It had a little spice to it. It came with a jalapeno on the side. Dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. Nothing too special. It was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. Also a good portion. Its enough for 3-4 people.

Overall, its an ok place. The location of the restaurant is facing the street. It also has outdoor seating. So people watching can be interesting.Just average to okay food.  I would agree with a previous reviewer who said the place is noisy due its construction and layout.  The fries were not that great and mostly small and stubby.  I'm neither impressed nor do I care about the whole "local" foods aspect about this place.  I want a good burger and just because the beef is local doesn't mean its the best.  

Oh and one last suggestion:  they had four television sets, three of which had a soccer game and one which had the Brewers game. If you want to keep it local, put the Brewers baseball game on most of the TVs and leave the soccer for the late night ESPN 3 crowd.Ordered food to go...crab puffs (or whatever they call them...in any event when I got home I ended up with egg rolls...or whatever they call them).  Also ordered pad thai and yellow curry.

Egg rolls were ok.  Although I would have liked to have got what I ordered (crab puffs).

Pad thai was good.  Not overly sweet like others I've had.  The curry was also good.  I asked for both dishes mild.  Unlike most thai places I've been to, mild actually means mild.  There was a time I could eat spicy food, but that time has passed, so actually getting mild when you order mild is a good thing.I have been to Squeeze once, and my initial impression is that it's something that will work well in the Linq strip of shops and eateries. You can get fresh squeezed juices and smoothies made from fresh fruits and vegetables while you wait.. and to many of them you can add a little bit of booze if you like. ...from my perspective, it's just a little bit of booze. 

I really like the concept of this place, though.. and they also offer gluten free products including baked items and sandwiches. That's a nice feature that people think they want these days. All sandwiches and salads and whatnot that I noticed were $8+ before tax. All 4 drinks we ordered were $14 each . that's allot for cocktails and juices, even on the strip. 

That included a small green smoothie I ordered called  "the cleanse," to which I had Hendricks Cucumber Gin added.. it was good... But pricey for what it was. Green tasting, lots of un-pureed bits.. which I actually didn't mind at first, but then chewing my drink became interfering of actually drinking the smoothie. Tons of ice too.. so it was a little watered  down tasting. 

I actually give it 3.5 stars, because the concept is good and I think it'll do descent business, being located where it is. However, $14 is waaaay too much for a smoothie that's 12-16 oz. .. and honestly I think the recipes need some tweaking. 

I'll be back to check it out again soon, I'm sure! Happy Eating to you !WEnt to get takeout.
They forgot to put my meal in the bag.
When I discovered this later, they offered to replace and refund, so kudos for that, but
the cake was flavorless.
PROS:
samosas had a good flavor, seemed to be possible homemade.
Meal had good flavor too, 

will give them another chanceAte breakfast here today; overall a really good atmosphere and some tasty items on the menu.  I would recommend their Wiggies, a hodgepodge of hash browns, cheese, green peppers, diced ham, and mushrooms. I topped it off with a mimosa and
then my gf and I strolled out onto their dock and enjoyed some lakeside scene.It's a strip mall near a bunch of hotels off the beltline.  They have a few cool stores like Ann Taylor Loft, Michaels, and a huge scrapbook store.  Other than that, its nothing special and you're probably better off going to another mall in the area for a more extensive selection.It doesn't match the layout of the other Barriques and the seating area is a little cramped and sparse.  Still serves the great coffee that I have come to know and love but unlike their other cafe's, the staff is a little surly and indifferent at times.I'm soo confused.

Am I in a post office, sit down restaurant, or casual coffee shop? If you were going for the blend of all three, then heck, I guess you nailed it.
Seriously. There are postal boxes in this joint.

The best things I can say about this was that the coffee was hot. The breakfast burrito I had was "meh". Nothing great, nothing terrible. It was warm but took fooooooooorrrr-eeeeeeev-errrrrrrrrrr.  It was just okay. They don't accept plastic. I can understand your local dive bar or small coffee shop not wanting to accept plastic, but for what (I think) they are trying to do here, I would expect them to accept cards. But they don't. If you think about it, it almost seems like they are going back to the good ol' days of the general store. Middleton's one-stop shop.  You can check your postal box, get your coffee, get your paper, and buy random goods. Besides a hitching post for your horse, what more could you need?

Take it. Leave it. Whatever.My husband and I went out here on our date night. Walking through the door we instantly thought Noodles and Co. due to the menu layout on the wall. It being our first time here we made it through the typical awkward stage of processing the scene to figure out how to order and the drink situation.(they have a soda fountain that is hard to see to the left)   My husband was very satisfied with the place but I'm still a little reserved. I got the stirfry which was okay. I think the crunchy vegetables were the best. The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking. As usual my husband shared with me a piece of his sesame chicken and I instantly got jealous. I wanted his plate. LOL For two people w drinks two appetizers (2 spring rolls, 3 cream cheese puffs) plus each upgrading to 10 ingredient fried rice $1.75 it to $27 and change. We had a living social coupon for $20 my husband still wants to come back but if I do I'm ordering off the classic menu as he did. Live and learn I guess. :) A plus, they have an outside patio.We come here a lot and the food is never consistent. Sometimes it's really salty. Other times it's too spicy or not spicy enough. There must be several different cooks because the sauce is never the same either. We still like the adventure of what we may get today. Stop for quick bite on the way home. If you tried it and didn't like it you may want to try again, you may be surprised at how much better or different the next time may be. 

The servers here are friendly enough but some times they difficult to read. Place is not always clean but it's clean enough. I don't like the fact that some of the tables are falling apart but there is always customers here so they must be doing something right.This Nitty Gritty I would have to say is not as good as the downtown madison one and the sole reason is that it is way too small for how many people generally go there. Also their dartboard and such is not well placed and becomes a nuisance when trying to return to the bar for another drink. They have good drink specials and its still got that classic nitty atmosphere but not great...I would rate vin santo at 2.5 stars for food and 4 stars for service. I guess I'm used to great Italian fare in San francisco, but the food at Vin Santo didnt quite cut it for me both times I've eaten here. The portions are large, but taste doesnt cut it for me.After looking around Madison for a good and authentic Italian place, Vin Santo has the potential.  The pasta is definitely fresh, and the tiramisu was very good.  Downsides - I felt that the dishes could have used more finesse in the seasoning and flavor and less in the overall amount, they were tasty but did not just pop out at me.  For instance, the ravioli was great - good pasta and sauce, but the spinach stuffing was just bland.  Nevertheless, I will go back - need to find out if some of those spicier dishes are truly spicy.I've walked past the Soup Factory numerous times on my way into Barriques. I decided to finally stop in yesterday.

Now, as you can guess, this place's focus is....SOUP. They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold). I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich. I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup. 

The stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat! The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing. It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!

I'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!Solid spot for diner breakfast fare in Middleton-- popular with the grandma and grandpa set.  Like all good diners, service is friendly, they keep the coffee cup full, and know how to crank through tables.  They've always been busy when we've been there (weekend mornings) but even when the wait looks long it's less than 10 minutes-- and once you're seated, service is quick.  Breakfasts are definitely of the "this is not healthy for you" variety, but it's good for a treat (I don't know how my kid made it through his cinnamon-swirl pancakes which were topped with the kind of glaze you put on cinnamon rolls, especially after he added syrup to it...)I drove past Scott's while looking for a place to purchase propane... Go figure.  Decided to stop in and sample their sweet treats. 

Cookies: definitely crunchy. I'm not a fan of a crunchy cookie - I prefer a chewier cookie, so Scott's cookies weren't quite what I had hoped they would be.

I decided to try a doughnut and selected a cream-filled chocolate iced doughnut. It was decent, but as someone else mentioned, about what you'd expect to find at a decent grocery store.

All things considered, I would probably go back for another doughnut, but I'd pass on the cookies. If you like a crunchy cookie, give 'em a try.

Oh; inside? Nice. Open, bright, clean, and the staff was very friendly.I had mentioned in a separate review that, per the website, this Pizza Pit doesn't have mac-and-cheese pizza. Well, I went to get some gyros (they have a mini greek restaurant inside, apparently, called Athens) and saw on the board that they DO have the mac/cheese pizza. I stand corrected. 

On to the gyros. The actual Greek restaurant in town is closed on Mondays, so we came here for our fix. We got gyros only, no fries (there aren't a lot of options, that might be it right there). They come with tomatoes and onions - I requested mine without onions. 

They were fine. Not stellar, not terrible. I've had better ones at a lot of places, but considering that I only had to drive ten minutes to get these, they were good enough. 

I was told 15 minutes, and when I got there 15 minutes (or so) later they were ready to go but still warm once I got them home and started devouring.I cannot recommend DQ's food. It is edible but not great. But who on earth goes here for anything but ice cream? They have a pretty good selection of grab-and-go stuff in the freezer by the door, and there is a drive-through. 

The inside is very small, and they close up for a month (I want to say January), I'm guessing for the owners to snowbird it. Every ice cream item I've ever gotten from here has been great. I had a pumpkin Blizzard in the fall that was DELISH. 

If you are the first car through the drive-through you should count your lucky stars. If you aren't the first then you might have quite a wait (understandable, since the car in front of you might be ordering Peanut Buster Parfaits for the entire marching band and you'd never know until it was too late). A couple of times I've dealt with employees who seemed to hate me and whatever I was ordering (the median age of these people seems to be about 19), but the ice cream was still great . Other times I've had extremely friendly and happy-seeming people at the window/register. Again, yummy ice cream.I'm usually very pleased with their customer service. However yesterday I felt pushed to make a purchase in the electronic department. He dropped stuff off the counter and I had to pick it up. He didn't even apologize. Overall dissatisfied with the service.Pretty decent. 
But I think all Chinese in Madison is pretty decent. 
Nothing has truly blown me away, this place included. 
While staff is nice and carryout is quick, food I ordered (veggie fried rice and Mongolian chicken) just didn't have much flavor. Like at all. The menu is extensive, though, and maybe I need to head back there to try more of it? They make a big claim that if you don't see it on their menu they'll find a way to make it, however that didn't hold true when I asked about Cantonese pan fried noodles... an item that seems near impossible to find in this town.Good food, slightly high prices.

I had the crawfish etouffee, my standard cajun dish.  It was quite good.  My brother had red beans and rice with sausage, which he loved.  Our friend had red beans and rice.  All were good.  No leftovers, but we were full.  The fresh lemonade was good; the maple bacon pralin was meh.Pedro's really only deserves two stars, but more on that later.  Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.  But there are some things on the menu that are perfectly fine should you find yourself here for some reason, at a loss as to what to order.  I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.  It will always have a special place in my heart, and I'll keep coming back most Tuesdays for trivia night.Pedros is a decent chain for Mexican Resturants, however it comes no where near the good authentic stuff you can have down south!

Starting off with the chips and salsa is always so good, but so filling, by the time my food comes, its all I can do to eat more!  The tortillas are also to die for, a little butter and they are heaven!

Chick Enchiladas Suiza are the only way to go! I always have a side of corn cakes as they are delicious!Wow, this place is so hit or miss. I'm honestly just not sure what I'll be getting for delivery each time I order (the same thing). They must have a different person cooking the stuff every single time because nothing ever comes to me the same as the last. 

I have had some great General Tso's here, and I have had some horrible way too spicy un eatable Tso's here. It's just so confusing.

I enjoy the lunch special the best. Most lunch specials are around $4.99 and come with fried rice (or white/just ask) and a egg roll. Great! It's enough food for a second meal for most. Who can beat that? Pretty much anything and everything is offered under this lunch special as well. What a deal!

Great egg rolls, Very good Rangoon! Awesome soups! 
Yet...like I said, you can't expect the same dish every time. It's a surprise to what quality of food will end up in front of you. 

Pretty quick delivery (usually around 25-30 minutes). 
Good sesame chicken, orange chicken, beef and broccoli.Ever the good steward of the Milwaukee County taxpayers, I booked this room for my two day training because it was considerably cheaper than the other options, coming in around $50 a night.  The rooms are small--I mean really, really small--and consist of a bed, small desk, TV and bathroom.  If you are really only going to be sleeping/showering in your room then this will be fine.  That being said, I was in a room on the backside of the hotel and the traffic from Washington Avenue was really noisy all throughout the night.  This is the place for the "no frills" seeker.Grade: C+

Yes, you read that rating correctly. Chalk this one up to a dare to see if I could eat 30 shrimp. Not a problem. Interesting clientle aside, this place was surprisingly not sucky.Typical Red Lobster.  Busy.  Good service. Food is delish.... cant get enough of those biscuits!My wife and I stopped at the Red Lobster on 7/4/13.  It was open and the parking lot was busy.  We started with the wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp.  It was really good.  A bottle of Kendall Jackson chardonnay made it even better!  We then shared a trio of wood fire salmon, shrimp skewers, and crab legs.  It came with a salad.  The flavors were fine.  The portions were small.  Our server was pleasant.  We'd return, but would probably  stay at the bar to enjoy a bottle of KJ with 2 orders of the  wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp and pass on the rest.Haven't been back for the fish fry for quite some time, but have been in for drinks and appetizers on numerous occasions since the last review of nearly 2 years ago.

+ One of the best craft beer lists in all of Madison; changes daily
+ Host tons of beer-related events and tap-takeovers
+ Even when swamped, you can usually find a seat at the bar or at a high-top
+ Service is quite prompt and thorough, but as noted, not super personable/friendly 

+ Hopalicious hummus remains one of my favorite plates in the area
- Not a huge fan of the pizzas; I've tried several and they're not all that awesome. Can't put my finger on it - something's just "off" with them.
+ Sandwiches are excellent
- Salmon salad has been hit-or-miss; often times, the salmon has been waaaaay undercooked (like still nearly frozen in the middle in spots). I think it depends on who's cooking that night.

+ Plenty of televisions, but they aren't "in your face" like they are at some bars
+ Accept credit/debit (a rarity in this neighborhood)Ahhhhh, "The land of &" A meal & a heart attack, or 1000 cc's of insulin. 

Never was a fan of Old Country Buffet, but the new revamp has brought some life into this old staple. 

It's still full of Blue Hairs and people who sport clothes that are covered w/ stains and holes. Also, if you are rotund like I am, your self-esteem will be boosted when you realize no matter how fat you are, their is always someone fatter at the Hometown Buffet. 

Food choices here are awesome. Mexican, American, Italian.... all piping hot and ready to pig on. The salad bar has surprisingly fresh veggies and staff works hard to keep the place clean and well stocked. Too bad every freakin kid in the place has to touch everything, wipe their hands on their nose, then bare hand the items. 

I even saw the staff kick some woman out for filling up an old "Country Crock" container w/ chicken wings. I guess takeout isn't allowed. LOL 

Good desert choices too. Soft serve and the usual box-made cakes and pies. The quality of the food won't win any awards. Not nearly as good as a freshly prepared 5 star meal, but better than prison. What do you expect for $9.95?If you are into buffets, try them out.  Food is diverse.  Food is hot .  Good flavor.  It's good for a family of picky eaters.If I could do 2.5 stars I would.

I pricelined this hotel in Madison and felt that it looked like a great place.  I  then read the reviews and I fretted the entire time before we arrived.  Luckily when we got there it wasn't as bad as I had anticipated.  The lobby is beautiful, the pool area is very nice, the pool was very large too.

The room was just ok.  I hate that they only have double beds or one king bed as bed options.  But, we were traveling with a two year old so the double beds worked as one of us slept with our son while the other got a bed to themselves.  The beds were not super comfortable, they felt like they had been around for quite some time. Our room had been remodeled but the wallpaper was peeling from the walls already.  I can promise that is because there is a serious humidity issue in this hotel.  Our room was CONSTANTLY damp.  We turned the air down to 68, we tried warmer, but to no avail, it just stayed damp.  When you laid your head on the pillow it felt damp.  The bad thing about this is we were staying here four days.  Our swimming suits never dried out the entire time we stayed at this hotel.  They ask that you turn off the AC when you leave the room and turn it back on when you return.  I refused to do that with the humidity issues that were present and yet the maid service turned our AC off two days we were there.  

There is a Starbucks in the hotel, but, I never once saw it open.  The pool area was lovely, but, it was quite cold when you initially got in, but once acclimated it was okay.  The hot tub was very hot.

Access was easy off the highway, close to the airport, but, Madison is doing major road construction on Washington and that caused a lot of delays at stoplights getting in and out of the hotel.Yeah, it's absolutely not hip, and yeah the customer service is not much, but this place has EVERY themed scrapbook sticker you've ever wanted. 

AND HOW MANY PLACES IN MADISON CAN SAY THAT?

That's a real question. In any case, this place can, and they've got a pretty nice selection of painting supplies, ribbon, gardening trinkets, sparkly things, probably inedible multicolored sprinkles, knitting tools, and fabric markers. Oh, and they have the whole Ace of Cakes line of baking supplies, even though the Food Network show was cancelled in 2011 (maybe they're worth something on eBay!). Mikey's is not the place to go for a personalized shopping experience, but is a great place to play the "how many things can I buy for $1" game.Honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about with Monty's.  It's certainly a staple of the Madison community, and the food is decent, but I find it overpriced, and the waits too long for the quality of the food.  Classic diner feel gives it a slight bump, but really, I think it's an average place, with average food.It is about the most vegetarian-friendly diner I've ever known. Some things on the menu are stellar -- like the tofu wrap and the yummy waffle fries -- and others are so-so. Is suppose that, as far as "diner" food goes, it's better than average, but you're not really paying "diner" prices... 

The staff always seems sort of out of it and not thrilled to interact with customers. We regularly wait long stretches to get some attention from our server once we are sat. But the faked-up old diner feels groovy and you always leave painfully full.Went here for Friday Night Fish Fry (after reading a decent review of the place from one of the fish fry ranking sites).  The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.

Great jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  

Drinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.

Food-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were "out of the box" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.

The fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.

But it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.

The fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so "off" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.

Villa Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie

Service = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)
Food = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)
Value = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)
Misc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)

Definitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!The "Ideal" dive bar... although the front room, with its grizzled clientele, was a bit sketchy, we found the back porch to be the perfect size for our large-ish group to lay claim to.The pizza here is OK, the staff here is friendly, and they have good daily deals.Grade: C-

I really hope that was chicken in my Chicken Lo-Mein. What happened to this place? What a dump. Good service but I kept wondering how old the huge mold stain on the ceiling was.Good bar food. Cash only . Seat yourself first come first sere. The walnut burger was decent and had the warm chips and blue cheese dips was not bad . Very cozy place with banquet style seating.It's been nearly a year since I've become somewhat of a "regular" here, so it's probably time for an update.

+ New ownership/management, effective sometime late last year
+ Same 'ole Harmony - big bar, plenty of seating, plenty of televisions

+ Decent tap list, ever-changing, although staples remain constant (Cow, PBR, Bells)
+ Appetizers are where it's at here. Pub chips, curds, etc - all are very good

- Specials are hit-or-miss; some are great, some are a bit less than great
- Pizzas; I'm not a huge fan of them. Too much cheese, sweet sauce, and just not super stellar. Pricey, to boot.

- Last visit was a bit funky, quite literally. It was quite sultry inside; as if the A/C wasn't on, or couldn't keep up. Then the Harmony's softball team arrived, fresh from an evening of playing... and the place started to funk-up, odor-wise. Adding insult to injury, the bar staff and kitchen became overwhelmed... I sort of agree with Chopper C's assessment of the male bartenders - they're quite surly and often seem very perterbed, especially when the place is busy like it was earlier this week. 

+ Pub chips were great, as usual
+ Marinated salmon Cesar salad was good; salmon a bit over-cooked and grey, but still tasty
+ Whitehouse Smoked Turkey sandwich was outstanding

- Cash only
- No Fish Fry on Fridays
- Odd hours/conditions around pizza availabilityRibs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet.  Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine. Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin.This is gonna be a difficult review to write and I don't want anyone to take it the wrong way.  Smoky Jons is good.  I mean, it's smoked, slow-cooked, sauce-covered, deliciously unctuous dead pig.  By nature, it's delicious and awesome and good for your soul.

But all barbecue is good.  Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.

I'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said "We should stop in here".  We finally did yesterday.

The interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.

After perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.

Smoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.

The sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.

Honestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.

I know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.

My favorite though?  No.

A-OK?  Yes, certainly.Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot.I have been served Gaylord Catering food more times than I care to remember and have always been disappointed.  Twice I became ill.   I am not exaggerating.   When Gaylord's shows up somewhere I get the coffee and a roll.
From my experience the dishes are always of the lowest quality.   
Note that everything looks ok but often the hot dishes are not hot. 
This is not criticism of the staff.  Just the quality of the food is always disappointing.

update: I was contacted by Gaylord Catering regarding my review.  I think this shows that the owners care about the quality of their food and service and that they have much more sense that many other businesses out there that seem to ignore their negative reviews and cannot even update and maintain a decent website.  (a whole other topic)
In response I want to better describe what I am referring to in my previous review.  Everything has always been neat and clean with Gaylord.  Their food has never had a bad or spoiled taste.  My illness has nothing to do with food poisoning or anything like that.  I have just felt nauseous for a while after eating their catered breakfasts.  I really think they need to change up their eggs, sausage and breakfast potatoes.  Everything looks ok but it never sits well with me for the next hour.
I have eaten some lunches that have been ok and I never became ill after eating a Gaylord's catered lunch.
As I briefly mentioned in my previous review the staff is at no fault.  In fact, Gaylord has always been on time, the staff is neat and professional and everything is presented nicely.

Anyone who is selecting a catering service should taste test a complete meal that is being served before ordering the service.   I have experienced some real nightmares at weddings, funerals and family reunions. Gaylord Catering has never presented a dish like some of the bad dishes I have been served over the years by other catering services.  I have been served raw meat in Milwaukee, spoiled fish in Waukesha, cold and two hour late food in southern Wisconsin, over salted meatballs in West Allis, tv dinner style food in Montana, seriously low quality seafood in Oregon, completely cold food in West Virginia and a 6 dollar meal for the cost of 20 in Madison,  Complaining about disappointing food at a catered meal is bad manners in my book so I just pass the poor servings and eat what I can.  But on Yelp I can express what my real experience was and I try my best to be as constructive and fair as possible.This is one of the times I really wish I could rate on half-stars. 

For selection, Mounds gets five stars. This location is not an overwhelmingly huge store like some of the big chain pet stores I've been to, and yet they manage to cram more variety of foods, toys, and supplies than any other store I've been to. I'm trying to switch my cats to a grain-free diet, and while the cats are resisting, Mounds has offered me lots of options! So wonderful.

I'm not actually familiar with Mounds as a company, but from the tiny bit of research I've done--and the newsletter they gave me--it looks like they are really working to make a difference in the Madison/Southern Wisconsin area. And for that, they at least deserve thumbs up. 

That said, this location is a bit hard to navigate. I had to wander through the dog food to find the cat food, and the toys were in a totally random spot. Once I found them, though, I was fine. I think the store could use a bit more lighting or something to make it feel a little less dungeon-like, but it's not like you're running around in the dark or anything, either.

As for service, I'm really split. This is where the half-star comes in. While the cashiers have always been friendly while I check out, and the first time I was there I had someone ask if I needed help finding anything (which was the time I didn't, as I was legitimately just wandering around), I've not had any additional offers of help, and the employees I see around the store seem a bit stand-offish. That said, it could just be I was there on a few bad days, as the cashiers were super friendly, so it's not horrible customer service, either.The jerk pork is the best around.  Couple it with the vegetables (zag cut cabbage, carrots etc, lightly cooked but still crunchy and spiced)  and you have an awesome combination that makes a great sandwich too.  The staff are very friendly and would get better marks but for the atmosphere.   We totally expected casual (no worries mon).  Clean, but a little sprucing up would go a long way.  Fresh ceiling tiles and light bulbs.  The old Taco Bell menu screens would make for a great mural canvas.This is close to a four star restaurant as far as burger places go.  It is part burger joint and part sports bar.  It is a bit too busy for me with all the "flare" on the walls or whatever you want to call it.  The food is always hot, flavorful and excellently presented.  Prices are inexpensive and reasonable.  Restaurant is very clean including the bathrooms.  Staff has always been terrific.  I can do without the Birthday song.  Hate that.
The burgers seem to have gone downhill a bit.  Not as large as they used to be.   Still good flavor.   The salads are smaller now too.   A friend of ours was accommodated very well recently by their manager for a meal that was subpar.   Hats off for that.  Ultimately they need to bring their food back to where it once was.I do really like RR for the kids.  Lots to look at.  They like to "play" with the games. I got the Blue Ribbon Burger- very good.  I also love the bottomless fries- we always get them right away.  Speaking of fries they need to go back the basket fries and not the the metal containers.  These containers are WAY to fancy for Red Robin.  
My husband who is a vegetarian also liked there burgers that you can sub with a veggie burger- he likes the Burning love.
The con... the service is slow.  They really need to work on the service.Bottom line -  if you NEED to see your football game, this bar will have it guaranteed.  Seating is a bit limited, so get there at least an hour early to get a decent seat in front of your screen.  If you can go to a Champps, you'd be better off there.
Not a bad spot to watch a Vikings game in Madison.  There will be only two games with audio at once, one of them will always be the packers.  Many TVs, but there will be one, maybe two screens to watch your game - most tvs are about 30 inches.  Food is ok.  Cheese curds were great, nachos were nothing special, wings are mediocre at best.  Frosty mugs for your beer was a nice touch.  Free popcorn too.  Grub is cheap (nachos, wings, pitchers of beer $25)
The one problem I had was that we only had one 32-inch screen (with audio) for about 30 vikings fans, and they cornered us in the game room next to air hockey and basketball arcade games, so it was an annoying distraction to listen to that all game.  You would think they'd show at least two screens in that room for us. For fellow vikes, you get a great community mn experience.solid food....very good service and kid friendly....a sure spot in the dells rotation.UPDATE 5/19/2008

Finally. Me and the Thaiger are purring like happy kittens. I've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish! Prices are insanely low, tho the lunch menu is limited. Service is upbeat and more polished. Now, a purrrrfect place for me to lunch!!! Hello Kitty!!!!

I think Hello Kitty is wildier than this cat. 
Veggie tempura. I've had crispier wafers from a priest. 

Pad Thai. Wouldn't say it was bad, but, hmmm, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh, I know BLAND! I've had tastier wafers from a priest. 

I love the chef. Very approachable and like, totally, super nice.

 Wait staff, on the two occasions I've been there, were a little inactive. I've had more action from a priest. 

I'll go again. Try new things. But only after I do the Rosary.Well...mixed bag!

Went with a buddy on a Wednesday night and the place seemed to be hopping...maybe a bit too busy as the service was pretty bad.  We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.  

We had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!

My buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a "medium heat" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something "healthy" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted "off" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.

I had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).

So...hit and miss...but I will try it again.Pad Thai & Springs rolls are pretty tasty! I can't say I was blown away, but it was definitely good. I order one single Spring Roll, and I guess they accidentally made it a full order (4 Spring Rolls)... Well they went ahead and just gave them to me for the price of one. Pretty sweet! It's the little things...First time at Wild Thaiger. Had lunch on a Saturday early afternoon with my wife and daughter. 
It was 95 degrees but the patio was pleasant. We ordered Thai iced teas, which took a while to arrive. I don't think our waiter thought the patio was pleasant. 

My wife ordered the GF Pad Thai, our daughter ordered the Tofu Curry and I got Dragon Eggs and Phuket Fantasea. Lunch arrived after 25 minutes, a bit long for lunch. 

The Pad Thai was good. All the elements were served apart from each other, so you could mix ingredients as you wish - nice touch. The Curry and Fantasea were both good as well. 

The prices were fairly steep though. My Dragon Eggs (dumplings) were $9 and the Phuket Fantasea was $18. All-in-all, the bill was $60+ plus tip. That's a pricey lunch, even for Thai food. 

I may try it again, going with less expensive dishes and hope for better service.I came in right when they opened. There was quite a line before they opened, and even once we got in it took a bit for us to get any sort of service. 

I ordered the Gaprao Gai. They really don't mess around with their heat level. Be careful! The dish itself was very tasty, and once the lunch rush calmed down service was wonderful (and constant enough to get my water filled up often).

All in all, tasty food, good service. If you are in the area it is worth a shot. Otherwise there are better Thai places around the valley (Chanpen comes to mind...).you get what you pay for. At $89 a night and you can comfortably split with three people and not have to share a bed with someone (as long as you're not married).  The bathrooms and showers could have afforded to be power washed.  But I was basically there to sleep and shower, so I could have done worse.  Nice people working the desk though.The closest conventional grocery store to where I currently live.  While not the best it meets my needs and keeps me from having to brave the distance to go to Walmart or Target for my other non-food items for the most part.  
I also get some of my prescriptions filled here and having a Safeway Card saved me a few bucks that even my insurance could not.  
Most of the employees here have been quite courteous and helpful.Ate here with a group of work associates while staying across the street for a conference. Service was very good - our waiter handled the large group with ease, which doesn't always happen.

The chips and salsa are unlike any I've had anywhere else and they were totally addictive! My end of the table demolished our bowl in minutes and then grabbed the one from the other end. 

The entrees left a bit to be desired, however. Lots of seafood - which just doesn't seem right in the desert. I would have liked more traditionally tex-mex dishes to choose from as I eventually settled on the enchilada and carnitas platter, which was OK. 

All things considered, it was a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back next time business brings me to Phoenix.I had dinner here at the end of a long week of conference meetings. Compared to the fast food, food court, and hotel fare I'd eaten throughout the week before, this was a fabulous meal. Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it.

Primary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish.

Positives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish. 

Service-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome.A couple friends and I went here after searching for a dinner place around 9pm on a weeknight. Much of downtown Phoenix closes up shop early during weekdays so it was good to find a place that was open with some life to it.

We were quickly seated and ordered some margaritas. They brought out chips and salsa that were actually very tasty. The chips are brushed with some sort of chipotle spice and served with chipotle salsa as well.

For my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas which were decent, but nothing to write home about. All of the portions were pretty large, but I still felt that the prices were a bit high considering the quality of food.

The service was friendly and relatively speedy and they even gave us a little palette cleansing dessert to complete the meal.

Overall, this place is a good place to get your fix for margaritas and Mexican food in Phoenix, but just be prepared to pay a little higher price than you are probably used to.I was a student here starting 6th grade till I transferred out after 8th grade.

I'm going to review what I remember!

This is a very small performing arts school. When I was there they had an average of about 400 students from 6-12th grade.

Morning classes (7:45am - 12:15pm) are normal academics. Performing arts are in the afternoon till 2-3pm depending on the classes. 

For middle school:
Piano is a required class during the morning.
Performing arts options are voice & an instrument (this includes strings I believe), OR ballet (offered off campus with transportation by the school).
Guitar is available after 6th grade.
Jazz band & percussion ensemble is available by audition only after 6th grade.
Drama is more of an after school program & has a fee. 

For high school:
Students choose 2-3 classes from music (instrument, voice or piano), OR drama, OR ballet.

To get in there was a waiting list. Or was it first come first serve? Either way, be sure to put your kids name down or be there when they first open with all the necessary paper work. The slots are limited. Remember, the school is SMALL!

I hear they are trying to remodel & expand. When I went there the school rented space from the church, but is in no way affiliated religiously. Other space was across the street. Yes, you cross the street back & forth to get from 1 class to the next. They even had the rule, "No hugging in the crosswalk." That says something about the students lol

Concerts were held in Pilgrim Hall or the actual church. Pilgrim Hall is where lunch can be eaten or a band class is held in the afternoon. Other students eat in the courtyard. A lunch truck (roach coach) came so students could purchase a lunch if they didn't bring their own.

This school had a high turn over of teachers. Every year about 25% of the faculty would either be fired or quit. That's actually a lot of teachers. This may not be the case anymore since the school officials have changed. There are teachers still teaching that I recognize from when I went there:
- Leah Fregulia-Roberts (Head of School) used to be the pricipal
- Brian Hawkins (11th & 12th Grade Math)
- Kyle Kirkman (7th & 8th Grade Math) taught me
- Diane Legge (5th Grade Piano) taught me piano when there was no 5th grade
- Kristin Mailhiot (Vice-Principal) used to be a middle school science teacher

Students who either go to this school during HS or graduate stay involved. I would know, I'm friends with a lot of them on Facebook. They stay arts oriented a lot of the time & still talk about things currently going on at ASA.

So, why did I leave? There are a few reasons.
- I wanted a big HS experience.
- I wanted to go to school with more than 400 students.
- I wanted life lessons. I didn't want to be sheltered. I wanted to see how the real world worked.
- I wanted to go to a school where there was more than 2 guys to every 10 girls. And where those guys weren't gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. But I like boys, gay boys aren't interested in girls. See where I'm going with this?
- I wanted to get away from the 5 hours of homework every night. I was constantly exhausted. I was 11, 12, & 13. I was still a kid. I missed my time to play... & sleep.
- I wanted to get away from teachers who taught opinions instead of facts. Yes, this happened. Yes, I told him he was wrong for doing so. Yes, he hated me for it.
- I hated playing an instrument. I didn't have time to practice after all that homework. I can't sing. Anything I was interested in wasn't available till a later year. Blah blah blah... I'm not creative. Honestly, I'm not.
- I wanted more options. Different types of friends. Maybe to go to school with more than 95% white kids.

What did I like?
- I kept friends I made in middle school to this very day.
- The teachers are smart & actually make friends with their students.
- I usually loved the required summer reading choices.
- I love how close the Burton Barr library is. Spent almost every day after school there. I knew people who worked there & am still friends with them.My pub crawl compadres and I stopped at Majerle's after having a brief but terrible experience at Networks. I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? 

We attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?

Anyway, I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game, but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food, cheaper drinks, and friendlier service.Yea a pretty good sports bar.  Nice staff and good wings (been there only once).  There's a front bar and a rear bar for overflow.I stayed here once in July (didn't know the fan was what would keep us cool at the time) because it was close to an event at the Orpheum that I was attending very early the next morning and I got a super cheap deal. 

I thought the place had charm and was told of the about the ghosts who haunt the place and all the celebrities who had once stayed here at check-in. Fun place to stay if you're doing something downtown, but not anywhere I would stay if I was looking to book a nice relaxing weekend.hotel historique qui a vu passer Marylin et Clark Gable pas un peu vétuste , bien placé mais personnel peu sympa , parking cher ( 20 dollars) et petit dej nul...l'hotel serait hanté , la légende est sympamas nous n'avons pas rencontré "la" fantômeLocation was clean. Service was fast. Staff was friendly, and at unholy hour of 5:30 A.M, I think that deserves special recognition.  Got big, filling breakfast with coffee for $10+tip.  I have had more spectacular breakfasts but this was good, tasty, filling, and an improvement over last time I ate at this same location quite some years ago.  I'm fairly sure there are no hand-picked-by-the-chef truffles personally-massaged-with-organic-certified-prepubescent extremely virginal olive oil or the like on the premises, but see above: tasty, filling, clean, fast & friendly, $10, and an improvement from last, long-ago visit.  It's may not be "destination-dining", but I'd hop in again.I went with a group from work.  We had 7 of us.  We were seated pretty quickly.  The menus are huge and lots of things to pick from.  Yeah, I noticed all the dishes are pretty BIG.  The service was quick and pretty good.  I ordered the chicken fingers with fries.  Their batter is little coated and crispy.  The chicken was still moist.  All in all, it was good.I've been here for lunch once.  When I went the weather was beautiful and sitting outside near the garage, was outstanding.  The atmosphere is nice and down to earth, with a dash of trendy.  The food was slightly above average.Am I a snob about Asian food? Yup. Can't help it. I grew up in NYC, where Chinatown has real Chinese people. I lived for a decade in San Francisco, which has arguably the best Asian food in the US. I had a Korean girlfriend who was attending the culinary institute, and I happily volunteered to be her guinea pig (yeah, for her cooking too). And I spent a lot of years traveling all over the US and Europe, so I'm sufficiently jaded. 

I also have to say, I've tried lots of restaurants since moving to AZ four years ago, and I've come to the conclusion that, just as the Germans can't do decent Mexican food, AZ suffers a dearth of decent Asian restaurants. 

That said....Fate is pretty good by AZ standards. Put it in SF and it wouldn't last a week, but here, it stands tall. The atmo is funky to the point of trying-too-hard. I like the support-yer-local-artist concept, sure. I like the rustic, we're too cool for carpeting decor. But fer chrissakes, would it kill you to slap a coat of paint on the walls, or sand down the splinters on the floor? 

Sure, I'd eat there again....but I'd rather just grab a good Asian fusion meal when I'm out of town.I came here for lunch yesterday with my mama. This place is tiny but it definitely has character. There were 2 people sitting outside & 3 people inside, so they weren't exactly busy. We sat close to the bar & listened to a couple guys playing guitars & a woman sang a couple songs. My mom put $5 in their tip jar & one of the guys came over to give us a flyer & chat, he was so sweet. For our meals: mama ordered the panini italiano & I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, for sides she chose the house salad & I chose the potato salad. Mom enjoyed her meal, as did I, but I had to salt the potato salad & even that didn't help-it was pretty blah. I took half of mine & half of my mama's sandwich home for hubby, he liked both but said mom's was better. Total for both meals including drinks was $22. One thing that was a lil annoying was how slow the service was. Our server was very nice but it took 30 minutes just to get our food, which seemed way too long for a place that only had 7 customers total. It was pretty good food though, so I'd probably return.Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation, but after a long day of sightseeing, if you want to just sit down and get some Mexican and a few coronas without having to go back to the hotel and shower and get dressed up, this place will do. I think it's a bit more pricey then Sam's Place next door, but check the menus on line.Where this isn't the gourmet Mexican fiesta heaven you're probably just dying to try. It wasn't re-fried bean heck either. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, it's very typical American Grill meets what it thinks Mexico should look like complete with booths and tacky wall colors.  But they will make semi-fresh guacamole at your table and bring you a mountain of chips that you can't refuse. 

They were also pretty knowledgeable about what was gluten free on their menu. Stay away from the yellow rice, but try the white, it's delicious.Average food, convenient location and decent prices.  Good place for a quick bite or a casual dinner.I ate here twice during my stay in Phoenix last week and I can't say too many bad things about it. Prices were decent, food had flavor and it filled me up. Was it the best Mexican food I've ever had? Absolutely not, however it definitely wasn't nasty! The service was A-OK and the food hit the spot. I would definitely go back again.The ever climbing prices and dissapearing grillied onions have casued me to not visit here as much.

Luckily the light rail constrtion is a thing of the past and one can esialy approce this location.

The line to order inside can be a bit akward as there is not much room for it.

On my last trip I went with the grilled veggie burrito as the cheaper bean and cheese burrito now only exists in my memories. It comes with a few chips.

I do enjoy the salsa bar that has sweet and savory salsas cilantro and little peppers.

The food is decent but for a $7 lunch there are cheaper better Mexican options out there.Wings were good of course, but the kitchen could use some work. Too long of a wait for food.The food is great, the decor is so-so. Sometimes I wonder how long it's been since some of the display items have been cleaned. Makes me a little leary of what other corners they might be cutting, but have never really had a problem with food quality of service.Damn, these portions are huge. The garlic bread is to die for, and the pasta is just the right amount of filling. The food isn't the best quality, but it's got quantity and it is satisfying. That's all one could really ask for as far as I'm concerned.Not the greatest pasta out there. But then again, what is? I enjoyed the "Manager's Favorite," where you can pick two of their five sauces. I went with White Clam Sauce and Mizithra Cheese and Browned Butter. Definitely very buttery. Like Paula Deen buttery.

The interior is fun. We sat inside a train or cable car of some sort. Not much else to say. Decent dinner. Decent prices.Eh...ok here is the deal. They were maybe smart to stick with dishes that are impossible to toally screw up. The two dishes reccomended by our server (Eliseo, who was a dream by the way) were fish and chips, and the burger. Neither sucked...but neither made me go wow. The cole-slaw was not very tasty to me or my dining companion. It sortof tased like the mouthful of Aqua-net I would get as a child when walking into the cloud of it while my mom got ready in the morning. The 80s were strong with chemicals...

Here is what I do like...in a proper spot downtown, this is basically a little diner that serves booze. Yeah I had a beer with my burger and it was awesome! When pressed for time before a show at the Orpheum I was still able to have drinks and a meal without doing bar food. Yes the menue is limited but it is food.  

The place has a lot more potential than kinetic going for it but Eliseo was such a dream (and I had beer) that I can comfortably give it 3 stars.This is a pretty chill spot for drinks & bar food.  We went on a Sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the Phoenix Convention Center.  They were able to accommodate a group of about 20 of us without any issues (not a whole lot of people there).  

Their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and I could not help reaching for the nachos again and again, but definitely avoid their Caesar salad (I know, who orders salad at a bar anyway?!)I was downtown after my class at ASU and thought I would stop by on my way home to Scottsdale to get my car washed. 

My car was cleaned pretty well on the outside. Some water stains upon leaving, but whatever. I was mostly disappointed with the way they did the inside. I have two yellow labs that ride with me lots and lots, so there was a considerable amount of hair in the backseat. I told the attendant that I would pay extra if they would get the hair off the seats. I was told it wouldn't be a problem, yet when my car was ready, it looked like both of my dogs had exploded in the backseat. I had them redo it to my liking. I shouldn't have to ask twice when I'm paying extra to begin with. 

On a positive note, they do offer a $2 discount to ASU students.Went in for weekday lunch. There are a lot of options. I got a half sandwich (the Americana ciabatta?? That's what I thought I ordered but the website tells me there's nothing called that...) and was a little weary of the $5.50 price - however, when it arrived, it was the size of a full sandwich with lots of meat and toppings. Also, the sodas have free refills. 
Some drawbacks was the parking - there's no where close and it's all pay - and the tables were really sticky. I didn't see anyone wiping them down so who knows how dirty they were?Zoe's is fine, clean and simple with just enough trendiness to make you feel better about yourself for coming here than a fast food restaurant.   Our food was plain and simple, chicken kabobs and a quesadilla.   I guess we should have tried the lime ade and the cake, maybe next time, and then I'll give then another star.If you're looking for a quazi-healthy, fast casual lunch spot, Zoes is your spot. It's easy and great for a work week lunch. It's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good (not great), it does the trick and won't break the bank.  

I usually get the chicken salad sandwich which carmelized onions. My girlfriend always gets the protein plate which looks good too. Plus, every item comes with chips and a side of your choice (slaw, potato salad, pilaf, etc.)

My favorite part about Zoe's you ask? That Diet Dr. Pepper is part of the soda fountain selection. Divine.Hard Rock is just okay.  I have actually been to many many Hard Rocks, but not always to eat.  Usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn't that good.  The food is never bad, it's just never that good.

Almost ever single time we go here, which I swear is too often, I order the Twisted Mac and Cheese.  I get this for two reasons.  One, I love mac and cheese, and two, I love cavatappi pasta.  HR's version of the classic cheesy pasta is a mildly spiced cheese sauce that lightly coats the curly pasta.  Don't expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here.  You won't be getting that.  The pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken.  Why expected?  It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.

Why I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.  Maybe they put crack in the mac.  That would explain why I order it time and time again.  If you haven't been, I suggest going just once.  It's fun to compare all the different HR's.I have never been to the Hard Rock Cafe before so I personally enjoyed the decor. Our waiter was hilarious and I loved my Granny Smith burger. The portions were big and I had a lot of fun.This review is for the south building of the Phoenix Convention Center. I was there for a one day conference what I was also on the committee for. 

Overall the convention center could use some better signage. Most of the time you aren't sure which building you are at until you are at the dropoff lane directly in front of it looking at the main doors. I had to call two people and drive around and stop in front of two buildings before I found the south one. Granted, I could've looked ahead of time, but you businesses can't count on that.

Once I got there, finding actual parking for the convention center was hard. I think I ended up in Chase Field's parking.

The building is nice and clean but small. The size suited us well, but there was a lack of easy access to food other than the one cart. Would've been nice to have other offerings even if we weren't in a newer and bigger portion of the center. 

The staff was friendly from the few interactions I had and the rooms were decent sized. However, when the air was turned on, there was a buzzing sound in every room that was similar to a vacuum being ran. Had to deal with it unless you wanted to sweat. 

Wifi not being free is also a bummer.Great space. Came to pick up my bib for the R&R Marathon. Stopped at Tortilla's Mexican Food inside and it was delicious! Chicken taco plate was pretty good!The Phoenix Convention Center offers a great meeting and venue space - it is large and your meeting possibilities are endless here.  It was also very convenient for us because we stayed at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown (just a 5-minute walk up the street).

The waitstaff themselves were very friendly, kind and helpful to us.  They assisted us with our requests and helped us to navigate the space.  Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the Banquet Manager.  He wasn't the easiest to work with: speaking to us in condescending tones, telling us stuff that wasn't true (i.e., buffet was already replenished, but no food was there) and deny any wrongdoing on his team's parts.  

Our meeting was still successful and the space was great, but I definitely feel that some personnel improvements can be made.I've been to several events/conferences at the Phoenix Convention Center.  The facility is nice and modern with spacious pre-function areas and a nice selection of food options.  There's a Crust Pizza that serves up Pastas and Pizza for quick eats.  That's my favorite outlet to grab lunch or a snack if I don't like what the conference meal program offers.

The worst part about attending an event here is the parking.  Your choices are underground self parking garages that range from $6-$12 per day.or if the conference/event pays for a valet service, you might have that option for a fee.  There's also parking at area hotels that costs $ too and can be quite a walk. 

Once you get inside it's easy to get turned around trying to figure out what side of the building you're on.  The directional signage is not very good.  It takes me a couple of days to get oriented when attending a large conference here.

Overall, the experience is pretty average for a convention center.

Return Factor - 60%I attended a week long Salesforce training session at this location.  Staff was nice.  Class was small, which was choice. The instructor was independent, contracted through Salesforce.  The first two days of class, we had a bucket of juices offered in the back of the class room.  I wondered why there was no water included and why the bucket disappeared after day two.  There were always bagels and fruit offered in reception but I was never offered any and didn't know if they were available to us.  The receptionist brought in cookies, every  day at 2pm.  The instructor eventually told us that we could get water and soda out of the cooler in the hallway.  That was a saving grace since we were stuck in this dark room for intense training all day long. 

Location is good and they have plenty of parking.  I attended in the peak of summer heat in Arizona and was cool and comfy all day.Arizona Center is a great IDEA, but a not so great reality. The tourist-y stores here selling "authentic" Arizona / Southwest merchandise are a joke. New York & Company is one of the few stores on the otherwise vacant second floor. (Which totally doesn't fit with the rest of the mall)

The design of the place is nice, and decent restaurants dot the complex. What really bumps this place form 2 to 3 stars are the beautiful gardens and fountains surrounding it. Oh, and AMC!

But Arizona Center will not prosper until Downtown Phoenix has a strong pedestrian crowd and a heavy use of the Light Rail. The location is fabulous, but it just doesn't work.The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore."Do you like Mother Nature?" This question came after the check. It was on the heel of a discussion about mountain biking and camping. South Mountain. Camelback. San Francisco Peak. He liked it all. In fact, he liked to talk. He being the owner, I mean. 

My friend and I arrived around 5:30 for dinner. We were greeted right away and shown a table. Our Kirin Lights shortly followed. The sushi menu offered nigiri, sashimi and their roll selection, which included one called "Phoenix Suns." The owner soon embarked on striking up a conversation with us. His English was somewhat broken, though. I let my friend do the talking. I added, "We'll trust you" when it was decided that we'd let him pick a roll for us and put together a sashimi platter. 

While we waited, we sampled the miso soup and drank our beer. Soon, a brightly colored roll came to our table. "Spicy Slim" is what we were told it was. We had no idea what it was, until the owner came over later to chat some more. Crab on the inside, tuna on the outside - covered in spicy sauce. Well then. It was pretty tasty, especially with the coating (like small, white crunchy flakes). It got pretty spicy the more you ate. 

Soon the sashimi came. We had peppered and seared salmon (yum), extra white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail and salmon. Each piece was very good. The sizes were generous, too. The sahsmi came with two small dipping bowls, too. Sort of a mild spicy sauce, an alternative to soy. The sauce was a great complement to the meal. 

My friend wanted more. Man, she can pack it away! So, we ordered some mackeral nigiri and a caterpillar roll. The mackerel was very good, although I thought the rice it laid on was a bit too sticky - hard to chew. The caterpillar roll was good, though. It was your basic eel meets avocado. The eel sauce was sweet without being overly sweet and overpowering the taste of the roll. 

Overall, a great meal! The service was also great - although a bit too attentive. Considering we were the only patrons (minus a couple sitting at the sushi bar), they were just waiting around to serve us. In fact, they tried to take our miso soups away twice before we were actually finished. 

Also, there was the chattering - the owner striking up a conversation after we paid, when we are about to get up from our seats. First it was about basketball, since on the big screen I saw that it was about to be Bedlam (Oklahoma State vs. OU). Funny, considering I went to OSU and my friend is a big Sooners fan. I think the owner wanted to see us throw down. Who knows. In any case, basketball talk soon turned to travel (Hawaii was a hot topic) and the outdoors. We gradually weened the conversation to a flutter and left. 

As we were pulling away, my friend said, "Oh god, he's outside waving to us." It was true. He was outside, alright, bidding us adieu. Some may call that spectacular service. I think that was over doing it a bit much. Yet, what else had he to do? It seems the FBR had devoured most of his dinner patrons. Besides, he did admit that Ichi Ban is more of a hot lunch spot for the surrounding businesses. 

As for the bill, it came to about $100. True, we did order some more expensive fish (like the white tuna), but it was not worth $50 a person. No way, no how. Especially since you felt like you stumbled upon an obscure shopping plaza and into a sushi diner, not a restaurant. (Case in point: They have a seperate counter to take orders for teriyaki rice bowls and the like.) The decor didn't so much bother me, though. It was the extra attention. I guess I just don't like being spoiled (that's one way to look at it). 

Plus, the owner is Korean. We know this because they were speaking to each other in another language, and my friend picked up on it. He was Korean alright. She should know. She married one.eating at honey bears is like having an average-looking girlfriend. you're thankful for all the good times you've had, but you have this suspicion that if you looked around you'd find something better. pulled pork sandwich is decent, but the bun is soggy. ribs are tasty but stringy. the "hot link" sandwich tastes like a sliced up hot dog. best things there are the fries and the BBQ sauce, which actually go quite well together. make sure you check your take out order before you leave, they've been known to get things wrong.Used to live in the neighborhood here and frequent Honey Bear's quite often. My favorite night to go is Friday, when you can get a big bucket of delicious rib tips for very little scratch. The sauce is amazing, and has just the right amount of vinegar, I'm salavating just thinking about it. It's definitely a dive, and you will always see a bum inside, and the bathrooms are ridiculously disgusting. The staff is rude, and not very helpful, and even a couple of times a 10 year old took my order. All of it is made up for by the great food. The ribs, tips, sandwiches, and brisket are all awesome and well executed. I just don't want to know what their health report looks like.Pretty good BBQ for Phoenix!  I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese...quite tasty!  The atmosphere is not very appealing and the advertising is quite cheesy, but guess it did make me laugh!My husband and I love the ribs and the pulled meat sandwich trio. Their BBQ sauce is great. My husband has told me that fridays are rib tip day but they are always out when we get there. My negative would be that we Sally do to go orders and three times they've messed it up and that they're always out f rib tips on Friday.I recently ate some BBQ ribs and coleslaw, only to find out it came from Honey Bear's. I'm not sure if they changed recipes or cooks, but it certainly tasted better than it did in the past. There was more meat on the bone and the sauce wasn't overwhelming.Cheuvront, as the name appears, is evidentially not French, as I first theorized.  The only thing remotely French here was the Filet Mignon that was part of the customized menu for the Birthday Event I attended.

The scene here was kind of refreshing compared to many places in the Valley.  It's not everyday you can sip on fine wine, munch on exotic cheese and hear the sounds of a LIGHT passenger train swift by.

One of the best parts of the venue was actually mingling within the cool exclusive, private area where you can lounge on sofas or sit on high chairs at your tables that seated four.  Interestingly, they had these transparent curtains that kind of snaked around each table creating almost an intimate feel.  It was even more so that the lighting was set to dim with candle lights and modern pendant lighting hovering the tables.

The true highlights went to the food.  I started my night with a Mango Mojito! It was an excellent, tasty drink BUT where was the alcohol? Did they run out?! Ahh! $8 for a virgin-like drink?! I did feel ripped off, however, they won me over with:

Apps:

* Warm fresh baguette!
* Pâté: super good!

Main Entrées:

* Nicely prepared DUCK breast over very flavorful risotto with some crunchy asparagus pieces (style points with the artsy presentation!)

* The orange glazed SALMON had this nice surface texture while the inside remained moist and tender.  The Fingerling Potato Wedges, surprisingly, complemented it very well.

Lastly, they were very courteous to help slice and box (any leftover) a Birthday Cake that was brought from outside.  Extra points for added service.

Overall, it was a great venue to have a nice, cozy dinner with your closest friends in an urbanesque setting.The food was good. I enjoyed my salmon. I loved the cake. The dessert cheese plate was good. I did not like ambience. We sat at a high table. The metal stools are slippery causing me and my wife to have to readjust every few minutes. The table was awkward for dinner but might be fine for happy hour. 

My only gripe is the ambience. For the money I want it to feel classier.Apparently, this place is only hot when a game is on.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and there were only 5 other patrons.  The place is huge, so it looked even more pathetic than it sounds.  

I got the Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale, a locally brewed amber beer that was quite flavorful and not too bitter.  They have a good selection of beers on tap including imports and domestic.  I had already eaten dinner, so I didn't attempt to indulge in the Big Unit, but checked out the menu just for yuks.  Quite a variety of options and most meals seem to be named after a certain person.  Cute touch.  But no assignment of credit for who inspired the big unit...

All the staff here have black teardrops ala Alice Cooper.  Lots of guitars on the walls and three HUGE TV screens above the bar.  Outdoor seating and music blasting in and outside.

Thanks to Jim B. for the recommendation to come here.  It gave me conversation fodder :)Novelty, Novelty, Novelty.

Sure, this place is a gigantic novelty. Alice Cooper themed.
It's a HUGE restaurant with big screens everywhere, a full bar, a nice giant outdoor seating area, too.
The waiters come out with make-up like Alice Cooper, as well.
It's quite the sight, but unfortunately, I was never a huge Alice Cooper fan [not to say I dislike Alice Cooper, I was just never that into him.]
So, obviously, that isn't what brought me here.
What brought me to Cooperstown was their claim of having the "Longest Hot Dog in the World!"
I'm all about gimmicks and I will absolutely put down $15 for a gimmick dog, especially because I love finding unique hot dogs.

I went down to Cooperstown, got seated, make-up clad waitress asks me what I'd like and I tell her I'll have the 2 foot long hot dog: To-Go, please. She looks at me strangely and then leaves with my order. My two friends didn't eat anything.

About fifteen to twenty minutes later, a big red light flashes and an alarm goes off, which draws everyones attention to the door by the kitchen. Just then, my waitress enters the dining hall with a 2 foot tinfoil spear, which she placed in front of me. I was happy with the size, to say the least. I opened it up, threw on some ketchup and took a bite before leaving.

I let my friends try it, as well, and we all agreed, the dog was juicy and delicious! The main issue I had with it, though, was the bun. The bun was simply a baguette. It was very hard and definitely not like eating a hot dog.

If this place wants my extra 2 stars, they'll have to invent a softer 2 food bun to go with this [did I mention the hot dog actually sticks out on both sides of the baguette, it was huge!]

Aside from my hot dog,  the service was a little slow and the place, though blasting music, was somehow empty, stale, and awkwardly quiet. It's likely because it's such a huge space occupied by so little.

Either way, it's definitely worth the experience, but I'd go in the evening when there's possibly more atmosphere around.I want to love you, Alice Cooperstown, I really do. I have a few friends that actually work here-unfortunately none of them were my server. And the whole "Big Unit" thing.. I get it.. and it wouldn't have been so bad if someone wasn't ordering one every few minutes! Lol. 

My boyfriend and I went here recently after going to Body Worlds @ the Arizona Science Center. The place itself is really rad, I love the decor and the idea of mixing a sports bar with rock & roll memorabilia. My boyfriend ordered the "Tom Brady" burger and I ordered the "Sun Devils Clubhouse" sandwich. Our food was pretty good, however our service was not so great. After we finally got our food, our server just never came back to check on us. Although she did walk by a few times, so I really didn't get that. She only stopped by once we were done to drop off the check. That was a big turnoff. 

I'd go back, as long as I don't get the disappearing act server again.After a year and a half of living in the Valley, I finally made it to US Airways twice in March - once for the Cavs/Suns game and once for the Elton John/Billy Joel Face to Face concert. For the Suns game, I went with two girlfriends and we drove...parking was super easy and convenient in a garage and it was only $10. Sweet. For the concert, my husband and I took light rail and it ran late that evening. Double sweet. Walking around downtown around 5:45 pm the evening of the concert, parking near US Airways was running about $20-25.

The atmosphere outside before the Suns game was awesome - live band playing and different things set up for kids and kids at heart alike. Getting in for the game was really easy and quick; for the concert, not so much. It was a huge clusterf*ck and while at times there was semblences of lines, really it was just people pushing toward the door. Once inside, both times, I really wished there was better signage and directions on which way to head. I have been to better looking arenas, but the worst part about the setup for US Airways is that the walkways, especially on the second level, are quite narrow for the amount of people that were at both events, so it gets way too congested to even walk.

The concession stand choices are horrid. My two girlfriends and I set out to find something to eat prior to the Suns game beginning and we finally had to settle for Subway. The concession stand choices that we saw were pizza, nachos, pretzels, and candy. No fries. No burgers. No chicken tenders. Definitely make sure to eat at one of the restaurants around the arena before heading in. 

For the Suns game, we sat in section 225 which is a corner section. For buying the tickets two days prior to the game for $53 each, we were really happy with our seats and the view. We didn't miss any of the action and even from section 225, row 10, Shaq looked HUGE. We didn't feel too far away at all and we had perfect views of the court and the scoreboards. For the concert, we were in section 219 which is on the side. Seats were pretty decent...we could see the stage really well, but lights blocked our view of some of the screens. Acoustics for the concert were a bit lacking, but I'm not sure if that was due to the equipment the tour had or if it is because of the venue.

I wouldn't run back to US Airways for a concert, but will definitely go to another Suns game. People were totally into the game and it was nice to see people watch the whole game and stand up and cheer. I felt this venue is good for basketball, but for concerts, it was just OK.This review is pretty late. Just clearly out my camera. 

Well I went to watch a Suns game here with my brother. Driving up to the area was very easy. We didn't hit our first problem til we got out the car - tickets. I purchased tickets online and was told to go to the ticket booth to pick up. 

I go to the ticket booth (where I was directed) and wait 20 minutes in that line to get to the front to then be told I need to enter another line for tickets? Another 10 minute wait and I finally have someone see my name for tickets. But there are printing problems? Why wasn't this done beforehand? 

Once we find our seats the game was pretty (bad). But great seats and courteous fans. (Atlanta can learn from these folks). The Center is okay for it's size and quality. I got great drinks and food from the main floor. Of course overpriced but that was to be expected. Comparing this to Atlanta - there is a lot in need to be upgraded. But the location, parking, and amenities make it "Just Okay". I wish the Suns would just play better ball.I was here recently for the Rattlers Arena Bowl game.  Kinda cool to see football in a basketball arena.  Lines were a little too long for the concession stands.Came here for a Sade concert and I wasn't particularly impressed. They need to illuminate the row numbers when the lights are lowered I couldn't see a damn thing when trying to find my seat. Also the leg room is nonexistent seeing that I have a bad knee that doesn't do well when bent for more than 20 min it was rather uncomfortable. I had to wait until the person in front of me got up so I could extend my leg. I'd be hesitant to see another concert here, but I could tell it's probably a decent area for a sporting event. Everything else about this place seemed fairly decent. I didn't visit the concession stand but I'm sure it's ridiculously high priced as all the others.This arena MIGHT be reviewed higher if Sir Charles was still playing, but I digress. 

My friend Cynthia and I caught the Clippers vs Suns game over the weekend.   US Airways Center seemed smaller compared to Staples Center.   The ushers I encountered were nice throughout the evening.

I have TWO bones to pick with this arena:
First - the beer guys walking throughout the arena did not have a sign as to how much their product was.  That's just bad business in my opinion.
Two - Your "security" needs to learn how to count.  I get you have to tell people THREE times before you eject someone from their seat, but I was only TWICE.

(Disclaimer:  #2 may or may not have happened to me during my visit)Last night, I attended my first Suns game since moving to Phoenix in late November, so this was my first visit to US Airways Center. 

It's definitely a smaller arena but it's clean and the staff is very friendly. Concession prices were around the national average ($5 for a pretzel, $8 for a Grey Goose + pineapple). I sat in sec 108, row 22 and thought I had a very good view of the game. Again, it's a smaller arena so I can't imagine there are really any bad seats. 

Considering the arena was only around 2/3 full, the crowd was still loud and "into" the game (as in, people were there for the basketball, not to people watch or "to be seen"). 

It's a nice arena, don't get me wrong; it's just nothing special. Parking was DEFINITELY overpriced and it would have been nice if there were handicapped parking spots near the elevator (my mom's disabled and I didn't like that she had to walk across half the parking garage just to get to the elevator). 

Sidenote: My review might have been affected by the game itself, which was also nothing special (I'm a hockey fan so it's hard for me to get excited about a regular season basketball game featuring two teams near the bottom of the Western Conference).The seats are ridiculous. I am 6'0"and my boyfriend is 6'3" and we barely fit.  This place needs to be redone for tall people.  It's not like humans are getting shorter?Let me start by saying what an awesome concept this is! Sit at a restaurant table overlooking a ball game?! Yes please! 
When you book a table and tickets here you must meet a food and drink minimum, which wasn't an issue. Somewhat because we eat and drink a lot and somewhat because they have incredibly inflated prices. I guess this is par for a ballpark, though, so I will let this slide.
The menu was limited and had zero vegetarian entrees. So I got a chicken salad sans chicken and potato skins sans bacon. No price reduction for doing so.
They had a decent variety of liquor, wine and beer available. The food was "okay". Nothing that makes it memorable by any means. Service was nice (be forewarned your tip IS included and they will not tell you this). I don't enjoy that. *If the server actually tells me this, I always tip them extra for honesty. 
We had a nice evening and enjoyed ourselves! We would do this again for sure, however mainly for the experience. Not the food or service. 
(FYI tables only seat 4 or 6).I have been here twice and caught the game both times.  We sat out on the balcony.  The beauty of it is that 50% of the ticket price comes back in food credit.  The catch is you have to purchase the table.  We bought 4 tickets for $300 total and got $150 in food.  Let me tell you that is quite a bit of food.  The game day menu is not the full menu but you can still get burgers, steak, ribs, and chicken.  The food prices are comparable to any other TGIF but the cocktails are pretty over priced.  $10 for a 16 oz plastic glass of something.  My wife had a frozen margarita and it tasted funny.  

My steak was decent.  I wanted medium rare and it was cooked more than that.  The service was really slow.  I get the fact that the servers are moving up and down stairs trying to get everyone their stuff.  It was quite a bit of time between refills and the food did not all come out at once.  Actually we had to remind whomever it was that brought out the food several times of things that were missing.  Our actually waitress did not bring us much of our requests.  It was my wife's birthday and this was what she wanted to do.   Personally I prefer to sit out in the crowd in the bleachers and whoop and holler.  

The one really cool thing about it all was that we paid $300 for 4 tickets but after looking at the website again it clearly stated that the table was $260 for the 4 tickets.  After a couple of e-mails back and forth to the manager they offered $40 food credit or offered to credit the $40 back to my card.  They said it would have to be on the night of the event because the computer wouldn't allow them to do it.  The manager walked up to me and gave me $40 cash to make up for the difference.  That was really cool.  

Overall if it is something you have never done then it is worth checking out.  The be served throughout the game is cool.  The service could stand to be quicker, more accurate, and better organized.  I would do it again but it is not the seats of personal choice.I really wan to like this place more because it gets some of the best acts in town, but it is cramped, stuffy, the stage is too low, the sound quality is not great and they do not serve alcohol so the crowd is kind of stiff and non-fun.  I will keep going because as previously stated, they get some of the best acts in town, but... let's hope they work on the format.We were forced to come here since we had an estimated two hour wait for Pizzeria Bianco located next door.

They have a selection of wine & beer. I loved the moscato but it was $10 for a glass. Beer selections are much more affordable. 

The ambience is really cute and wasn't crowded.

We ordred 1 appetizer which was the crostini. It was SOO small for $6. Two pieces of bread & four olives. Definitely not share-worthy.

This is a good place to go with long-lost friends since you'll be waiting at least 1 hour if not more for pizza next door.Affordable and good.  Clean restaurant.  Will return.I got free entrance to the center for a conference I was attending, and as a college student, it was a nice evening.  Maybe I'm spoiled growing up on the east coast, but this museum was so small.  The attractions the museum did have were cool and definitely elementary school aged kid friendly.  It just wasn't anything out of the ordinary.I've been to Rositas about four times and overall my experience has been okay.
The inside has beautiful mexican touches that makes you feel like your right at home at your abuelas house.
They even have a little fish pond inside the restaurant which is pretty.
I recently went to Rositas on Father's Day and the experience was different than before. When we got there we were automatically seated and the place wasn't full which I was kind of happy about because every other place we went to had crazy wait lines but then again it was Father's Day so we kind of have to accept that. 
Anyways, we get seated and were given our menus and they gave us chips and green and red salsa. The chips seem to be homemade but they are greasy. I could feel the grease inside my mouth which wasn't a great taste.
While were waiting for someone to take our order another family that came in about 10 min after us, they had got there orders taken way before we have. So we ask a worker when someone was going to take our order and she notified a waitress. 
Our food comes out and they are very generous on there food. The pictures that
are displayed here are very accurate. One thing is that they put wayyyyy to much cheese. I ordered a chile relleno and I thought it being a mexican restuarant it would be white cheese but they use american cheese and the tasting was okay. My dad ordered pork meat or something like that and the meat was dry. He said it tasted like they made it and then re-headed it. He didn't finish it and my dad loves his meat which I was so surprised.
Now let's get to the best part. My mom ordered I believe the combination which came with an enchilada, taco, rice or beans, and another item which i can't recall. While eating her enchilada she found a hair. We told the waiter and she took it back and then she comes out and says "we took a look at it and it wasn't hair it was plastic."
Like if saying it was plastic was suppose to make it better or something. She then got it replaced with there mexican hot wings. I do have to say that it is pretty expensive and it's not really worth the money. It's an Okay place but I wouldn't say it the best mexican food. It's not authentic and it seems like an americanized mexican restaurant.It's a taqueria in a Latino supermarket.  Nothing special but you have choices. 

They will have just about everything you may like. It's not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want.

I'd go back if I just needed something quick....I only ever do this place for take out when I'm in the area, or if I'm looking for something special like congee. If you have not had congee yet, do it. It's awesome rice porridge. (Don't do the thousand-year-old egg though, it is interesting, but not nearly as awesome.) 

I had my hopes high after hearing so many good things from long term Phoenicians in the valley that love, love, love this place. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Or just kinda settled. 

And you know what, it's okay to settle some nights of the week. 

Not every night can be a mighty! flavor! explosion! If that was the case then Pei Wei and Panda Express would have gone out of business years ago. Fuck it. I'm giving an extra star out just for not being a tepid commercialized variation of salty brown sauce plus rice. In yo' face, Pan-Asian corporate "cuisine." 

The prices are right, the food is piping hot, and the menu is extensive. A perfectly adequate option for Chinese take-out.I have been here 3 times. 2 times to eat and once I forgot cash. The first time was not great the fryer was down and the fry's sucked. 

The 2nd time was a little better. Except the food inspector was there. Normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything. 

We ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke. One burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both. I was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one. (I should have though, I do not care for onions on the burger) The fry's were good, in fact I could have eaten another order. 

The cook Andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke, ketchup, other peoples meals, the "regular" got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure Andy knew it was 2 singles...

The other "regular" looked as if she rolled out of bed, smoked a J, slapped her over sized headphones and Ipod in her PJ pocket and rode her bike here. She totally dumped her bike in the front, like she owned the place. Andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head didn't get it. 

Andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there, not sure what but he was outside for a while. 

 I like Welcome but with 2 issues in 2 visits I dunno If I will be back.This is a ghetto place, no offense.  The girls are happy, customers are happy, but put your game face on when you walk in.  The place is a money machine for the owner, low overhead, positive cash flow.  

Why is this place called bandaids show lounge?  Because its small, the dancers wear less than bikinis, and/or the building is long and skinny like a bandaid.  There are three stages, really just two 2x2 raised areas, and a bigger main stage. This place could be a set for a movie scene requiring a ghetto strip club.  Dont get me wrong, its colorful, lots of character.  When it comes to strip clubs, the main thing is the talent.  This place has a lot of local talent.  And one or two top tier girls, either by virtue of body, youth, personality, or some combination.  Saturday this place was crowded up until 2am, of course, it only takes a few people in a small place, but still.  Top girl - in my opinion, phoenix.  21 (stated age) and hot.  She could be 16, 17, 18.  Thin body, white.I was so excited to visit Ranch Market, as I never have before. I have been to Food City near my house, which I love, but I heard Ranch Market was like a Food City on steroids.

I was disappointed by a few things...

First the good. It's huge and has every Mexican delicacy you can think of. Awesome bakery, tortilleria, hot foods, huge cheese section, random pig body parts in the cheese section. 

My tummy was growling so I decided to get a bean burrito before I shopped. The people working there were quite disorganized. There were 2 people ahead of me. I person ordered a cup of green chili and the other person ordered a side of rice. Between 3 employees it took 5 minutes to get our three orders out. After getting my burrito, I turn around and my cart with a couple items in it was gone! I seriously turned my back just for 30 seconds. It was obvious it was mine... hmmmm.

Luckily the burrito was delicious. Do not underestimate the power of a good, simple bean burrito. The tortilla was puffy, the beans creamy, the cheese gooey. Yum.

I go get myself another cart and by the time I get to the produce section I realize the handle of my cart is quite sticky. Yuck. Thank God for hand sanitizer in my purse.

Yes, the produce section is huge and has great variety. I saw some childhood favorites there... nopales, jicama, etc. The sale prices on produce were very good. However, the quality of some items were bad. The tomatoes were on sale, but they weren't even ripe. They were pale pink. I didn't even bother. The lemons were mushy and infested with flies. 

The condition of the store in general was run down and dirty. A cooler holding frozen fruit was filthy. The lack of sanitation made me a bit nervous.

Also making me nervous were the many unsupervised children running amok, pulling things off shelves and just creating chaos. I almost accidentally hit a few with my cart. 

Still, I came out of Ranch Market with lots of produce, lots of pork for carnitas, fresh cheeses, fresh tortillas all for under $30. With a delicious bean burrito in my belly. Yep, I call it a good night.I'd have to say this was average for most divey little Mexican places.  Being so close to the freeway you are likely to pass right by without a second thought.  You can't judge a book by its cover because while the outside says Ugh, the inside of the place is done up very well with thick lacquered wood chairs straight out of a Mexican church.

I was super excited because everyone raved on the salsa, which I have to say was quite a disappointment.  The green was definitely spicy but had absolutely no flavor to it whatsoever, I think I could have accomplished the same thing by mixing cayenne with a corn starch slurry.  The red had a little heat but the overpowering flavor was oregano, not my favorite herb for salsa, where's the cilantro?!?

The cheese enchilada with rice and beans I ordered is what saved the place.  It was a decent portion of food and tasted great.  A co-worker had the carne asada and I don't think the steak was even marinated and was griddle grilled so it didn't have any char flavor either, it was saved by the guacamole whihc wasn't anything to rave about either.

If you work downtown and are looking for somewhere new, close, and inexpensive for Mexican food, it's definitely a place to try at least once to gauge against others.I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.  Lucky me, I found Coronado Cafe.
We stopped in for lunch so I did not order as much food as I normally like to when trying out a new restaurant ( it was a work day ).  Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise.
We went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right amount of heat.  The potato salad was very tasty satisfying side.
It was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a server/bartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August.Hard to give correct stars.  We were a large group in the back room.  Cute little place.  Great service.  Mixed food experiences.  7 meals were good, two were very disappointing and I would not recommend them at all.  The crab eggs Benedict was awful.  Eggs hard,  hollandaise sauce had no flavor and tasted of flour!  Plus it was not very warm.  Would normally send back to kitchen, but were there right up against closing.  I don't think I'll be going back or recommend it.  If I were closer by, I might give it another try.It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said "Best lunch in town!" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself "Yes, i think I will". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again.Overpriced,

Other than that the place is fun and the service is friendly. The food was ok, nothing special. The soda & ice cream were good, but again overpriced. I can't see myself ever coming back.Visited the Mesa location. Dr Nguyen was great but his staff not so much. The nurse had to mention to my son that his sister was his half sister. That did not have to be stated at all! That's irrelevant. Now I have to explain to an 8 year old how and why his sister is a half sister. That is really unacceptable!!!The WiFi in the guestrooms is terribly slow, but rooms are comfortable. The hotel is located in a decent location.Really wanted to love love love this place. The service was great and liked the decor. The food wasn't amazing though. I got the garlic shrimp, which seemed more buttery than garlicky. Husband muscled through his fish tacos. Kiddos didn't want to eat what looked like Costco chicken nuggets.

I did like my giant margarita. The amuse-bouche (ceviche) was phenomenal.This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I can't, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2.

Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.

Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.  

If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way.Do you feel like finding out what it's like to die a slow and horrible death in the middle of the desert? If your answer is yes, then you should come here around noon or early afternoon in the summer and you'll know exactly how it feels like.

Okay, so when I visited today, it's not even summer, and I took most of the precautions that were given on their website - I went to walmart and bought sunscreen, a hat, and a giant bottle of water. Was it enough? NO. I suggest that if you plan on going on a hot and sunny day, bring or rent an umbrella (they rent it out for $2) or go really early in the morning (or later at night) so you don't feel like you're getting burned to death. 

$18 for adult, $10 for student, $15 for seniors and it comes with a FREE AUDIO Guide. Now I didn't take one because I couldnt stand in one spot for more than a second, but it will make the trip more enjoyable, as looking at billions of cacti and not knowing that the differences are between them can get boring.

Their Gift Shop is closed until November. There are a couple of trails in there and they add up to approximate 1.5 miles. Depending on how much you love cactus and flowers, you could spend between 3 minutes to 3 hours in there. 

Let me say this one more time:
- wear lots of sunscreen
- wear sunglasses
- wear a hat
- bring water - preferably frozen ahead of time
- bring an umbrella, or rent one

If you set aside the fact that it's deathly hot in there, the place is very serene and enjoyable.Go if you don't live in the desert. 

If you do, or have, skip it. $18 a person ....not really worth that many dollars.  You can go to the desert or look at your own front yard.All I could remember was ... heat.  We went on a mid 70 day and it was still exhausting to walk in the heat.  There are a few really tall cactus' that are cool but honestly..... I wouldn't go back nor would I bring anyone visiting.  I can't seem to find entertainment in plants ! Don't take my opinion on it and go at least once.  The glassblowing exhibit made it a bit more enjoyable.  We stopped by this food area that had really good garlic fries... being foodies we even tried to food.  There were a lot of quails .. we spotted a cardinal which was pretty cool.  Other than that.. a few tips buy online to skip the line, bring water, use your student ID.The Good:
-awesome complimentary breakfasts
-warm gooie chocolate chip cookie at check in
-nice pool and and hot tub at the center
-fairly large room with 2 tvs (flat screen) and a huge comfortable bed with down pillows

The Bad:
- not a bad fitness room but could be larger
-It doesn't have the feel/look of a fancy hotel at first ...more like a motel (but the rooms are nice and the restaurant too) 

The Ugly:
-no free internetI'm from the SF Bay area and I get pupusa from Zocalos and La Bamba. While the pupusas here were pretty good I can't say the same for some of the plates. I ordered the bistec something and it was drenched in some sort of gravy. While the meat was tender, it was abit salty for my taste. The cabbage salad they gave was great but the accompanying salsa was very bland. 

While I might come back here just for some pupusas. 

The drink we had was pretty good. And yes it was a fluorescent yellow.Friendly service and cheap, cheap, cheap prices!  My husband and I had 5 pupusas between the two of us, horchata, and an ensalada drink for a grand total of $16, including tip.  While I thought the pupusas were fine, though much cheesier than the ones I'm used to (from La Santaneca in SF), my husband proclaimed, "They were bland!"  I guess we will be continuing our search for comparable pupusas, though if I go by his standards, there are no other places that compare to his favorite restaurant in the city.My husband is the fan of Indian food, and I had a gift certificate from some students, so we gave Indian Delhi Palace a try.  The service was spotty, depending on who was in our section at the time.  The naan and puri were excellent, and both of our entrees were tasty (my husband had the chicken tikka masala and I had a mild lamb dish in cream sauce. The jasmine rice was beautiful and well cooked, but also had cardamom seeds in it (not my favorite). My husband loved his palak paneer. We agreed that overall, we have had a little better food and service from Taste of India.I love Indian food. This place is yummy. I had the chicken masala :). The staff was super nice and happy. One thing that I love as much as good food is good service! ;)This place was disappointing on different levels. First, the food was okay but not great. I thought the naan was below average and tasted more like flatbread than what naan is supposed to taste like. My dish was the chicken tikka masala and it just lacked flavor and any hint of spiciness. I did get the mango shake and it was truly excellent!

The waiter seemed quite inpatient throughout the night. On a couple instances he assumed what we meant instead of getting clarification; thus, bringing out the wrong thing. Then the restaurant turned off the music 10 minutes before closing and basically tried to rush us out. Seriously??? Not a way to keep business coming back! I mean, chill out... most of us were pretty much finishing up at that point so at least give the diners the courtesy of a full experience.

Too many better options to want to come back here...Had the Sunday buffet which had quite a spread much of which tasted just fine. Three different types of desserts. The samosas were not kept warm which was a bummer. I also should not have to ask to have my water filled or wait some time for plates to be cleared. Service was not as attentive as I would like but the food was pretty good.This is a decent airport hotel.  The only problem is a very limited selection of restaurants nearby and within walking distance. 

Standard Hampton room with comfortable bedding, large flat screen tv, and free wi-fi if you have status with them.  The wi-fi is dog slow though.  I tethered to my phone and this area is 4G so great speed doing that vs. using the wireless at the hotel.

No afternoon receptions at this Hampton and standard fare in the morning for breakfast.

Employees are polite but slow.  Check in takes forever.  And if you're a Diamond, chances are they'll forget to give you your "treat & drink".

Average.I've been going to this Red Devil since I was a kid. I remember my Dad used to know one of the guys who made the pizzas in the front of the restaurant. Anyway, I went by Red Devil last night to pick up a pizza after getting out of continuing ed at 8:00. I had ordered a half cheese half Mediterranean pizza (spinach, ricotta, garlic, tomato). The pizza was 16$...a little pricey, but not for a specialty pizza. I brought the pizza home and unfortunately it was on the cold side (always a hazard when picking up a pizza) and they didn't include any crushed red pepper in the box (I guess I should have asked). Anyway, the pizza was good, but it was a bit too garlicky....and from me, that is a statement (I'm a huge garlic lover). The garlic stayed in my mouth after brushing my teeth so strongly it was hard to fall asleep....kind of a funny thing. Anyway, I will probably return here, but it isn't at the top of my list for pizza.I was smart enough to know that the rent here should never be more than 800 for a two bedroom. Rent accordingly to the market! My two bedroom two bath 1200 square feet apartment, i got for only 695$ a month. But I can understand why some people would be angry with the rent they paid and what they are getting. 

This review will be based on my experiences of living here since January of 2011. 

The Good
1. Our neighbors are all very decent and not once have I ever had problems with noise complaints, sketchy neighbors etc. We all look out for each other and even get to know each other's dogs!  (although there are some assholes living here, it's not bad, people are really friendly. 
2. the maintenance guys will definitely come fix your stuff asap. Assuming they get the work order...sometimes my work orders would only say one thing when there would be multiple things needed to be fixed... this would be the front office's fault. They are all very helpful, nice, and gentlemen. They live in the neighboorhood, have families and pets there too so they understand what you're going through.
3. Rent can now be paid online, so there is no hassle to having to deposit a check or coming into the office, etc. The rent billed each month will now include water and sewage based on the usage and number of units total. You can pick which electricity you have. If you choose aps you're on one side, if you choose srp, you're on the other. The electricity for my apartment was about 65 a month regularly and up to 160 for summer. I'm on a peak hour plan with aps and USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY! 
4. Grounds keeping and dog poop is not a problem and they don't mow the grass early either! 
5. Close and convenient to shopping places such as Costco, target, fry's, safeway, walmart. Close to freeway access. You are near the 202 and 143. 
6. The apartment itself is quite spacious, open, and fairly new. Don't expect modern appliances that are stainless steel, but you can expect VERY high ceilings, nice finishes, and new carpet. I loved the layout and the space. I also loved the masterbath. That tub was amazing for bubble baths!!
7. Each unit has it's own laundry! YES YES YES!!!!!

The Bad...mostly annoying
1. One covered parking spot for a two bedroom with multiple residents sucks. uncovered isn't bad, it's just far from where you need to be. Be careful though, if you park illegally or stupidly i.e. in two lanes, you will be towed. they have their own towing companies to come in. I even got a citation warning for having a out of state license plate when I am an out of state student! 
2.There is only ONE dumpster for each complex. This means if you have trash and you live on the opposite side of the complex, you drive your trash. I mean it, many of us have to drive multiple trash to the dumpster. 
3. The previous reviews are right about the gate. The gate was left open a lot at night and  sometimes it would go for two three days without being fixed. What's the point of a gate code when all you have to do is wait for someone to go in. 
4. I lived on the first floor so the air quality was kinda terrible. It was stuffy and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get it to be cool and airy. 
5. I hated the sink. It's a double sink, but it's not deep. So dishes pile up fast. 

The Ugly
1. DON'T LET THE COP CAR PARKED OUT FRONT FOOL YOU! It's a terrible bad bad bad neighborhood; multiple people have had break ins. HIDE YO KIDS, HIDE YO WIFE.  LOCK YOUR DOORS AND BAR YOUR WINDOWS! DO NOT LIVE ON THE FIRST FLOOR! I even got a friggin rearview mirror stolen from my car parked in broad daylight in a covered parking spot! Learned my lesson, now I have a knife, bat, and pepper spray at hand to protect me! 

Overall Impression
This place wasn't a bad apartment. For the square footage and the price I paid, I loved it. If this apartment was located elsewhere it would have been a dream! There are things you have to weigh, if you think you can overlook them then this place will be perfect! I unfortunately can't.We went to the zoo this past Saturday because the weather was mild and beautiful and it seemed like a nice Memorial weekend activity. Apparently, a lot of other people had the same idea, because it was totally packed! Our favorite thing about the zoo was the way many of the habitats - most notably, that of the longhorns - was built into/around the natural desert landscape. Papago Peak was a gorgeous backdrop for the wildlife. One other really stand-out exhibit was the monkey habitat. There is a winding path through a bunch of trees, and the monkeys jump through the trees and even cross the path every so often. Less enchanting were the tiger and lion exhibits; the habitats were run-down, and the animals seemed lonely and restless. I have definitely been to better zoos, but this was a fun way to spend an afternoon on an unseasonably mild Phoenix afternoon.Perhaps the timing wasn't so good...those animals looked pretty exhausted to me.  A tingle of animal cruelty red flags ran down my spine while cruising this place in about 110 degrees of hotness.  Most of them were asleep in whatever sliver of shade they managed to squeeze under while the ones who had any type of pond/water...were in/near the water.  Definitely not as cool as the San Diego Zoo, which pretty much set the bar for my standards of a decent zoo.

+ Wealth of ice cream & frozen lemonades for the tourists
- Animals could use some air conditioning...I enjoyed my one and only visit to this zoo during the evening christmas lights event they have every year. some animals were still out and the light show is a great family event.While I am a fan of the zoo, I'm not a fan of how expensive it has gotten! It is now $20/adult and $10/child from 3-12 years old. This does NOT include the stingray exhibit, carousel, or safari train which are extra. There is a "premium" admission which is $23/adult and $13/child which isn't advertised on the website but does include the stingrays, carousel, or safari train. Even with the premium pricing, the camel ride, giraffe encounter, are all additional charges. The food is way over priced. 

That having been said, the zoo itself is beautiful. It's very clean with friendly staff and nice, broad based exhibits. The petting zoo is very nicely done and it's always a good visit. Just be prepared to spend a pretty penny on a visit to the Phoenix Zoo. 

So as much as I'd like to give it more stars, the Phoenix Zoo is pricing itself out of the market with the nickel diming that it's doing to its guests.This review is based on past experiences which were about 2 stars, and today which was a 3-4ish. The last time I went to this zoo I was NOT happy. But I figured, hey let's try again...

First off, do not go to this place without a coupon. I had a free kid coupon from the savvy shopper which put admission for my daughter and me @ $20. Not bad. 
Get there early. Parking is a nightmare around lunchtime. Avoid photo vultures at entrance upon arrival. 

We walked in and decided to hop on the safari train for an extra $5 each. For the size of this zoo, that was the best idea EVER. We went clear around the African trail and surprisingly saw most animals and decent views as well. I have walked that trail before and seen NOTHING so I was happy with that. 

After that we hopped off the train and walked to the exhibits you miss from the train. Orangutans must have all been sleeping. Boo. That's usually the best part. Bears were out, which is usually not the case. Little monkey exhibit is VERY cool, only problem is the little kids who run around and scare the monkeys back into the trees. Seriously I could not believe some of these kids in this place were allowed to act the way they did. 

I didn't buy any concession items. Brought my own snacks and water. They looked pricey though. 

I think the cooler temps had a lot to do with the animals being out. It was around 65 or 70. 

I'll go back next fall. With a coupon, of course.Went to the Phoenix Zoo a couple of days ago and had a good time. I hadn't been in about two years (except for Zoo Lights which is different) and a few things have been added. My fiance and I got a $2 off discount each for AAA membership which was nice. They do let you bring your own water which is great because it is $3.79 a bottle at the concession stands, ouch! We started at the Arizona Trail area which has animals from around Arizona. While this is a cool exhibit for learning about Arizona natural history, it does not wow me in the long run.

The zoo is well maintained and clean for the most part which is good. I did take off one star because the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting! I understand that this is a zoo but the utter stench coming out of the bathrooms is enough to scare a wild animal away! Bathrooms = Bad! 

The majority of the animals were napping on our visit which is understandable but a little disappointing when you want to see them in action. It was really cool to see the white rhino. We caught the tail end of a tour passing through and learned that she is 43 years old and most rhino's in captivity only live to be 35 at most, so she is really beating the odds! The lions were taking a cat nap but the male lion was rolling around every once in awhile. We also learned from the tour that the female lion, Cookie, had recently had surgery and while she was recovering for two days, the male lion waited outside the door and paced the entire time she was gone. Awww... We made our way around to the spider monkey house which was pretty cool. You get to go in the cage with them and see them run and play around you. We also learned that all of the spider monkey's (13 of them) are named after Star Trek characters which I found awesome, being the nerd that I am. The orangutan exhibit is also really cool. It is pretty big and has a lot of space for them to socialize and run around. One of the orangutan's had a dixie cup with some liquid in it when we came around the corner and another one was trying to steal it from him. It was quite entertaining. It is nice that the keeper's provide them with enrichment activities.

Overall this is a pretty good zoo. I would recommend bringing kids here or even if you just want to have a good day trip outside while it is still nice and not an inferno.  Return factor: 70%This place is okay for the right price.  I stay here on a corp rate between $150 - $190 a night depending on the season/time of year.  It's got a good club lounge with solid options.  The location is a bit strange because it really is in the middle of no where and all around you are chain restaurants heading north.  But the rooms are pretty big and beds are comfy.  I do have to admit that anything over the corp rate would be stretching it.If you just need a full service hotel to sleep in, this one works. I normally do not have a car while staying here, so I have a choice of eating in their terrible restaurant or taking a 20 minute cab ride out and back. The fitness room is nice, stocked with fresh fruit and water. The pool is big enough to swim laps (maybe 25 m??), but too warm in the summer. The concierge room is well kept. One of the most sterile marriotts I've ever stayed in as well as serving some of the worst coffee.Marriott's beds are always the most comfortable out of all the hotels I've stayed. I would not recommend Marriott Phoenix Airport for an extended (more than a week) stay, though. All in all, the hotel is nice, and the staff is probably the friendliest I have dealt with in a long time. 

There is no free WiFi, and you'd think that a chain like Marriott would provide it for free. There are no refrigerators or microwave ovens in the rooms, either.It is May people! To have a swimming pool in Phoenix Arizona look as dilapidated as this is unacceptable. I went out to the pool for 5 minutes and turned right back around. 
The room is like any other Marriott room, awesome bed and pillows, as usual. Room service food was very good and prompt.Its a Marriott. I am a fan of the brand and liked this location because its by the airport. Great people and good service. Rooms were clean and so was the hotel. Easy in and out. Give them a try. I think you will like it. I had an early flight so it was good for me.Good dive bar,

Serve good drinks.... Yes, even mixed drinks.

Pool tables are decent.

There is a wide variety of bartenders.

I will be back.... Maybe in a few months.this place was cool. the exhibits were great the kids play area was awesome. we just wish the people greeting us and selling us our tickets were nice. they were down right rude. they seemed annoyed with us  before we even finished paying. maybe because we redeemed a groupon? not sure but it really made of upset. the kids had fun and we enjoyed all the old vintage fire truckOverall, the museum itself is great and my 3 year old loves it but the woman working there is always RUDE and the toys in the kids area are FILTHY. The place is usually pretty empty other than a few toddler/preschool age kids and maybe one or two adults roaming around. I definitely think the kids are keeping this place open so maybe they should take that into consideration at the front desk and when it comes to cleanliness. (Seriously, it's disgusting. I'm worried we're going to come home with hepatitis one of these days.)While I'm no expert on Chinese culture, I do enjoy the cuisine. The Cofco Center is an interesting place to visit, and there is no shortage of new dishes to try at the various restaurants. The Lao Ching Hing restaurant was very good, and not difficult to get in and out of during a lunch hour. 

The Asian Seafood Buffet used to be one of the places my coworkers and I would go when we were really short on time. The food was all right, and there was a decent sushi bar in the middle. However, during our last visit we came back to our table and found a roach waiting for us. Inexpensive or not, cleanliness is a big deal.Most of the place is closed right now. I was told it was remodeling but I am not sure.  What is there is good but there is not much to see right now at the cultural center.Pretty sure this is the dive-iest dive I've ever been to.

They have bar shuffleboard (LOVE IT), are sort of lenient about checking IDs (as in they don't?), and always have groups of rowdy drunkies ready to start fights and talk shit, which always proves to be an interesting time.

My 3-star rating is not indicative of a classy, safe place, but rather one that after leaving, we always have a good story for the next day at work starting with "Holy shit man, you'll never guess what happened last night at Baja's...."It's a dive bar.  They have lots of TVs to watch sports.  They have a few pool tables.  The grill and fryer are in the bar area so the cook and bartender kind of share the space back there.   I was there on a weekday late at night and I would say that 80% of the customers were Hispanic and every customer except me had visible tattoos.  However this didn't bother me at all as I knew it was a dive bar before I came there.  Nobody caused any problems when I was there.   I also noticed a bunch of baseball memorabilia around the place and signs advertising for weekly appearances by various historical baseball players who presumably sell autographs and other personalized merchandise.

The drinks were cheap and the service was fast and friendly.Was grocery shopping for dinner and somehow ended up here instead...
Our host was very nice and sat us immediately after walking in, he also informed us on drink specials. It is a bit loud here but not as loud as the camelback/central location :) 
I was thinking of ordering a drink but opted for water instead just because.
We decided on the 2-4-24 and chose boneless wings as our appetizer. I think Applebee's wing's are just OK compared to other places, the sauce just doesn't do it for me but I'll eat them 
For my entree I decided on the double crunch shrimp with fries 
Wow, they give you at least 18 pieces of shrimp and I am like trying to eat... Unless they're trying to say something haha 
I'm taking some home
The shrimp is good itself with the sauce on the sideIt's like Denny's but Mexican.

Food is salty, which makes it good.

Chips are ok

Margarita's were great

Atmosphere reminded me of a bad Miami Vice episode shot in Mexico.  

Not a bad experience, but definitely better choices out there.When I first moved to Phoenix I was so excited for great Mexican food, coming from New England, that shouldn't be too tall of an order. My initial search for "Best Mexican Food in Phoenix" actually brought back Macayo's (this was long before the days of Yelp). I tried Macayo's a few times and it was ok, then I moved on to greener pastures.

Fast forward 5 years, many mexican restaurants, and a major diet change and I am at Chase field enjoying a veggie burrito, beans, and rice all courtesy of Macayo's. I actually craved it the next day so finally we decided to head to the original location and give it a whirl.

The building is quite ugly but I liked that it at least seemed to have some character. The inside leaves some to be desired, the atmosphere just blows. I don't care if a place is kitschy or mildly tacky but the whole dining setup just feels awkward. The cantina actually looked a bit more lively but we still opted for the dining area. 

The waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else, can't complain there. Come to find out they don't have the veggie burrito that I enjoyed so much at Chase Field! WTF?! The salsa here is good but the chips are kind of bland. The meal was decent but I kept wondering why I can't have what I had from the menu at Chase? My girlfriend's side of rice also tasted funky, again the Chase rice was much better - what is going on here?!

The best part of my meal was actually the house margarita. It was slightly sweet but had enough tequila in it and went down nicely.

I hate to say this but Chase Field food is actually better then this place, the sad and ironic part is it's the same restaurant!Went here for Cinco De Mayo for a a margarita. They were pretty good and not over priced. Very cool looking building! Service was pleasant but overall the restaurant wasn't overly impressive but I would still go back agian!Meat and chicken is high a quality-customer service gets three stars though-unfriendly staff at times-with high prices they charge excellent customer service should be an expectation.As an old Pizzeria Bianco customer from way back , I admittedly dragged some pretty high expectations in with me to Pane Bianco; maybe something along the lines of the deli sandwiches Duck N Decanter made to order for so many years near 16th and Camelback, or maybe even something a little better.  

Wow. Was I disappointed.   

My $8 tuna sandwich, straight off the menu, was supposed to come with fancy olives and red onion and came with neither - just tuna and copious arugula on spongy flatbread.  I was surprised, considering they make the same three or four items over and over, and disappointed, since I was craving a richly texured, crunchy construction. The tuna tasted fine - I think they put some lemon in it and maybe there's an olive or two pulverized beyond recognition into the paste - but it's no better than when I open a can of albacore at home and add a little horseradish or curry or what have you and slap some water chestnuts on top - or when I go to Subway and pile black olives, tomato and cheese on a larger, cheaper sub ( on admittedly inferior bread).  The bread here was round and chewy, spongy, but not crunchy at all - reminded me of the bread at Schlotsky's - the whole thing was just kind of flat.  

My son had the salami and provelone and said it was "good". Not great or amazing. Just "good".  We spent $21.62 on two smallish sandwiches and creme sodas to go. No sides. Meh.  

The girls in front were friendly and efficient and the food came out incredibly fast - so quick I wondered if (dare I say it?) my sandwich was PRE-MADE. Mine tasted like it could have been. I dont know if the bread was intended to be warm or not, but after a 10 min drive home, it wasnt.  They use nice heavy paper to wrap up the food and a cute paper "to-go" bag with a handle. 

The waiting area is small and there's one (1) metal folding chair for people to sit on. I guess the idea is to walk around and peruse the tiny $16 bottles of imported capers instead, and since it's 110 outside I really wouldnt expect more air conditioned seating from the guy who makes folks wait hours for pizza across town instead of simply taking reservations. 

Someday, I'll come back to try the mozzarella and tomato cuz I still remember how good his cheese tasted a decade earlier, and Chris B's track record has certainly earned him a second chance, but I wont be burning my gas or wallet on return trips this hot summer, based on today's experience.I have to concur with Shannon and Sarah on this one. 

In high school, we used to get out n Friday's at 12:30 and then we would rendezvous with our lady friends for lunch. There were an amazingly high number of awkward teenage lunches that took place at this Duck and Decanter, until one day I realized that I really don't like the food there, or anything about it really. 

It somewhat effectively passes itself off as a gourmet sandwicheria/deli but more by pricing everything high than serving good sandwiches. 

I'll still drop by from time to time and still have friends from high school that love it, I just don't think I ever will. 

Two and a half stars.The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.My boyfriend and I ate here yesterday after attending church for some friends.  We typically have only gone to the location in Scottsdale on Thunderbird but since we were in Central Phoenix we decided to try this location.  Food was decent but service was pretty bad.  I asked for pancakes with my meal, waitress brought potatoes.  Coffee was lukewarm at best.  We had to ask for a pitcher of water.  My boyfriend asked for a to go cup for his soda but she brought him a to go box instead.  It seemed as if she was ready to leave as it was towards the end of their day.  I think we'll stay with our normal location as they seem to have the service down to a fine art.What can I say, this is a Walgreens. They are conveniently open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a 2 lane drive-thru pharmacy. I primarily come to this Walgreens to pick up my prescription and my experience is always hit-or-miss. The pharmacy can be EXTREMELY SLOWWWW. Especially if you come here at night since they are located near the hospitals so there is usually a small line of people filling prescriptions. 
I had one experience probably 6 months ago where I decided to go inside the store one night so I could pick up a soda or something with my prescription. There were maybe 3 or 4 people in line in front of me. I waited in line for over half an hour. During this time, any car that went through the drive thru was being served more promptly than the people standing there in line. When I finally got to the counter, the staff member was very apologetic that I had to wait so long, although I know it was not her fault, they were just severely understaffed. 
I do have to say though, that in recent months, they have been more efficient with their operations whenever I have come through here.Comfort food... Basic down-home dinner. :-) sometimes ya just gotta.Wow, so this is the mecca of Chinese food in Phoenix? I mean don't get me wrong, I had some enjoyable items, but this is the Macayo's of Chinese restaurants. Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price. Now, mind you there is a hell-a-handsome tattooed waiter, who while I'm waiting for my to go food, I do the blue steel, eye lash flicker while I'm puckering up my lips look. While I'm sure I think I look hot and flirty, he and the rest of the staff are hurling up the mid afternoon dim sum. I'm just saying so often the famous favorite that's been around forever can be stale and uninventive. But on a Sunday, the pork lo mein, crab puffs and broccoli and beef nicely soak up the cosmo overdose I suffered at the hands of the previous night bartender who overserved me. The nerve. Chow Mein yelpers!Ehhh, its ok. The best thing about this place is the service. We were in a large group of people and everyone was taken care of as if there were only a few of us. They even put our outside cake in the fridge for an after dinner celebration.

The food...it doesn't taste bad...and then again it isn't remarkable. I always end up (this wasn't my first visit) with the same thing, Garlic Green Beans and Fried Tofu. This is the most critter-less dish i can find on the menu. I don't know how you get so much grease outta green beans and fried tofu...I'm talkin' pork dish grease. Ok, so that's my gripe.

I'm pretty sure i'll go back for another birthday celebration or when there's a large group of people trying to decide what will satisfy everyone, or when i need a quick lunch that's not drive thru.Maybe I'm jaded from all the places I've traveled to and lived in, but I honestly didn't see the big deal about this restaurant.  True, their appetizers are decent and the Hot and Sour soup tasty.  But the main dishes we had -- Garlic Eggplant and a half duck -- both very highly recommended by other reviewers, were mediocre at best.  I suspect most Americans wouldn't know "real" Chinese if they saw it  and this restaurant perpetuates the myth, that what they serve is actual Chinese food  (after bringing a friend to a Chinese restaurant off of Northern (Wahsun), which makes real Chinese food, he was shocked to taste what real Chinese food is).  Most of the dishes at China Chili are overly salty and/or sweet  (to be fair though, as a diabetic, I usually avoid both, so I might be overly sensitive on that point).  The service is indeed excellent and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the party of 15 Latinos sitting next to us celebrating a birthday, who apparently think it's okay to have screaming children ruin everyone else's night.  But that's not the restaurant's fault, since machine gunning guests is (still) illegal and there was nothing they could do about it.

In summary, the food here is okay, with the appetizers being their strong suit.  I've tasted much better in the Valley and don't really think this place deserves all the hype it gets.  Then again, there ARE a lot worse Chinese restaurants out here, so this may be your best bet.  It doesn't hurt either, that they're open till 10pm; a remarkable exception in a city, where the norm is to close at 8pm or 9, even on weekends and which, of course, is ridiculous for a "major" city.

I truly recommend "Wahsun" in Phoenix, if you want to try real Chinese food.  I think most people would be surprised to discover how very different it is from what they're used to.  The food takes some getting used to, but once you get into it, you'll never go back to China Chili or their colleagues.I went here for my friend's graduation dinner.  We were served the traditional and authentic 10-course banquet-style dinner.  I didn't even know this place existed until that night!  The food is pure Hong Kong style cooking without the unnecessary frills --- just the way I like it!  The food comes hot and fresh and the wait stuff is friendly.  I can't remember every single dish that was served as it was an extremely festive night with lots of loud talking and cheers but I do recall the roasted duck and steamed fish in soy sauce with ginger and onions being amongst my favorite.  

Come for the delicious food and not the atmosphere because this place isn't that cute.  ;DThis place is a real dive-y dive. It's dim, has a small patio, interesting clientele (lol Browns fans), and yeah, it smells funny. Not that I could dwell on it for long when I was pouring white chocolate ale down the hatch. 'Twas heavenly! The selection of alcohol is actually pretty sparse, but the bartender knew what she was doing, so it's a-ok.

And then after you're hammered, there's the gay Denny's across the street. Best people watching ever.A total dive.  It's a decent size bar.  There were only a handful of people in there and it seemed like the ones sitting at the bar were regulars and knew eachother and the bartenders.

They have PBR...Awesome.  My husband had a jack and sprite and got a pretty generous pour.  The people seem nice.  

For you sport fans, this is an Ohio State bar.

There are pool tables, electronic dart board, corkboard darts, and several other games.

Didn't try their food, so can't really vouch for that.It's a nothing-special-place which makes it perfect in certain situations. If you are looking for a dive or a neighborhood bar where you can sit undisturbed this might really be an alternative for you.. but as for going out in any social setting I wouldn't say this is any place to write home about. 

I had their pumpkin porter. I knew it was a bad idea even when I ordered. My party was all about to be left to our own devices, so Hanratty's works. There is really nothing more to say about this place..  oh, yeah one more thing to say - the men's room has the most genuine and foul urine smell my nostrils have been abused by since I made a bad decision at the Coachella festival that one time.So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned.  Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile.  I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of.  Literally.

But here's why we'll still end up going back.  It's all about 3 things.  It's conveniently located.  It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.  ALL the time.  

Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate.I LOVE this place for their salad choices. The cons are that it is quite over-priced in my opinion and their soup choices are usually very bad. Souper Salad has much better soup choices but Sweet Tomatoes has a much better salad bar. If I have a coupon I will head here for lunch otherwise I steer clear because it ends up costing close to $12 for a buffet and drink, multiply that times 5 lunches a week...= = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DAILY LUNCH & DINNER BUFFET!  = = = =


I come here from time to time, but wow, I see that it's been almost 2 1/2 years since I gave it a review!  Things haven't changed much at all during that time.  Today they did have a new-to-me salad dressing, Smoky Ranch, which was good.

A plus (for some of us, anyway) is that this place is nice & NORMAL looking inside!  Some Sweet Tomatoes around the valley look like big metal farm buildings, inside & out!  The long salad bar at any Sweet Tomatoes is always good, with 2 or 3 pre-tossed salads up front, & then lots of ingredients along the line to make your own.  This location (only) has an odd setup for the soup.  They have about 3 or 4 out for you to help yourself to, & then up to 5 more across the kitchen that you can ask for them to serve you up some of.  I'd rather have them just have what they have, & put it all where we can reach it.  One reason for this is that Sweet Tomatoes is very short on MEAT, & at least if the Chicken Noodle Soup is out, you can dig big pieces of breast meat out of there & do what you wish with it, such as make a sandwich.  Today, this soup was one of them that was out of reach.

Daily Lunch & Dinner Buffet:  $8.99/$8.09 Sr. (Rev. 11/26/13)Dear Yoshi's.  You and I go way way back.  Remember that one time I ordered Combo #2 (Teriyaki chicken)?  Oh yeah I mean that was about 500 times.  Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok, eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now, Yoshi's, but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok, we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot, fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price.Katz Deli is indeed closed -- but the space will become a second Postino location.Love the stars!  They are the only thing affordable in this place!decided to take the fam out for dinner last night, was reallly craving a juicy burger and a beer. I do have to say that the beer was great, but the food was just meh. We started with the calamari and the beer bread with beer cheese for an appetizer. I wasn't a fan of the beer bread, but maybe I just don't like beer bread. Nothing was "wrong" with it, I we just weren't fans. The calamari was good, I liked it anyway.  

I decided to get the black and bleu burger with onion rings, wife got the crispy shrimp tacos, my son had a smaller cheeseburger with garlic parm fries and my little daughter had a grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. My burger was cooked perfectly, but was somehow bland. Not sure how, with the bacon and bleu cheese fondue, but it was. I think the meat was just underseasoned, but overall a decent burger. I have to say the onion rings were terrible, not very crispy and soooo much "breading". ick The wife's tacos were impossible to eat, super sloppy and just fell apart. My son reallly liked his burger and fries. 

On to the beer. I had an awesome red beer then a pilsner, both very very good. The wife had the light rail cream ale, that was also awesome. In the future, I'll go back for the awesome beer and maybe just a simple cheeseburger.This is a brewery. This rating is based largely on the beer. 

This beer is excellent. Uwe (pronunced Ooh-Va, I believe) is a beer genius. He is likely the best (professional) brewer in AZ. All of the beers are excellent. They have a good number of taps, and two (TWO!) casks (AKA Beer Engine: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_engine). This is the sign of a great place for beer. Selection is largely their own, which is what it should be at a brewpub! If you are looking for rice or corn beer (Bud/Miller/Coors) don't come here. 

They would be better known than Four Peaks but for one thing, the food (location as well, ASU helps the Peaks out quite a bit). Four Peaks has good beer, not great beer across the board though. They do however have an excellent menu. SunUp has an OK menu, that sometimes surprises, sometimes disappoints. 

The servers are all young women who do not seem to know beer and seem to be rather new at their job. I mentioned one of the top 100 beer bars in the country (Taste of Tops, one of the 2 on the list that is here in AZ. Papago is the other) and our server had no idea what I was talking about. She also did nor know whose Oatmeal Stout was in cask (it was their own) and answers about style were all memorized. I have a suspicion that she was not over 21, or not a beer drinker. Both are a liability when serving at a bar geared towards beer snobs like myself. 

Nonetheless, this is one of the best breweries in AZ, and if you don't go, you are missing out!Maybe its because of my age but I was not very impressed. It seemed that this place was..well kind of awkward. 

I had the nachos and they were decent, nothing to really complain about. If you not seated at the bar or the benches you are stuck with the tables which have barely enough room for three ppl. This means the three plates are pretty much touching each other and your best friends with the person sitting next to you.  Hope you don't have a space issue...

 I guess the place is for more of a couple setting.

I had one beer and left. Maybe go again...maybe.

R\_I'm a huge fan of local breweries. Been a while since I've been to Sun Up a few times this isn't on the top of my list of favorite Az breweries. I asked myself why and decided to try it again and my answer was simple. For me there isn't a huge ambiance when going here. Basically I find it boring.  Mainly because of the super tiny bar top once you enter. There are plenty of seats and a the place is actually big. 

Beer is just average in my book. Not bad, not great. Again I love local breweries, just Sun Up isn't on the top of my list. Just because its local, I know I'll give it another chance if I find myself in this area.Juan's is so-so, acceptable but the guacamole, salsa, and chips are not homemade. I have been coming here for about 10 years, although not frequently. We know the family that runs the place and everyone gives great service except for the owner who is unfriendly. Lunch hour is always packed, be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed. 

On our recent visit, our chips were cold and stale, you could taste the lard and the salsa is a runny type most likely from a bottle. At least that's what is tastes like. Nothing about the beans and rice stands out. The burritos are well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Good if you are in the area but given the choice of having to take a drive, you can find better Mexican elsewhere.Oregano's Shmeragono's... the juggernaut Italian restaurant chain in Phoenix has people waiting in line seven days a week. Must be amazing?! Must be soooo tastey?! Must have fantastic service and ambience?! No. No. And no. Most of the staff is definitely professional, speedy and fun. My take out gal the other day "scolded" me for arriving too early. 
"I said 25 minutes...whyd you get here too early?"
"To spend time with you, you prickly ass pear"
Anyway I hung out and waited my full alloted time. No biggie. I ordered 3 apps and 1 medium pizza. 
"That'll be $47 dollars please." says miss prickly ass pear.
I  arrive home to my $22 medium BBQ pizza. Thin crust. Nice sauce. Tastey all around. The stuffed mushrooms. Not so great. More salt then Salt Lake City. And at least a pound of crumbled Italian sausage. Portabellos were too slimy. Like bad canned fruit. Garlic cheese bread...well, come on how can you screw that up. My dog can make garlice bread (and it's not bad by the way). 
All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!A man came over to my house last night with a bag of food.  Luckily, I knew he was coming.  OK, it was a "dinner and a movie" date and he brought a huge bag from Oregano's.  
As I started to get out plates and silverware, he mentioned that paper plates, plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag.  Well, he sprung for dinner, I can clean a few plates, right?  
HUGE portions!  He brought spaghetti with marinara.  It was angel hair.  I think there *could* have been more sauce.  
The lasagna was their "Italian Flag" lasagna and really good!  Ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside.  The portion was enormous as well.  We both had a hunk and I had another one today for lunch.  
Both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container.  
The appetizer was something I'd never had before: Toasted Ravioli.  WTF???  Handmade ravioli, stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in.  There was definitely some kick to it, as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.
It was a very satisfying meal and I'm giving it three stars.  The portions were big, the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor.    
This was no Harley's meal, but for something quick and Italian, it wasn't half bad!  Of course, eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!I've been to Oreganos and I'm not sure why I keep coming back... oh yeah.. the Bellinis and the pazookie! 

The food is so-so and the food takes FOREVER. While their menus and servers give you fair warning that because they make everything from scratch that it takes longer to make. However, I know that its just a marketing ploy. The longer they make you wait (by telling you that perfection just takes time) the more you'll want it. By the time the food makes it to you, you're starving. At that point, everything tastes good, right?

Off the appetizer list, I have tried:
- the Guaca-Tony = fresh guac and pizza bread with WAY too much parm on them, also expect a 20 min wait
- the calamari = actually pretty decent, reminds me of mozzarella sticks though
- the garlic bread = wish the bread didn't come out of a plastic bag
- sweet potato fries = ok
- waffle fries = ok

Sandwiches
- italian sausage sandwich = spicy sausage, buy the jr size since the full size is too much, cheese looks fake and is not good if you have to reheat it the next day
- meatball sandwich = standard, no wow factor

Pizza = if you have about 90 minutes to wait, the pizza is pretty good. 

Have not tried any pasta but my friends have ordered it and it did not look amazing.

Bellini's = good strong mango/peach margarita

Pazookie= skip the food and just order one of these. It does take 20 minutes to make but you can choose between chocolate chip, white chocolate or peanut butter cookie. 

Service:
Slow. I'm not sure how many tables each server is assigned to but not only did we have to wait for our food, we waited for drinks to be refilled, waited for the server to bring us a box and waited for the bill. If you can't tell by now, lots of waiting.Everyone likes good Italian food, but not everyone likes pretentious places like Carraba's, or even that horrid Olive Garden. Come as you are, and enjoy some good pie. I like a good deep dish, and Oregano's doesn't disappoint. Get something like Gorgonzola and you'll thank me later! Just aim for the less traditional toppings and you'll be alright. I haven't had much of the entrees, but the portions are generous and the quality for many the same as you'll find at other chain Italian eateries.

The drinks are hit or miss. Order the frozen bellini, it's amazing no matter what the season!  

It's not the most original or tantalizing Italian fare, but Oregano's gets the job done. In style. Give it a try.

PS-Service improved greatly. Guest services was waaaay nicer than they had to be. Never turn down a place that cares about your experience!This was 4 star food but with 1 star service.  Since I am feeling nice today, they get rounded up instead of down.  It was a little bit later than normal dining time, 9:45, so it was nice to be able to go and have a nice dinner that didn't involve waiting forever to be seated or fast food.  

Once we were seated we were promptly ignored for quite a while.  Probably about ten minutes.  No one even came around to say they would be back in a couple minutes or that they were just busy at the moment.  Then the table next to us was seated, greeted, and got drinks all before anyone took notice of us.  Finally our grumpy server came by, said two words and then held up a finger, telling us to wait, while she talked to someone else.  Seriously?! WTF.  

I ordered a water to drink and the Chicken Yakisoba.  I downed my water within 10 seconds of getting it and waited until the end of the meal to get it refilled.  Hmph.  The food was really yummy.  The noodles were firm and the sauce was light and kind of sweet.  I really liked the veggies included, but I thought the chicken was kind of unnecessary.  It just didn't add anything to the meal. 

I think I will probably get some food from here again, but only in take out.  I'm not sure I could handle service like that again, especially since I can pretty much touch every end of the room when I stretch out my arms.I wish I could give this place more stars because the food is delicious, but the service is terrible!

I brought several people to this establishment to have lunch or dinner  over the last few months and the service is typically a 5. Never once has the server been attentive! One time, on a late business lunch, we watched our server sit at a few tables away and completely ignore our stares for the check. We literally waited half an hour as she chatted with other patrons. It was quite annoying to say the least, tips are earned not required! I mean come on! To this day she eyes me down when I come in for pick-up.

The Chicken Katsu is the best item on the menu! I would definitely order take-out, at least you can rely on that service. Very nice lady at the front!My introduction to Japanese cooking occurred years ago in Norwalk, Calif. It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.

I dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.

My initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.

After driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.

It's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.

Cherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.

A friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.

The California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.

Moving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef, this wasn't as spicy as I has hoped, but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste.

My eyes widened as my Ebi-Ten Udon Noodle ($8) arrived. It was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach. Along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting. Could this be what I've been searching for all of these years? After one sip my hopes plunged; just not quite the same. The flavor of the dashi, the basic soup stock used for udon, was a little too strong. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good bowl but, not quite the sensation I experienced so many years ago. Perhaps it's never as good as the first time.The price for happy hour is good, planning to come back again!We sat at the back corner and noticed we were surrounded with all Asians.
Hmm... is it because we're Asian, they had to put us in the back with rest of them?  I don't really care. 

I think our waiter was mad at the table next to us. He wasn't too attentive and sort of rude when we first placed our orders.  His personally changed after that table left.  I'm so glad they left.  They were so loud. 

I'm not sure if they have a new owner, or just simply being cheap & cutting on the potion size.  We had ordered the tofu shiitake mushrooms and got just three pieces.  What!  I have ordered this many times definitely more than three tofu's.  At the least the ramen still good.  The size is the same.If I could give it a 3.5 star I would. We were seated quickly, and the server was nice and prompt. My rating is more or so less based off the food experience. The bread was soft and sweet--Oh so good. The Tofu Steak came with a sauce and mushrooms which was a good starter with just the right amount of flavor. The pad thai tofu and tan tan men -vegetarian style was less desired with no variances in spice and little to no kick. I was disappointed, but it was decent it just lacked flavor which I hoped it hadFirst time at cherry blossom cafe, the food is very good 4 stars, however my server in particular very very rude and not helpful with menu questions, took him 20 minutes to bring the bread and appetizer, we ask for a side of rice in the middle of our food, we had to ask other servers for it, he just forgot, very bad attitude, I say to those guys if you don't like your job, do something else, don't serve peopleI used to go here a lot when I would be in Arizona for either kendo or work. I went back for the first time in a long while. I ordered the inari and vegetable tempura udon. The broth was pretty good along with the udon. The one thing that puzzled me was I asked for spinach in the udon and it tasted like cilantro? Maybe they had some mixed in with the spinach. Sorry but I do not like cilantro.Highlights of Christo's
* The neighborhoody Italian cafe feel of the restaurant.
* Decent food with run-of-the-mill upscale Italian variety.
* Piano jazz player serenading guests.
* Crowd with a decidedly old-money North Central Phoenix feel as opposed to the "I eat cat food and go to buffets" Sun City feel. 
* Professional servers with the memory of an elephant and the attitude of a menopausal woman.

I had not been to Christo's in a few years, but upon returning I found the food and atmosphere to be just as consistent.  The restaurant is very neighborhoody and inviting. The white tablecloths and piano player in the corner set the mood just right. You see diners here running into old friends at the bar. I did as well.  Little old bitties threw their judging looks our way from the bar, since our table of 20 is young, mostly female, we must all be lesbians, right?   Right.  

Consistently good food, not great and not excellent, but good.   Modest soups and side salads here are part of the drill.  I ordered the chicken limone, breaded and prepared similar to chicken picatta but minus the capers.  I tasted my friend's grilled salmon and penne and it was delicious. Considering out large party, the restaurant handled us OK, especially given the the busyness of the evening since it was Dining Out for Life evening where they donate proceeds toward HIV charities.

I extended the benefit of the doubt, but expressed concerns over the somewhat long wait time.   It was nearly 10 pm when we left given our 7:30 reservations, in which we were promptly seated.  Our server,  who was skilled at reciting the dozen or so specials of the day, was accommodating, up until the billing situation (which I prepared him for beforehand) - when he turned a little catty, but all was well in the end. This is a 3 star place with potential for four stars.I went in Karsh's against my better judgment because my friend really wanted to try something they had available.  They were surprisingly friendly and courteous, not one of their Mr. Hyde days, I thought.  It occurred to me to bring up my complaint about them because I so rarely enter their doors that what ever they thought didn't matter anyway.  It surprised me to learn that the management has brought in almost a whole new staff to replace the nasty ones. (I have to admit I looked and didn't see people I recognized from before. They were responding to continuing complaints.  I'll be going in again soon to get bread.  We'll see.If you read enough of my Yelp reviews, you'll notice that my second home is the crappiest dive I can find. Pomeroy's is no exception. I started coming here because my friends live within walking distance and is where they like to go. To be fair, I've never actually gone there on my own (without them) so I cant say I really choose the place. The bartenders are very very quick to remember your name and your drink, even though by the end of the night I always forget their names. The selection of games (shuffleboard, darts, pool, and arcades) is very good and worth the entertainment factor in their own. You never know what kind of crowd will be there, but mostly it is not a good one. I've had a lot of people try to start fights here, it's just a seedy and unruly bunch. That all said, overall I think it's an ok place to drink. It's inexpensive and the bartenders are great, and when it's all said and done, thats what matters the most about a bar.Dined here a few times for breakfast and lunch. Nothing to be too impressed by. The food is generally greasy, the tables dirty, and the service definitely lack-luster. 

The only reason I went in the first place was because my friend bragged about how awesome the place was. I left unimpressed.Not bad!  The fam and I went out for dinner tonight, and the Husband was happy to discover that Pizza Heaven not only has gluten-free pizza, but wings and pasta too!  A gluten-free trifecta!

It is great to have so many options, and the pizza and honey-hot wings were fairly tasty... but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  Just a basic casual pizza spot, where you won't be terribly embarrassed if your 4-year-old throws a temper tantrum.  Umm.. not that that happened to us, or anything... 

The highest point was the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive and took great care of us.  Thanks!I stopped eating my pizza to write this review. I'm so super bummed to see that PH has changed their vegan cheese from follow your heart to daiya.  Not to knock daiya because honestly it's a decent cheese but not on this type of pizza. I will probably not order again unless they switch back....Please bring back follow your heart!Went with a few friends for a birthday gathering of a co-worker.  I hadn't been to Apollos in years and wasn't really looking forward to it since the last time I was there it was a bunch of old guys, but I have to say it wasn't a bad experience.  The place has definitely changed.  It's WAY too bright in there, but the crowd was mixed old vs. younger (although not young) and the bartenders were pleasant.  One bartender was a little overboard talking bad about other bars, which kind of turns me off, but still friendly overall.  It won't be my 'hangout,' but it was fun for the night as long as you're with a group you know.I agree with the other reviewer.........this place is ok.  Food is not terrible...but it's not the best I've had.   I got the ribs w/ side + corn bread for $12.  That's about the going rate for 1/2 rack of ribs....but you sit outside at a table in the parking lot.

The BBQ is tasty......the meat was fairly tender but not hot.

If you're in the area, it's worth a try.  But, it's not in the same category as say Sam's Cafe or Keegans for ribs.So yesterday I went into the SAS at 1111 E Indian School Road, It was my first time in any of the SAS stores; I don't live in AZ, but I pass through this area and spend time here pretty often. I came in about 20 minutes before closing and moved through the whole store to check out what they had. 

I eventually found a big bin (cardboard boxes) that was full of remnants of some great stretch lace. It was marked "$3.99" and "108 inch". I found 3 pieces that I liked and made my way up to the cut table areas. A younger girl who looked like a wannabe Betty Page with glasses eventually called me to her table. Just to be helpful and make sure she knew where the remnants came from, I said to her, "They're from the 108 inch bin." There are a lot of bins and a lot of fabric in the place. 

Ignoring what I said, she turned the fabric length-wise and started to measure it the wrong way, 90 degrees from where she was supposed to. I politely said, " I think you're going the wrong way, it's 108 inch wide fabric. Since the remnant was actually only a yard long, the way she was measuring was going to make my total come out to three times the price that it was supposed to be. And since the other two remnants were about a yard and a half each, I was looking at being charged over $50 for $16 worth of fabric. Insufferable!

She picked the fabric up and held it out in front of her looking at what was clearly a cut edge, and said, "This is the selvage", and then went back to measuring it the wrong way again. She could have just moved her hands and eyes to what she was calling the end of the fabric and found the real and actual selvage in person, but somehow she did not dally there. She measured it out and came out with about 3 yards (yes, thats right, 108 inches) but still did not appear to make the connection. 

Now, at this point I realized what was happening, she was cordially inviting me to a quick round of "Stupid or Liar". Anyone who knows the first thing about fabric knows the difference between a cut edge and a selvage; particularly someone who WORKS AT A FABRIC STORE. I guess it is possible that I happened to catch her on the first day of her cut table career, or maybe she had just wandered in off the street and no one had yet noticed that she had snuck behind the counter, but this seems unlikely. 

Thus I can conservatively estimate the likelihood that she was lying to me was approximately 99.99% (with .0003% +/- margin of error).

The question is, why? 
Does she want to inflate the price because she gets a fat commission, or because she is actually the owner of the store? These both seem very unlikely. 

I can only surmise that she derives sheer pleasure from ripping someone off, even though there is no financial gain for her. 

Perhaps she thought I was an easy mark because I am male, and not the more typical (or stereotypical) flaming male who would know a lot about fabric. 

Maybe she is motivated by revenge on men because she recently took her car in to the shop, and the mechanic told her that the "number 6 transaxle injector stabilizer" needs replacing immediately and it will be $900 up front . She feels violated by a man who had her over a barrel due to her ignorance and now she wants to do the same to someone else. Who knows.

As it was late, the store was closing, and I was tired, I simply said to her, "Yeah that's OK" and walked out leaving the fabric on her table. And moreover, I'm not the kind of person who will go round and round with someone trying to tell them something that they should know already, I had already told her twice and that was probably one times too many; and she was in effect calling me a liar. If it's not a noticeable loss to do so, I think it's best to just step away from people like this instead of giving them some kind of weird fulfillment or satisfaction.

As I said before, this was the first time I went into an SAS fabric shop and I did not deal with any other employees, so I only have this young woman to base my review on. As for the rest of the store, I liked it a lot, which is the reason for  the three stars; they had a great selection of just about any kind of fabric you could want, and lots of bins full of knick-knacks, zippers, D-rings, thread, etc, etc. And the prices were good and cheap. I'm used to California stores like this where you pay through the nose for everything.

In the future I will go back and have a better experience, I trust.Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.This place is much better after the smoking ban took effect...for some reason this place has a terrible ventilation system, and even when I was a smoker I couldn't stand the eye-burning smoky interior.

That said, it's fun to go on a Tuesday for 2 for 1...lots of guys and a generally positive environment.  All the TVs tend to be a distraction when everyone is really there just to check out the crowd and drink, although I think on slower days there may be some genuinely sports minded guys.I had a burger & fries.  Good service, good food but too expensive.  They even charged me for requested BBQ sauce, kinda offensive.I used to drive past here and say, huh, I should go there one day.  It became a joke.  The girlfriend and I would drive past and before I could say anything she's say, "Yea, yea, we're going to go there one day."

So we went there.  And....  we most likely won't go back.  

It wasn't particularly bad per se, but we've had better.  It was alright, and they had a decent selection, but nothing was really great or stood out to us.  

Maybe some day, if we drive past it enough, we'll start up the joke again saying how someday we should give it another shot.  But unless we are hit by some kind of massive Chinese buffet cravings while we're right down the street, I don't think we'll be there any time soon.The pizza is good, although not the best amongst local kosher pizza places. They offer a great lunch special of a slice of pizza and soda for a discount. 

The Sunday and Wednesday night "Mexican" menu is delicious. Make sure you order early because 80% of the time, they run out of food by 5 or 6 pm.

The friendliness of the staff is hit or miss. Arturo is amazing and wonderful.I came here for lunch last week with some friends to celebrate my belated birthday. We were disappointed Cafe Monarch was closed for the summer and we were looking for somewhere that was BYO because we were hauling around our wine. Viola! Coup de Tartes! 

We all share so we can try a bit of everything (we do this pretty much everywhere) and we started with the goat cheese on toast and the onion tart. Both came with salads that were nicely dressed in vinaigrette's. Both appetizers were good, though the onion tart outshined the goat cheese. The tart was creamy, oniony and delicious. Everything we could hope for. Everyone enjoyed it. The goat on toast was exactly that:  Cheese on toast. It tasted good because I like goat cheese so much and it reminded me I needed to pick more up at the grocery store, but it really was nothing exciting. In fact, it's getting by far too much face time now. 

For the entree we kept it light to save plenty of room for dessert. We shared the seafood salad and the ham and brie sandwich. The sandwich was just ham and brie on an average baguette. Like something you'd pick up at Safeway. The baguettes at Lee's Sandwiches are much better and the ham on the sandwich was the processed stuck-together loaf kind (like the Oscar Meyer packaged type). I've had by far better ham and brie sandwiches for two euros in the metro stations in France. Granted, that was in France but you get my drift. Clearly, we should have gone with the lamb sandwich. The salad was loaded with seafood and the dressing was fine but it didn't make me want to lick my plate and that's what I was looking for. Enough said. 

Next course, dessert. We ordered their seasonal tart, the smores, the "famous" bananas foster brulee and the one I was looking most forward to, the dark chocolate salted caramel. First the salted caramel tart.. I had a fellow dark chocolate salted caramel lover at the table so we both dug right in and we were equally disappointed. It miraculously tasted nothing like chocolate, caramel or salt. Just sweet goo. I don't think we even finished it. The banana brulee tart was good, though not as good as I remembered it. The hi-light of dessert, surprisingly, was the smores. I was a little jaded because it came with milk chocolate (I'm a die hard dark chocolate lover and you know what they say, one you go... nevermind) but damn, that thing was good. A little graham cracker crust filled with creamy milk chocolate and topped with a toasted marshmallow. That plate deserved to get licked! 

I had been here once before a few years ago for dinner and I was disappointed that the lunch menu only had sandwiches and salads on it. I understand the need to keep it simple and quick, but not even a single entree? Nothing was bad but aside from the onion tart and the smores tart, nothing was a standout. I was just a little disappointed.After Yelp's amazing reviews, we decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. Initially, I was super excited from the outside with this cute little French restaurant. The service was nice and the owner even came by our table to greet us....THEN, the food came. The tomato and pepper soup was DRENCHED in salt. Our party had two members with high blood pressure so the soup was subsequently passed to me. Then, came the meal. The opah - which was the special of the night and recommended by the owner - smelled so so bad. It tasted just as bad. The duck, which was supposed to be their more recommended dish, was covered with fat. Ugh. They refunded our opah but gave us back our gift certificate, which we probably have to throw away now since none of us are bothering to come back.I really wanted to love this place.  I really did.  The atmosphere is cool, the feel of the buildings are charming, but I really have to grade my experience during Restaurant Week as average.  I came with a party of 5 and they could only seat us in the courtyard.  During Winter in Phoenix, this wouldn't be a big deal.  But even with the shade of the courtyard, it was pretty toasty.  As for the food?  My mixed green salad was pretty dry.  The heat outside might have had something to do with it, but it just wasn't that impressive.  I had heard all the hype about the lamb (part of the reason I chose this place for restaurant week and it was good.  The cous cous provided a good texture to go with it.  For dessert I went with the cherry lava cake.  Pretty good, but the cake itself was also pretty dry.  The service as a whole was fine as they fed us each meal pretty quickly.  The fact we could bring our own wines was also a plus.  Would I go back here?  Probably.  But next time I'll make a bigger push to sit inside.Good, but nothing really outstanding.  Service is friendly and attentive here.  The salsa has quite a kick.  I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas.  Good flavor, wish they had a bit more of a cream sauce or something.  Unfortunately, they did a number on my digestive system the next day..  Good choice for Mexican but does not really stand out from any of the other various choices.Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!I have fond memories of Long Wong's from my childhood. My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong's was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says "kid friendly" like a hippopotamus trash can. If you are a single dad who doesn't know how to cook, you should definitely take your kid here for dinner. 

Since it had been at least two decades since I'd been inside a Long Wong's, last night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. 

We did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it's at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn't travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can't beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. 

I'm definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy.What counts as a "pub"? This is just a small dive bar.

Staff was friendly. They don't kick people out right away after 2. You can stick around here. I went to ask for a menu just to see what they offer here. I just wanted a paper take-away menu but she was going to hand me an official menu. Would she have served me food after 2am?! There's just no way...

The pool table is tiny. It's the smallest table I've seen.

The food is not pub food. At least, not any pub food I've ever seen. Most everything is $6 or under. The Friday Fish Fry is $6.50. Saturday Night New York Steak is $10.25.

Tip: Park in the rear. Use the back door.Went and checked out the place last Saturday. The ambiance is rustic I think. Parking was tricky and definitely not friendly unless you have a compact. The hostess was very friendly. Since the place supposedly has great chicken fried steak, that's what I ordered. To say the portion is ginormous is an understatement. You get two of them that the size as big as your head. The breading's texture is great with a nice crunch. The steak is very tender and not dry. My only complaint would be that the food is BLAND! The breading definitely could've used some flavor or spice and so did the gravy. Odd that the steak is such huge portion but the gravy is very much skimped on. I liked it, but it definitely could use some major seasoning. Maybe they can steal it from Chili's. Even though Chili's is a chain, they have one of the best chicken fried steak I've had. Texaz grilled would've definitely got 4 stars if they seasoned the CFS.Walking in, the decor was just ok.  We had the chicken fried steak, kids prime rib, and rib eye.  The prime rib was smoked and they didn't say that on the kids menu and it had an odd taste to it.  I liked the ice cream cup at the end of my meal.

Editing to three stars.  GREAT customer service.I've passed this place hundreds of times, and finally came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  This place is an unapologetic dive with a unique charm.  They do have a fun "game room" with a pool table and other bar games.  The menu is fairly limited to burgers, fries, and other traditional bar fare.  They also only have two beers on tap, Bud and Bud Light.  

I ordered the 1/3 lb. wineburger and a side of fries.  The burger was tasty but nothing to rave about.  They served a generous portion of fries, which, like the burger, were good but not outstanding.  Surprisingly the service was excellent, which may be due to it being a slow night.  The server/bartender/cook was very attentive, asked about the burger, made sure I always had a drink, and even repositioned the TV so I can better watch a preseason game.  

Overall, it was a good experience (3.5 stars if Yelp allowed halves).  The food is good (between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant), the prices are more than reasonable, and the service was great.  If I go back, I would definitely try the 2/3 lb. burgers, which looked like a better choice.The food here was good.  I got the Vegas roll, which was delicious except the pieces were HUGE.  I had to eat each piece in two bites, with my hands, so I wasn't too happy about that. I prefer to eat sushi with chopsticks to avoid the mess.

At first I attempted to order the sushi combo.  I wanted to substitute the spicy tuna roll for something else (even another 1/2 Kalifornia roll that already comes with it), but they wouldn't let me.  That was a big let down.  Other than that, my fiance ordered the pad thai, which he liked, but it wasn't the best ever.

The best thing about Moto was the sushi ice cream, called mojos.  They are delicious!  A small order came with 6 pieces, I think, and that was too much for us.  It was a good deal for the money. I would highly suggest ordering it if you have room in your tummy (which is why I only ordered the Vegas roll).

The patrons seemed to be mostly in their 20s and 30s.  I think that's a good sign.  I'm giving Moto three stars because of their lack of substitution options and their high prices for sushi.  Their rice bowls seem like a good deal, though.The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. That's the direction I recommend if you come here.Not too many sushi choices in the area. Visited a month ago. Place was kinda busy, but our rolls came out pretty quick. Everything was fresh and overall service was good. I would give it another chance.This is the Starbucks for those of you Big Bang Theory wannabe and jock fans.  It's an interesting mix of customers that hang out here.  Service is hot and cold here.  Weekdays tend to be better, Saturdays service is sketchy as the barristas tend to be apathetic and hung over so you may need patience for that drink.  I showed up on a Saturday with 3 people in front of me and my grande peppermint mocha took 30 minutes.  I showed up on a weekday with 6 in front of me and it took 15.  Rock paper scissors, service consistency is not aligned with other locations.This location seems to be low in stock on a few items. I went to purchase Aqua Di Gio the other day, and they were out of the smaller bottles. The whole men's cologne section looked a little bare.
Another thing that isn't the greatest here is the parking. The whole lot facing Camelback Road is a total cluster. I started parking on the other side, by Fry's and PetSmart, and it's been a little better. I only stop at this location when I'm in the area.I'm from Chicago and KNOW real italian beef w/peppers,etc. The sandwich was good, but pricey. THIS is my real BEEF: I stood at the counter for five, yes five, hungry minutes before anybody took my simple order. Seems they were too busy (it was 3:30 pm) to bother with me. For the money, I would expect better service.Marshalls has been one of my top go-to places for finding deals on decent clothes for years. I've had this one, located in the Camelback Colonnade shopping center, in my sites for a couple months now.

I finally made it over here on a Thursday afternoon. The first thing I noticed was that the parking lot was a Mad House. This may have been because it was Halloween, and there's a Spirit Halloween store in the shopping center.  So I won't dwell on that, and besides, chaotic parking lots in Phoenix seems to the norm.

Once inside it looked like any other Marshalls until I got to the men's section. It was definitely not as well organized as other Marshalls I've visited. The clothes on the racks weren't too bad. There were some shirts and jeans hung out of the correct size section but not too bad. 

It was the dress shirt section that blew my mind. I'm talking about the area with the folded, packaged button-up shirts. The ones that sometimes come all pinned up so you can prick your fingers when you're unwrapping them... yeah those ones. 

It was like a tornado had come through and dispersed the shirts where ever it damn well pleased. Some shirts were hanging out of packages. Very few were in the right spot and I couldn't find my size in any of the ones I liked. Not finding the right size is something that just happens at Marshalls, I get that. However, it hasn't happened to me too often. The bottom line is that dress shirt area was a disaster.  

I'll still come back to find the occasional deal, but if you're looking for a store that is well organized... this is not the Marshalls you are looking for.The food was delicious. The service on the other hand was horrible. I could get better service at The Applebee's that just shut down in chandler. I'm normally a 5 star giver. But the service was embarrassingly backwardsWent to Arriba today for my second time.  My first time for lunch and tried the $4.99 chicken chimi lunch special.  The service was good for the most.  Good salsa served with the chips.  Everything was good for the most part, Chimichanga was served with rice and beans.  Good enough flavor.  Nothing spectacular.  The Chimi was a bit smaller than it looked on the add and what I am used to seeing at other places(probably about the size of three tacquitos rolled together), but well worth five bucks.  Still I am not a fan of deception, speaking of which when I ordered I was asked if I wanted Sour Cream and Guacamole, which I thought was an offer not an upsell.  It ended up coming up to $2.25 together, nice job bumping up my bill by 50%.  Overall though I would return and just avoid the upsells.  The food is good, not great, but you will not find a whole lot better for $4.99.I know I know I'm gonna get some flack because of this... but yelpers... my experience here was 2 stars for service and an additional star for food. I think a restaurant experience should match its rating caliber and sadly it did not. No four stars for fabulousness, it's three stars because it's ok and that's not shabby at all.

Went to dinner with the other half of our awesome pair... my besty Sara V. on a whim. We've been thinking alike lately... and while I was at work... I kept on thinking that it would be nice to go out to dinner... and unsurprisingly Sara V. was thinking the same too... I swear it's like we have ESPN or something! Anywho, I had her come up with the dinner choices since she knows I'm a really picky person (I say I'm not but I really am =P), she texted me the top 3... and I chose PCG since I had read Jana S. earlier review on the place and I've always wanted to try out this place!

Anywho, we got to the restaurant and I really like the intersection it's at, at Bethany Home Rd. and 16th St. coz it's across from Luci's Market and Richardson's, and an awesome looking Starbucks. In a strange way that intersection has a little character plus it's in an older section of upper central Phoenix. I like the setup with the tables outside and the large picture windows. 

We were seated immediately at a two seater booth, noticed it was quite busy, and i liked the general ambiance of the place. We were thinking of the happy hour when we were heading there but were dismayed to read on their large easel board that hh tues. - fri. was from 3p to 6p but on Monday's it's from 3p to close. So we made a mental note that we'll come back for hh on Monday. We were seated and waited for our server, waters were dropped off, and our server passed with a passing remark "I'll be right back". Well she did come back after 10 mins. which I ordered a glass of reisling, and an order of the Roasted Green Chile Fundido Queso (ever since our trip in Austin for SXSW last year, we've been looking for a place that serves Queso as to satisfy our Queso fix from TX of which we have yet to find a place, maybe it's a Texas thing). My glass with a small carafe of wine was served... wet. The wine glass was wet! Like it had been just washed and they didn't take the time to dry the glass, no they served the glass WET and our server poured some of the reisling into the WET wine glass. Ok... there went a star. who serves wine in a wet glass?!? apparently PCG does. So, we're waiting to order, mind you, our server did not stop to give suggestions, mention the soup of the day, no we waited, and we had to ask for suggestions, and ask what the soup of the day was. Heck if you're a good restaurant, wouldn't you want to welcome your customers, who if you win them with good service and good food will come back, or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you're not interested in winning a few more? Ok... deep breath. 

I ordered the PCG pasta as suggested by our server, and Sara V. ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs (rubbed in Chipotle bbq sauce). Oh did I mention that I had to ask for Sara V.'s water refill the first time round and flag her down to get a diet coke. Sara and I could see the poor girl was handling way too many tables to guarantee good service but that's no excuse. I think there's an expectation that a restaurant of such acclaim should provide great service. 

The PCG pasta was quite good, liked the roasted garlic and chardonnay cream sauce, it wasn't overly creamy, loved the sun dried tomatoes though, it was delicious. Sara V.'s baby back ribs had a kick with them, it was spicy! and the green chile cornbread was okay not bandera's skillet corn bread good though. Oh, the queso was alright as well except i wish it was a little more thicker, this queso seemed too runny but it was a good starter nevertheless. We finished our meal with a slice of the buttermilk pie which had a caramel sauce and pomegranate seeds as garnish, which was the right accompaniment to something rich and sweet. 

Overall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience. I will come back for the happy hour but I will have to pass on a glass of wine... unless they can guarantee it'll be served in a dry wine glass. And maybe some attentive service. So hopefully next time I'll get my four stars, we'll see.I can't comment on anything except for the returns/exchanges department. We went to return a part for a fridge that we ordered online and there was quite a long line by the customer service department (it was lunchtime). They could have brought a few more personnel over to help. The return itself was pretty pain-free - he scanned the item and returned the funds to my credit card.excellence in service, professionalism and care. your and my last bastion of a physical store to try out, touch and feel the devices you've only seen on channel 31769 (or was it 31770?) and ad-pushed to your phone, all before you shop online for the best price for delivery to your home (if you're not overcome by the impulse to buy and the not-so-subtle cues given by the store's name and signage).

when i went to check out with my new bluetooth portable speaker, the last one on the shelf, and not the color i wanted, the cashier kindly asked -- as usual -- "did you find everything you were looking for?" taking the opportunity, i told her that i really wanted the black one, which was on display, but that this was the only one left.

"OH!" she replies and begins on her touchscreen-enabled register to peck away until she shows that according to the system there is one more in the store and then leaves the register with me to look on the shelf, consult with her floor manager, and then off she goes to the back room.

A few minutes later the manager approaches me to apologize and offer me $10 off the one I had as an inconvenience! Wow. A-Plus-For-Effort!


And now... Enter Keith Olbermann. Spotlight please! ...

you'd never find me reviewing a chain like this, but the service i receive there is stellar.

i feel terribly irresponsible when i give my custom to a monopoly like best buy from whom i am given a very limited selection of choices which have been hand-picked by a few buyers from a very select few manufacturers and brands. this selection is the one that i and all my fellow americans are programmed to choose from as we're instructed by our google-controlled devices and choicepoint-profiled ads.

...thank you Mr. Olbermann.

i remember easily my hajj-like sojourn to the worldwide mecca of electronics in the side-by-side 10-floor-building temple-stores of Shibuya in Tokyo. like one giant nintendo world, there are people dressed like princess peach and all the female store clerks speak like her (it is part of japanese service etiquette).

every square inch of every surface, and then multiple signs hanging in your path and carried by people standing in your way are COVERED with ads for products and services. a blaring fast-talking ad-broadcast roars overhead through the mounted speakers while individual yellers are stationed every 15-25 feet with their own megaphones pushing whatever they're standing next to. flashy strobes and colored LEDs scream at you from all directions begging, "over here! look at me!" sensory overload ensues in just a few minutes. awesome! all that's missing is the massive C-Major ding-ding chord of the slots. :P

i wonder why this kind of mass commercial mayhem can't break through to mainstream USA. we'd eat it up! we'd gorge ourselves like swine, swipe-and-signing our way to swaggering shopping oblivion.I really love the duck sandwich at their deli which I never had before.  The wine bar is treat too for washing down your food and plenty of outdoor seating for a group meet.  The rest of the place is kind of confusing in terms of the varying stuff that they have for sale. I'm not sure how it blends in with the deli but then again, this is an opportunity to try out a new place.This CVS is relatively close to home and other shopping, so it's convenient in that regard. You have your standard CVS stuff: cards, toiletries, light groceries, drinks, makeup, a photo processing area, magazines, toys, and a pharmacy. This location has a drive-up pharmacy. 

Parking can be tough due to the busy shopping area it's in, and panhandlers are a near-constant presence by the entrance.It was picking up my number and such for a 5k that made me finally swing by The Runner's Den. Having an excuse to walk around the store and check out the wares, the end result was that it was okay, but still made me miss other running stores I had come to love and adore.

Some of the perks?
** When I was finally able to get the attention of an employee to try on some Five Fingers, he was super nice and knowledgeable. We shared running stories and talked about techniques and workshops available through the store.
** They have group runs as well as classes on form and technique that are free. Considering I run like a buffoon, this may do me some good.

Some of the not so good?
** Parking is atrocious. Luckily my little car fit into a spot on the side that requires tetris-esque skill to get in and out of.
** Staff was pretty hard to find. Not sure if they're always that busy or just were because people were picking up race packs, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get someone's attention.
** Neither the running shoe or even the brand I wear seemed to be available. 

It will probably be a good place to pick up the little things like goo, a new visor or running shirt, socks, etc... but not sure it will be my first choice for anything major, like a new pair of shoes.Initially I was not satisfied at all with the way Data Doctors had handled my situation.  My computer had a serious virus, and after dealing with Data Doctors, I threw in the towel and ended up just buying a new computer. In fact, I was unhappy enough to write a fairly negative review here on Yelp, giving them 1 star.   Fast forward 9 months and I get an email though Yelp from the Director of Operations at Data Doctors.  Seeing my negative review, he apologized and wanted to make the situation right.  Although I already had a new computer, I was interested in donating my old computer to charity, but still needed the viruses removed and the computer reformatted to remove all my personal information.  He made arrangements to have that taken care of at no cost to me, which I really appreciate.  Although it started out as a bad situation, in the long run I am glad to see that they take customer satisfaction seriously.Was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker.  Had a "eh" experience.

An "eh" experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else.  And that sums up my experience.

Service had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.

We had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.  

Overall, I'll go back for some HH specials but I'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people.  I'll stay up by 16th and Bethany Home instead.I absolutely loved my first visit to this restaurant. So much, in fact, that we decided to take some family here over the holidays. Our service on this visit....sucked. And that's being nice. I asked our waitress if she was new, but she said she had been there over a month. After asking on 5 separate occasions for water, we finally flagged down another waiter and asked him. I do love the ambience...but will the "lodgey" feel be appropriate when it's 110 degrees outside? The food is good, but pricey.This is a friendly bustling neighborhood-type place which I love.  The three stars only are for having fish on the menu that isn't up to the standards of their beef dishes and apps. Sea bass smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with chiles, not very fresh and overcooked --uggh.  However, I did croon over my neighbor's beef dish. The crab mini-tosadas are really good. And the vegetable side dishes-all of them, including brocolini, brussel sprouts, potato in a pot, and asparagus--are commendable.  Great atmosphere!! Have fun.I have been there a few times, both at the Rokeriji and Richardsons, but today I shall do a review for the Rokeriji.    First off, since they are side by side and have the same owner, I am giving both restaurants three and one-half stars.   I have had pan-seared salmon and the beef tenderloin skewers off of the "small plates" menu.    Both are cooked and flavored to perfection.   Yummm!!   Last night for dinner I had the carne adovada, and my companion had the chimayo chicken.    I tasted his chicken, and, yes, it was good but nothing outstanding.   I liked my meal much better.   His side dish of the potato on the poblano was typical mashed potato with a chili flavor.     I guess that would make sense since it was sitting on the chili.   I asked our server how hot the red sauce was for the pork.   She stated that if it wasn't quite hot enough, she could bring a hotter sauce, which she did.   The pork was flavorful, but it could have used more sauce.   The rice and beans and flour tortilla were average, typical I guess one could say.    I ordered a glass of their red wine.    Sorry.    I can't remember the name of it, and the wine list isn't posted so I can't access it.    It was $15/glass, and it was heavy bodied, just the way I like it.    I would go back, especially since it is conveniently located.    Is it outstanding?    No.    I wouldn't say so.Decent pizza for a chain.  We ordered a side of meatballs which were just ok.  There was too much bread crumbs and not enough spices.  We ordered the "thin crust" which isn't what you normally expect.  The "thin crust" was really just the standard pizza crust.  Would come back but definitely not very memorable.Big Lots is a Big Lots is a Big Lots.  Not sure why everyone was so disgusted by it, it wasn't terrible at all.  Same ol' same ol'I have eaten here three or four times, mostly because a friend at work really likes the suppli (risotto balls).  Their food is okay.  I have a simple test for any restaurant to classify as being at least 'good' it must make me close my eyes.  Never happened here with any dish I've tasted, suppli included.  And they serve Pepsi products....echhhhh....the ultimate sign of a cheap-ass restaurant owner...
The service is friendly though and it's always good to get out with Melissa!!This is a good lunch place...only been there twice and ordered a meatball sub both times but it was really good and too big for me to finish.  I'll definitely be back for that.OK...so I am waiting for Yelp to get into the half a star system so things aren't so cut in dry, I gave this place a 3 but it probably is more like  a two and a half star joint..

OK so my first day in Phoenix this was the first place I had ever eaten, a friend of mine took me there and afterword asked me how I liked my grilled cat;) in any event then this place was a dump, and I might of thought that he was serious about the fried cat in my burritos, now since that time this place has come quite a ways but not quite that far. 

As far as the drive thru goes it is super fast, and going inside is not suggested, it is a bit dirty and even when it looks clean you still have the feeling like your in a scene from Joe's apartment and the roaches are hiding around every corner and under every napkin holder waiting to jump up and start water skiing across your salsa dish. The food ranges on decent, I always end up with the carne asada burrito or super nachos which is enough for two people to say the least. 

 But I have had some bad experiences their two, where the burritos feel like they were dipped in beef water not good...or the nachos are so greasy that they eat through the Styrofoam container they are served in. 

The staff is friendly for the most part, and this place is ALWAYS open! 

This is my late night nothing else is open except jack in the crack I am hungry but not that hungry place to eat.

 I would have to say stay away from any place that has the word berto's in it which I think is Mexican for fireass, but in general this location is good enough for me to yelp about it, I would say yelp it at your own risk, but for after hour drunk food it will suffice.Stayed at the RC during a biz trip this summer in Phoenix.  The only RC I had ever experienced was one in NYC.

When we arrived, I thought the same as Cheri A.  Was this a HoJo?  

I notched it up to maybe they were trying to fit in with the Arizona desert barren look.

Everything about the hotel was OK...when it could have been great.

The Ritz Carlton is known for excellence but everything just fell short at this Phoenix location.  Perhaps, the local management needs to visit the more seasoned sister locations in NYC.  Only then, will it be known what it takes to fully represent the brand name of Ritz Carlton.I lunched here today with a few business connections, we all had dark pants on (this is important to remember). The wait staff was very good and the gentleman who seemed to be the busboy was even better. Not only did he move quickly to clean up a glass of spilled water he validated my parking - where were the others, I have no idea.

The food was fair - the steak in my wrap was a bit dry and the fries were cold. But, it was good. My belly/gut approves.   

My only suggestion for them is, better linens - lint was all over our pants! Always great when you are off to another meeting.

I have been here a few times... Never REALLY impressed!Not bad for a small restaurant on a golf course. My sandwich was done perfectly (Adobe melt), but I wasn't a big fan of the tiny fries. Service was below par though as one server was visibly annoyed by doing her job.I don't really like going to bars that are dimly lit and swanky before it's dark outside. There's really nothing worse than going inside a dark lounge, letting your eyes adjust while you enjoy a drink, and then exiting to the glaring sun. My husband and I met a few of his co-workers here for a drink on Friday around 6 pm. Stepping through the velvet drapes to enter is a lush touch and the decor, especially the modern art behind the bar, was sensational. The drinks were pricey but well-mixed, and the bartender was really helpful and professional. I just wasn't feeling the atmosphere at that time of night. I'll reserve any major critique of this place until I have a chance to come back another time later at night. I can see this place being a romantic spot for a late night cocktail or glass of wine, and I will definitely give it another shot. For now, I'll just give it three stars and call it a sophisticated, but dark, spot to get a decent, but pricey drink!Neither great, nor bad I think that is how all chains get 3 stars. Their menu is craftily made by a test kitchen making sure not to offend any pallet. In the process they don't  seduce anyone mouth either.

I frequently had lunches delivered from here to meetings, and I also dined in the restaurant too. 

For delivery I quickly learned to stay away from anything with a dough component, from egg rolls to pizza it was always Luke warm and soggy by time I sunk my teeth in to it.

One of my preferred dishes for both delivery and in store dining is the Thai Linginni. It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix. However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me.  This is also one of the cheaper items on the menu.

I have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter.

As for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a "mushroom pesto" that is quite earthy and greasy. 

Included with a meal is bread and butter, the Italian bread here is fairly good with firm crust and airy body.The food was good but I just didn't like the atmosphere. It seems more like a cafeteria than a deli.I have a love/hate relationship with the Cheesecake Factory and I have been to a few, Palo Alto and SJ, CA, Seattle, WA and now Phoenix, AZ.  Love the food, the portions, vast selections of appys', entrees and desserts.
Hate the wait and lack of reservations.  The Biltmore Hotel called in a reservation for us for a table of 8 for 6:30pm on Sunday.  It wasn't a reservation, nor a pseudo reservation, we ended up being seated at 6:50 pm.  If you don't get there (any of the restaurants early, before 5pm, expect a wait.)

I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, $15, extremely yummy and enough to share with 5 others and chicken and biscuits, $21, enough for 3 meals.  The biscuits are airy like Marie Callenders corn bread, I got 3 chicken breasts and plenty of gravy.  Friends ordered the Steak Diane, excellent mushrooms, miso salmon, shepards pie, just to name a few.  Everything was so good.

The downside of our experience at this restaurant was the ordeal of no reservation and our waiter was inattentive, we had to ask for our drinks and appy's.  Had to ask the manager to find out what was going on with our waitstaff and order.  Hopefully, this was not the norm at this location.I went to Phoenix to spend time with my Grandmother. She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward. This is how we ended up at CF. She was starving and knew they had a lot of options and she didn't feel like Miracle Mile (and I knew I could eat at the one in Arrowhead)

Cheesecake Factory is CF. I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her....

She let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there. 

The reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH. Had he come back to tell me this himself, he would have bumped up the star rating in service...

Gram said she likes the location in the Arrowhead area better, though we did have a good time talking about all the changes in Phoenix and the Biltmore area.Minus the 20 page menu and bad reputation for being overpriced and not that good, I kinda like this place. So shoot me. I came to this location for a drink, so I can't say anything about their food, but Doug, the bartender, is awesome. I immediately asked him what the weirdest thing that has ever happened to him was, and he was more than willing to share his stories.. something about eggs, I don't really remember (blame it on his shot count, which was well over 5 seconds) from there he was chatty Cathy till the tab was dropped. 

If and when I come back here, I will get my usual - Tex Mex eggrolls to start, followed by the Chicken Madeira, and the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to complete a totally unhealthy ungodly amount of above average food.

Cheers Doug!So the first time I was considering going to this location, I was warned from my friends who work in the area that the last time they were there that they had to give some sort of warning due to a hepatitis a issue they were having...

Anyhow, onto the actual review... the food overall has been mediocre at best.  Usually something's overcooked or bland.  The service each time has been relatively good.... and the personalities tend to surface.  The second to last time I went with a friend and we had dessert.  Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.  To the point of us being ever so slightly uncomfortable, but she did claim to have gained tons of weight at the start of her job due to having a slice every time she worked.  I suppose if you're surrounded by it, it could happen.

Dinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide.

This definitely is not my choice of places to go, but usually more like a... oh, we know it's open, it's not that far, and no one is in the mood for anything specific sort of place.There's a enormous selection of food to choose from- so not only cheescakes here.  I had dinner here, had the chipotle pasta, etc... There was a long wait for our food after we ordered- about 30 minutes... The food was good, everything was cooked okay, but was not a fan of the bread in the basket- the taste was bit off.  Our service was okay and the waiter checked on us throughout our meal.  I did try their cheesecake- nothing too different from any other one.  The only thing I could suggest to the restaurant is maybe increase the lighting just a bit more.Food was good, but expensive. Atmosphere is a little too casual to pay $70 including tip for 2 people. Felt like a Mimi's Cafe plunked down on Camelback. Also we look for a place where the bar isn't so much the focal point.This is a nice location. We were seated quickly and our food was quick to come out. 

We sat in a booth that was like sitting on a bench. We noticed the other booths were well padded. I don't know if this was intentional but it was uncomfortable after about 30 minutes and we ended up getting our meals to go. That was a definite draw back.While on a business trip, we decided to order from here.  We ordered through the facility we were at and they handled calling in and getting our orders.

I got the Chicken Madeira.  This dish consists of pounded chicken breast with some light breading and cheese melted on top with a few stick of asparagus.  The side is a chunky mashed potato dish.

Since we didn't eat there, the food got to us a bit cold.  The dish was good though.  The portion was huge.  There were two chicken breasts and I only managed to eat one and half of the mashed potatoes.  Could get a bit overwhelming with all the oil from the cheese.

It's Cheesecake Factory.  It's a chain.  Can't expect some fine dining.Food great
Crazy at 7.00 pm lights automatically dimmed in entire restaurant and guests were eating by cell phone lightBistro 24 is a nice, romantic restaurant in the Ritz Carlton.  The decor and service is spectacular; but the food, on the other hand, could still use some work.  We had a prix fixe menu, consisting of the farmer's market salad, short rib or salmon entree, and a peanut butter ice cream chocolate cake or the carrot cake with cheesecake topping.  I think our farmer's market salad was missing the dressing or seasoning.  There was nothing flavorful or tasty in that dish. Both the entrees were delicious. The salmon had a crusty finish, cooked to perfection over creamy polenta and the short ribs were tender, melt in your mouth, with the perfect mashed potato partner.  The desserts were average, but too sweet for me, and I had a pretty big sweet tooth.  The carrot cake cheesecake dessert was moist and the cheesecake topping was good.  The chocolate cake was very dense and the peanut butter ice cream tasted like straight peanut butter and sugar.  What was awesome about this restaurant is the executive chef came out to each table after the entrees were served to talk to his guests...now talk about service!  

Overall: Food alright but would not go back.  Prices: Expensive.Capital Grill is what is is. A steakhouse chain. It's predictable and classy atmosphere is great for business entertaining. With so many food options here in Phoenix, I certainly wouldn't take an out-of-towner here.The Gyro was decent, had some fresh veggies and the meat was tasty. It was cold though, and I've always had mine hot. 

Fries were thin and kind of soggy, but I did like the cheese fries. Plenty of feta, and delicious seasonings.

Not bad, but I'll stick with Z's Greek down the road.A-ok, seems to be a fair description.  I've found a few items by chance, but for the most part, I'm not that impressed with what this location carries.   I can't imagine why someone would buy a used Tiffany necklace with someone else's initials on it, but ok...  The best part of this location is that if you hit and miss, at least you have Trader Joes and Nordstrom Rack Backroom in the same plaza so that the trip isn't wasted.I tried Salon 3121 with a Living Social deal for 6 pedicures.  It's a clean salon, uses organic products.  I have had mixed success with different nail technicians - one great, one kind of sloppy.  My biggest issue is scheduling - it is practically impossible to get a pedicure appointment in less than 3 weeks!!! It's getting to be ridiculous and I wish I was done with my Living Social deal so I can just go back to my normal salon where I can walk in and be seen in minutes.  Missing my callous removal as well... not a complete disappointment, but probably won't be coming back after my deal is up3.5 stars. I've been here a few times, but last night I was slightly impressed as the food seemed a bit better than I had remembered from previous experiences. 

The servers/hostesses in the Chinese dresses (yes, they are in the Chinese style, not Japanese - why, at a sushi restaurant?) are way tacky and gimmicky. It's not "authentic", it looks like a costume party.

The sushi we had was pretty good. I don't really have any complaints. Everything seemed fresh and well-prepared. The spicy tuna roll in particular was very tasty and perfectly spicy. As far as the service went, it was accommodating and prompt, our server was great. 

The only thing I would gripe about is the prices. They're not out of control, but they seem a bit pretentious for the overall quality of food. Zen 32 (to me) is a casual restaurant at heart. Beneath the neon color-changing pillars and pan-flute "Cherry Blossom Serenity" soundtrack, I think it is longing relax a little bit. The atmosphere is great, but can the costumey dresses, adjust the prices a bit, and stop trying to be Vegas' hippest new sushi bar, and Zen 32 could earn that 5th star.So I was here Tuesday night, the first time in a year and prior to that it had been over 7 years. This place used to be packed! Even a year ago it had a decent crowd. When we arrived.. one table was sat with a child running and screaming through the dining area. Because of that we chose the bar. 2 guys at the bar that's it. Needless to say our service was good, how can it not be right? Started with BBQ shrimp.which was realy good but not BBQ, it was more of a spicy lemon, which was fine because the server explained that. Had I expected BBQ I would have been disappointed. Garlic Bread Great..Hush puppies a little over done but still good. Followed it up with the Bourbon Chocolate Sauce sundae..um yumm. So al in all food no complaints whatsoever. Atmosphere.. there was none. We might as well have been in a one horse town. While we were there the guys left and 2 business like women took their place at the bar. What was sad was the people watching. One of the women was just short of bragging how she used to go there all the time and how she knows all the employees...went out of her way to get the bartenders name and introduce herself like she was somebody. It was sad. She was name dropping herself! Food great.. atmosphere 'nil it was depressing..Its my opinion that unless they change up their location to something with more foot traffic (Mill Avenue would be perfect for this place... other spots such as Desert Ridge, Fashion Square, Westgate even..)they're going to waste away. Town & Country Plaza just isn't what it used to be and it's sad because their food deserves the attention, it really does.I ate here last night with my folks and g/f. Having already read previous yelpers i already knew what to try and what i wanted.

The seafood gumbo was very good as was the chicken and sausage gumbo. I enjoyed a cold Turbodog along with my meal that paired fairly well with the spices from the sausage. My dad was a little disappointed that they were out of oysters for his po'boy but he claimed he was happy with the catfish po'boy in the end. Enoyed the live blues music while dining and having a good time.

All in all expect rather slow service but better than most cajun food in phoenix. Would eat here again in the future.Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  
Above average food, better service, higher than expected prices.Did you know there is live music at Baby Kays? A guy in the corner playing blues guitar. I only just noticed him on my last visit. I've been there a few times in the last few years. I thought it was a CD playing.  I had taken the music for granted without really paying attention to the sounds of fingers scratching across strings, feet tapping on the floor--the other accents that separate real from Memorex..

Maybe that's fitting. I think Baby Kay's has been taken for granted for years now. I remember when it rolled into the valley on a faddish wave of Cajun corn and blackened everything. The endurance of this one place tells you that something about it was more right than the other business that were claimed by time, recessions and the fickleness of the public.

Whatever others might say, I think this place has about the best shrimp etouffe and dirty rice you're going to find in the valley. The central location and laid-back vibe are bonuses.Check out the 1929 Steinway self playing piano. One of two in the world, the other is in the Smithsonian. The piano is valued at 28 million dollars and was willed to the Wrigley MansionMy husband and I used to frequent the Keegan's in Ahwatukee, but we have moved from that area and are slightly closer to this Camelback location. 
We ate breakfast at this location for the first time yesterday.

I found the service to be a bit slow, but our server was very polite and accomodating.

I ordered the cinnamon brioche french toast. I would go as far to say this is the best french toast I have ever eaten. It was so moist and tasty! 

I like the set up of the Ahwatukee location better. The bathrooms at this location are not as nicely kept as the 'tukee location.

I'll definitley be back for Sunday brunch again for some of that great french toast and hope to check it out for dinner some night. Keegan's usually has some good, home cooking dinner specials, so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night.So, we  had a company party here last night, and we got to bowl 2 games.  There were quite a few of us here, and overall, things went smoothly without incident.

I normally don't hang out on this side of town.  To me, its kind of an older, slightly run down part of town.  Not scary, just.....old.  I don't know how long this bowling alley has been around, but it appears probably a few years.

We had several pizza's ordered while we were there, and surprisingly, the pizzas were tasty!  Much better then the last time we were here last year.  They serve beer, and thats always a great becuase it makes bowling much more fun.

I don't know that I would personally return to this location, as I really wasnt all that impressed. Its decent, but nothing that I would return to.My boyfriend and I went strip club hopping on a Monday night. Our final stop was to Bourbon Street. $8 cover. The first thing my boyfriend said upon entering is "it's really dark in here". I thought the club was small but that was before I noticed there's a large back area with another stage. They have the yummiest free popcorn that I could not stop eating. I like the set up they have in here. The girls do one song on the back stage, then they switch to the front stage. There is a girl there with an amazing body with great muscle, her name is LaRue. I asked her if she competes and she said she's a FIGURE competitor. I told her I am on a journey to lose 135 pounds and compete in FIGURE myself. She was awesome and said for me to come back and visit her when I reach my goal. One of the things I did like is that ALL the girls had nice bodies, great boobs and nice butts. It looks like the hiring manager atleast sets a criteria for how the girls look. I've been to clubs where the majority of girls have nubs for boobs and that's just not my style. The bigger and faker the better to me. None of the girls asked us if we wanted a lap dance. I've noticed this trend amongst strip clubs. If I was a manager I'd make my girls work the floor more. My boyfriend and I ALWAYS get a lap dance if we're asked. I liked Bourbon street.Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good.Ambient - Casual dining.  Inside Retro 70s. dim lighting.

Service - Its okay.  The only fall back is that the servers only speak a little bit of english, and at times well what you get is what you get. I guess in part it adds to the authenticity of the chinese food. :-)

Food - its good.  I've had their lemon chicken, orange chicken, kung pao shrimp.  all of them pretty tasty.  I enjoy their hot tea, although if you are going to drink something else you have to let them now, because sometimes they only bring the hot tea and that is it.Sketch on outside, nice inside.

Other than being in kind of a sketch part of town, it was a pretty nice hotel in close proximity to the airport. 

My only complaint is that I never saw the manager at the manager's reception!I've only ever gone to Lindstrom to have my car washed or detailed. Used to be quick and efficient. The ticket writer talked me into a detail package that was affordable, but I wish he had set my expectations up front that if would take over 2 hours.  When I asked how much longer it would be at the desk, the cashier radioed the crew, but no one responded. Five minutes later, my car appeared up front and I drove off only to notice the half-assed job they did and my windows are streaky and smudged. I may come back for just the basic wash again, but unless I have a day to kill, I'm not opting for the extra wax or treatments -- no matter how cheap he sells it.Not bad, but for basically the same price, you can do a lot better. 

One of Ruth's signatures is that their steaks come out on a plate of sizzling butter. If that sounds a little rich and decadent, it's not...it's VERY rich and decadent. That being said if you're going to eat at Ruth's Chris, you might as well go with it. It will make you feel like crap for days, but it tastes really good.

Again, for the same money you can dine at Morton's, Donnavon's or Mastro's, all of which I think are superior, but if those places are all booked, or for some reason you just want to visit the one that was here first, Ruth's Chris is still a pretty good steak.I come to Ruth's Chris about once or twice a year. I always order a ribeye steak, and my wife orders the filet.

I love the simplicity of the steak: salt, pepper, butter, and heat. The meat is tender and juicy. However, the last couple of times I have been someone's steak hasn't been cooked quite to order. My ribeye on my last visit was cooked medium rare, instead of medium, and my wife's filet came med rare when she asked for med well. We complained about her filet, they recooked, didn't get it right again, then took it off the bill (much appreciated). My experience is that they tend to cook the meat one level below what you ask.

We ordered salads, sweet potato casserole, and creamed spinach as sides. The blue cheese dressing is outstanding, especially if you enjoy chunks of blue cheese. The sweet potato casserole was sweeter than we like; it was more dessert and side dish. The creamed spinach was mildly flavored with cream and cheese; I enjoyed it.

For dessert I received samplers of the chocolate mousse and carrot cake. The latter was my favorite; I've been craving it ever since. The mousse was a close second, and came in a chocolate cup that was just as fun to eat as the mousse.

Unfortunately, I can't give RC more than 3 stars given the service I've received (very good, but not great, esp. for an expensive restaurant), and it's a steak place, so that steak should come out perfect. It's still my favorite steak restaurant, but if I went to high end steak restaurant's more often I might try to frequent some of the others, like Donovan's and Morton's.My filet was overcooked and it's annoying when a restaurant serves your appetizers when they haven't asked to take your order and expect you to eat with menus in your way. Vodka martinis were tasty."It's been about 3 years since Ive eaten here, it's decent but I never ate anything that wowed me until last night. I ordered the veggie burger and their curry corn side. Let me start with the burger. I dont see what is so outstanding about it. It was good, it wasnt orgasmic. In fact it fell apart when I picked it up because the pattie wasnt packed very tightly, it would have been much better if ordered on it's own and not in burger form. It was a mess to eat. For veggie burgers Four Peaks is the place to go.

Now the curry corn on the other hand...sweet jesus it was good enough to request as your last meal if you become unfortunate enough to be offered one on Death Row. I was actually irritated that my friend left hers until last because after mine was all gone she had a nice untouched pile just sitting their waiting to be devoured. I was green with envy as she ate each forkful without a care in the world while I salivated.

Houstons I beg you to make this a regular dish!!!We went here late, about a half hour before close. The place was packed and the only table available was on the patio. We kind of stood around and they told us we could sit there if we wanted to. We sat down, but there were still other people waiting who apparently didn't want to sit outside. I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. 

I ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon. 

I don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.

My squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them. 

The croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.

The beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.

My girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special. 

The dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing. I could have eaten a meal of just that. 

They did bring my girlfriend a small brownie with ice cream as well, which she appreciated. 

I don't know if we would go back if this is a typical dinner experience. Maybe just get dessert to go.Some dishes are good, some taste like they came out of a can from the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.

The heaven rice rolls might be my favorite in town, and the lobster dish is fantastic (definitely agree with kate - doesn't taste like lobster, but is delicious nonetheless).

Free tea is always a really nice way to start a meal, too.I ordered the chicken combo (katsu and Hawaiian BBQ chicken).

The BBQ chicken has a pretty good flavor to it, but it was a little greasy for my taste - I think it might have been better with white meat instead of dark.  The katsu chicken wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular.  The rice was a little boring.

This was good enough that I'm not sorry I went, but I don't think it's enough to get me back.  Maybe if the price dropped a buck or two.I enjoy this place but I wish they still had my favorite dissh...I liked the island fire chicken rice bowl or the combo.  I also like the Hawaiian BBQ chicken combo with exrta veggies and extra rice with no macaroni salad.  Everyone I know loves the macaroni salad, but I have never liked any type of macaroni salad at all!  Their sauce that goes on the chicken is pretty good.  The price is decent and you get a good amount of food.  Whenever I get a combo I always have leftovers and I have it for the next day or for dinner.  This place is good for a quick bite!This is just like Filiberto's. Fast-food mexican food. It's really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. I'm a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was 2 bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed!  Next time I will get something smaller. You can't beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!I had the beef taco plate with a Mexican coke. Very good, will go back next time I am in the areaBeen coming here for years. It's the best of the fast Mexican joints by farAfter living by this restaurant for a over a year I decided to give it a try tonight.  It has been raved as a great to place to eat by a local entertainer and I figured I would give it a shot.  Service was slow through the drive thru.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the girl forgot what I ordered by the time I got to the window.   As for the quesadilla the chicken was a little dry and not nearly enough cheese.   I would prefer next time they cut the quesadilla.  I got it home and it was just folded in a Styrofoam box.   Del Taco and Taco Bell at least cut theirs.This Update APPLIES ONLY TO VOLUNTEERING at Ballet AZ.


FIVE STARS go to the dancers, directos and production crew At BALLET AZ.  They continue to do a superb job of presenting really first rate productions!  You don't want to miss the really splendid things they are doing this season!

The attitude toward volunteers at Ballet AZ has taken a turn from what it used to be.  It is being said that people who want to volunteer should be doing it because they love and want to support Ballet AZ and should expect no reward.  I personally believe that is true. Tradition, however,  has always been that the volunteers have been allowed to see the production that they are helping with at the time they working, for instance, in the gift shop.  I agree with that also.  It no longer happens when you volunteer for Ballet AZ.  You now get a voucher for a ticket to an upcoming performance or to take a dance class when you volunteer, but you can not enter the auditorium to see them dance at that time.  Having to make extra trip down there if you want to see the actual performance which many people consider a real inconvenience-parking can be expensive.  They are also limiting the number of performances you can volunteer, I understand, to once. Complimentary tickets do cost the Ballet money so I believe they are trying to limit the number that are giving out in these tough times which makes sense.  However, I have seen few volunteer groups where limiting the amount of work a volunteer is allowed to do, within reason,  is a good idea. When do you want to turn down free help? Making it clear that you can only see one performance free I would think would not be unreasonable. It'a different attitude toward the volunteers and I hope it is successful.

I will be the first to say I have not fit in with the new approach to volunteering at Ballet AZ and that portion of my life is ended.  I certainly am not saying not to check into it if you want to work with the Ballet.  I wrote my initial blurb almost a year ago. I really have considered whether it would sound like sour grapes by offering this new information.(That is not an approach I like to take if I can avoid it.) I have given out more information concerning Ballet AZ and volunteering as a result of my 1/29/2009 review. This is the only way i can think of to stay current and accurate for those who have gotten the information on a more personal basis.The Hubs and I decided to hit up Croque during a weekday work from home day based on the awesome reviews.  Though I can see the potential, I wasn't as thrilled as past reviews suggested I would be.  I can't remember the specific sandwich I got, but it was decent, just nothing special (hence why I can't remember it).  Hubs had the spicy chicken rice bowl, which was his attempt at being healthy.  It really was healthy and left him longing for something more.  It did have good flavor, but really nothing that wowed either of us.

The highlight of the trip, however, was something free, believe it or not... the freakin' chocolate chip cookie!  I consider myself a cookie connoisseur and I must say this one was awesome.  Basically, I will go back to Croque simply for that cookie... ahhh... tasty chocolaty goodness.I have ordered from here several times and think that I can offer a fair assessment of my experience. 

My favorite order is the spicy fusion ramen noodle soup and a side salad. Even when they are delivering it, they put the noodles w/ veggies and the broth in separate containers. However, no matter how many times I have plead for an extra dressing for my salad, it has been to no avail. This may be due to a malfunction between the GrubHub ordering website and the register, but alas, it just has not happened for me. The salads are delicious and fresh. The blue cheese dressing is too thin/watery. 

The bulgoki is very tasty and when I'm feeling froggy I order it for grins and giggles. I am also a fan of their philly sandwich w/ garlic dressing although I don't think it tastes anything like a philly sandwich.They close at 6 and that's that.  Don't ask for any favors.  As a loyal long time customer I got turned away right at 6.  Always great service and a great cut but after this I'm seriously considering taking my business else where.I really wanted to love this place. It came highly recommended by Yelpers and a personal friend who used to live nearby, so we were excited to check it out. Set in the Royal Palms, you walk through a lovely garden to get to the restaurant. It was raining the day we went, so we coudln't sit outside, but I'm sure it's beautiful.

We started with a couple glasses of wine, and the charcuterie plate. My bf loves cured meats, and we often order a similar appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants close to home. So we were terribly disappointed to be served a plate with only a couple slices of maybe 4 different meats, a small slice of pate, sliced pickles, a bit of mustard. That's it? For $13? The bread was served with some delicious pesto, but quite a bit of it, considering there were only 2 of us.

For entrees, bf ordered the seared scallops, and I had the short rib. His tasted fine to me, but I only had 1 bite. Halfway through the meal, he thought it smelled like BO, and couldn't finish it. Mine was ok, really nothing to write home about. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but we just were not impressed.

Service was great all the way through, thus the 3 stars. For me, the food wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular, as it should have been for the prices. Not sure what I was missing, but I just couldn't say this was a great experience.This past weekend we stayed at the Royal Palms....a beautiful place in Scottsdale.  Their restaurant certainly matched the ambience of the resort.  Dark, warm decor, rustic feel.  We were dining in a large group, so that may have knocked a star off my review, but I felt that for the level of the resort the restaurant was fair, not great.  We had the lobster bisque for starters, and it was ok....not a standout compared to others I have had.  My wife had the lobster tortellini and it was again good, not great....although the presentation was artful, it just lacked any wow factor in spicing, texture or even the basic preparation of the lobster (slightly overdone, not as succulent as it should have been).   I had the 21 day dry aged ribeye.  It was pretty good, cooked perfectly, but was a bit pricey.  The ribeye came with truffled grits and hamakua mushrooms which were ok.  There are better picks in nearby downtown Scottsdale, but if you enjoying this beautiful resort and don't feel like driving you can get a good dinner here.The atmosphere is warm and pleasant. Nice patio with heaters if it's even a little cool. Lots of plants outside and a nice fireplace in the main dining room.

The crowd tends to be on the mature side.

The service is good and friendly,  7 out of 10.

The food is pricey. The wine list is extensive,  but possibly the most overpriced. Try the $20 wine sampler - 3 half glassesof your choice. The lobster bisque was a little bitter for my taste but my petite wife loved hers and finished mine.  The $45 new york strip was ordered medium rare and came out medium, same is true for my wife's beef tenderloin. The presentation was very nice. Despite it being overcooked, it was delicious with a good medley of flavors. 

Overall,  it was good but I'd go elsewhere for the money.This particular McDonald's is actually decent. The cashiers sometimes have a hard time understanding English but usually get my order correct. And I usually only wait an average of seven minutes for my order to be ready.I would give them 3 stars because they have very helpful staff and try to answer all your issues. The problem is that their supplies are not inexpensive and they often try to sell you stuff that surmounts to really just colored water, like water clarifier. Just try to buy the basics when you go there and don't buy into the hype of all the different chemicals they will try to sell you.there's an odd dichotomy of retail paradiso and inferno going on here.  

yes, i found a really pretty linen dress for $16 and 2 casual cotton sundresses for $12 each, but it involved at least an hour of digging through piles and piles of crap that erred to extremes of "street corner hoochie mama" or "my 50 yr old mama's mama".  fantastic deals are well worth the effort but i dont recommend it if you're in a hurry.

like the previous reviewers, i found the place to be rather well organized and not the total chaos of some of the other ross stores, but my experience was somewhat soured by the language barrier between myself and the fitting room attendant.  i asked her to "please hold these for me", to which she sweetly replied "no ingles".  ok, that's cool.  i can be creative.  i put the reject items in her hand and pointed out to the floor,  "these can go back out there".  and i put my hold items on her little counter with both hands on top, "these should stay here".

so while i tried on a few more things, she sent everything back onto the floor, where i had to hunt them down again (one of which disappeared; oh little red floral sundress - why didst thou foresake me?) while sporting that damn vertical line between my furrowed brows.  

i'd be remiss if i didnt shout massive kudos for the home section - particularly the smashing deals on bedding.  i mean great brand names, high thread counts, and natural fibers.  and REALLY pretty stuff if you dig the decorative brocades and such (like i do).

points off for a shoe section that was the only chaotic mess in the store.  and can someone explain to my bigfoot ass why there's a whole section marked "11-13" and it contains almost all 10s and 3 pairs of 11s, no 12s, and no 13s?This morning I opened my fridge to a big fat empty space... and that's when I knew - time to go grocery shopping - and not just any grocery shopping - time to load up!

Sure - it's fine to go to AJ's here and there, and the Farmers Market (when in season) for fresh produce.  Sunflower and Albertson's aren't far, but for whatever reason, I chose to do my shopping today at Safeway.  

For $121, I stocked the fridge.  I won't go into the details of my purchases (grocery shopping can get really personal, you know?!) - but I will say that I came home happy.  I also am proud to say that I will be eating in all three of my meals today, and maybe snacks too.  Don't you love when you can do that?  I do!

Safeway - please work on your fresh seafood selection - there was not much there to choose from.  But other than that, I am a big fan!  I'm sure I'll see you again real soon...I have lived in Phoenix for just over a year and my fiancé surprised with a two night stay at the Royal Palms resort for my birthday this past weekend. This resort has always been at the top of my list to stay since every time we drive past it, the entrance looks incredible. I was more than thrilled when I found out we would be spending two nights there! 

Since my fiancé had to work one of the days, he invited my girlfriends to accompany me to the hotel pool. Upon arriving, the resort was as impressive as I had hoped for and we were greeted nicely by the valet service. We asked for self parking and was directed to go down to the garage located nearby. The other two cars ended up using valet but they weren't offered the self parking option and ended up tipping the valet. No big deal but the option would have been nice.

The reception area is a small room with two love seats and while intimate, it wasn't as grand as I expected. Checkin was fast but since we arrived at 9:30am I was told that we could use the pool until the room was ready and we could change in the spa. We made our way to the spa and the grounds are very beautiful. Everything is green and lush, a big contrast from the desert this time of year. There are lots of fountains and intimate seating arrangements through out the property. The spa staff was friendly but the spa did seem a bit small. The locker area was small and only two stalls with toilets and another two shower stalls. Again, this is a boutique resort though and it matched the architecture and the finishes were all nice in the area. 

The pool chairs are very comfy and have large towels that won't slip down the chair.  I was surprised to see that one of the towels on my girlfriend's chair was nearly warn through in several places. That's not something you see in a five star resort. Friendly wait staff came by within 10 minutes and gave us each a big plastic cup of lemon water. The pool is small but there were numerous chairs around the pool. The pool temperature was great and the landscaping was very nice. Something that was really disappointing was there was no music. After looking around further, I realized there aren't speakers except in the bathroom. I've never been to a resort pool without music so it was a bit... quiet. I'm all for quiet and relaxing but at times, it was TOO quite. On the second day there was a family there with their kids and it made their splashing and loud talking all the more noticeable. Also, they had three pool floaters that had definitely seen better days. I'm not sure why this resort wouldn't replace them? It seems like such a small, easy and inexpensive thing to do. Pool service was a bit sparse and several times we had to make our way to the bar to order items.  We always had to ask for everything which was unusual. Menus, towels, water....nothing seemed preemptive on their end. Additionally, the second day, the area was a mess. Towels everywhere, chairs not setup for the next guest, empty drinks on several tables. I think there was only one person working but I still wouldn't expect to see that at a resort of this caliber. There were also several ugly crows in the area that were very aggressive.  One landed on my friend as she ate her lunch and the waiter told us a story of how just the other day one dive bombed a customer and took her taco. Ummm, aren't there bird wranglers or something? 

Our room was ready by 12pm and we were in an upgraded Valencia Casita. We were way in the back of the property and were directly next to another resort. Upon entering the room, they did have a nice plate of chocolate fudge and fruit and said Happy Birthday on the plate. Unfortunately, my birthday wasn't until the next day but it was a nice gesture. 

The room was nice but it did seem a bit dark. The ceilings were low and the exposed beams on the ceiling added to the feeling. The furnishings and the bathroom finishes were nice. The tile floors added some character and it was nice having a Keurig machine in the room.  The shower had great pressure and nice tile. Our bed was comfy but it was really high off the ground so it was a definite jump to get in. The pillows were both flat, one down and one regular cotton fill. The nightly turn down service gave you two tiny water bottles on your bedside and filled the ice bucket. On our second day, we left the room at 10am and returned at 2pm and the room had yet to be cleaned. Our turndown service came around 7:30pm the second day and left a dirty plate outside our door. 

Overall, the resort is nice but that's just it. Nice. For the value and the reputation, it wasn't up to my expectations. I expected to be wowed by this place but it just never happened.Mama say mamu sa mu maku sa! Yet another "eclectic" coffee shop. Thank you 1988. Must your thrift store upholstered furniture be so soiled? Already? Ugh. Thank god I wasn't wearing a dress that day. How unseemly. Bookshelves with books. Walls with funky art. Just a few pieces however. And a large floor to ceiling scape overlooking Jiffy Lube. However, I felt the Mama Java love from the two behind the counter. Very friendly and warm. Each guest was greeted enthusiastically and seemed to get their java fix efficiently. I'm by no means a coffee expert, but this was a good cup of the liquid bean. My local coffee haunt favorites are Copper Star and Lux. This is just below that. And just out of my hood. Not a bad place. Not a great place. But, hey, don't tell Mama on me. Oh. And don't even think about talking on your cell at the counter. I hear Mama will ground you.My gal and I decided to give Mama Java's a try and I realize why I love Hava Java so much. 

Mama Java does have good coffee! If you want a good cup of Joe this could be your place. I guess I have been spoiled by HJ's service. 

Mama Java's seems to have a more sterile and less friendly feel to it. It could have just been the time we went, but I had no desire to stay and drink our coffee. The place wasn't as welcoming as our usual hangouts.

Overall the coffee was worth 4 stars, unfortunately the service and atmosphere brought it down a little for me.I was a member here for about 3 years. When I first started I was paying 126 a month. Every year the cost would go
up 7.00. After a while I had to get to my workout classes earlier and earlier because parking got to be a pain. The weight room is crowded and had to wait to use weights and machines. The last year of my membership I was paying 145 a month, too much for me. The facility is very clean. Thanks for the 3 years.Parking SUCKS.
Everything is over priced. 

It took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I wouldn't have minded the wait if someone had acknowledged my presence and given the polite "I'll be with you as soon as possible" report. Clearly, that was too much to ask for.

But if you happen to go when it's not busy (i'm not sure when this is...) I'm fairly certain the ambiance would be delightful. It's an interesting concept. Also, the spaces are WAY too tight for the type of traffic they have in there.

The gelato on the South side of the building is really bland and boring. I'd rather eat store brand ice cream. Their Pizza is really awesome, though.

Great idea - mediocre execution.Alright, I'll be honest. I've been an LGO hater for years now. As far as I was concerned it was an over-hyped, overpriced, chi chi trinket store for people with way too much money to blow on crap they don't need. Oh, and they had some food too, but not nearly as much as they did $19 candy. And who doesn't love $19 candy??

Now, all of my previous sentiments are still exactly the same. I still think it is all those things that I did before, but they have at least upped a place in my heart (stomach) due to the best freakin BLT I've ever had. For real. Their Avocado BLT is to die for. Glorious slice of bacon stacked on top of glorious slice of bacon on top of more and more bacon. For miles. And goooood bacon. Fresh avocados, tomatoes and lettuce as well to boot. Also came with a delicious slice of pineapple on the side which was one of the ripest I've had out here in a while, so kudos to that as well.

So while I don't see myself patroning the establishment on my own terribly often, next time my boss wants to spend an exorbitant amount of money on my lunch again. I'm comin' for my BLT with open arms.This target is decent. Not in the best area. It is nice and close to costco and ihop. There is also many banks and a five guys near by. 

Target is better than Walmart.I've been going to Postino for years. I would give Postino four stars, but it's a BIT pretentious now. The good? Bruschetta (the salami and pesto with a drizzle of olive oil topped off with cracked pepper is a favorite), the Mediterranean salad with prosciutto, when we lean over and chat with nervous first-date couples to break the ice, and the garage-style doors open on a perfect Spring day. The bad? Parking deserves a strong mention (they try, but it's seriously crazy), and some of the staff who think that dealing with a few snotty Arcadians all day gives them the right to be abrupt. (They probably just need to install an anti-Arcadian decompression chamber somewhere on the premises.) 

But, honestly? After a lunch or dinner of Postino-related mayhem, I get the craving for a relaxing place no one has ever heard of. Dig?Favorite spot for tasty Bruchetta!!Good food. Nice atmosphere.1 star is taken away due to the parking situation .  The food and atmosphere are good.  I've been here for brunch on the weekend when the doors are open and they have live music.  It's a good time.  It's a great place to grab a glass of wine and some bruchetta and hang out with a group of people.Having lived at the Central Postinos last year, which was my home away from home, I ventured East hoping for the same experience. Well, while it was okay, I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus" Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad, our old fave, lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK, I am exaggerating, but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new, not skilled, whatever but come on, this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it, which I know is an easy fix, but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and décor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training.***Chain Alert***
This place is a chain, but it is a decent meal.  Yes, it is slightly over priced and the food isn't the greatest.  The atmosphere is a cross between Rubios and Joe's Crab Shack and the service is compareable as well.

I ordered the Fried Whitefish Tacos (see pics) and I got a little chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Here's how the meal panned out:

The tacos were Great!  The baja sauce was not the typical white sauce.  It looked more like "Fry Sauce" (if you're from Utah) but it tasted great.  I mixed it with a tablespoon of their Red Hot Sauce.  The beans were unmashed pintos which i prefer over everything except whole black beans. They were decent nothing great I mixed in a bit of pico de gallo to flavor them up a bit. The rice was horrid.  I hate to say it, but you know those grains of rice that aren't cooked?  The hard ones that break your teeth from the outside in? Yeah. Those were randomly encountered during consumption.  Not a pleasant experience. The portions were small but I didn't complain because the tacos were actually pretty good! They were crispy and you could tell they were battered and fried to order. Surprising!

The salsa bar was mediocre.  The Red Hot sauce was more vinigarry (word?) than deliciously hot, and the Pico De Gallo was made from canned tomatoes.  The chips were so old that by the time I got to them they were broken shards of their former selves. Pity, I was looking for a good chip pig out.

The service was very good.  The first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my convenience.  When I did, another waitress took my order promptly.  The wait wasn't long, it was about 5 minutes from ordering to receiving my food.  The tables were quickly cleaned and everyone seemed happy (the customers and the employees)  It was a very comfortable and pleasant setting.

Overall, this restaurant has the 'Meh' effect.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd be back.

Constructive Criticism:
1. Add some order to the ordering process.  I was a little confused on where (and when) to order
2. Get rid of the stuffed animal order numbers.  Something about greasy food and fluffy animals says more of "bacteria" than it does "uniqueness"Cheap beer great chicken and pork. They have a great $2 menu that is avalible all week including weekends. The pork here is great and so is the chicken. I would not go with the steak. Free chips and salsa, you cant beat that and you get your own so no waiting for the busy waitress to get them for you. Great margaritas and the beer is cheap. This is a great place to go and get a good for the money meal and a drink. Try the Baja Sticks!I had waited for awhile to try this place, as it's buried in a small little shopping center and couldn't find anyone who wanted to enjoy Cuban food. I first had Cuban food at an awesome little restaurant in DC and it was amazing. This, however, was not that place. 

The summary? I enjoyed it - it was okay, but will not be going back, especially for the bill I paid. 

The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback. But it's pretty quiet inside, so I'm not sure I would really like that for a date. Also, the bathroom is outside, which is a little strange. 

I had a glass of Malbec that wasn't all that great, but I'm willing to forgive wine. The other two had cocktails which they really enjoyed - so I think I just ordered poorly.

Then we ordered 5 appetizers and two entrees to split between three people as we wanted to try all that we could. We had the plantains (they were good, but not the best I've had), then plantain chips with bean dip which was amazing! That was the best part of the meal. We ordered three more appetizers that I didn't really eat, so I can't judge them. 

I ordered the chicken with the mango sauce that came with beans and rice. For the price of the meal I was very underwhelmed. It was a really sizeable piece of chicken, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so. 

The service though was awesome though. The waiter was great and answered all of our questions and recommended great appetizers. 4 stars for the service for sure.

Again, I don't think I would go back often, but I'm glad I at least tried it out. I'm also really happy that if I want legitimate Cuban food, I'm coming back here.My husband and I had a Groupon or we likely wouldn't have tried this restaurant. I've driven past it for years and always wanted to eat there, but it's ridiculously overpriced. Even with the Groupon ($25) our bill was an additional $70!

My husband had the Emparedado Cubano, which is a Cuban sandwich which was $16 and was quite tasty, although he picked off the pickles. I just thought it tasted like a pickly ham sandwich. I had the Gallina Frita, which was excellent, but a huge amount of food for one person. The shredded chicken was succulent and rich, with caramelized onions and other flavors and the side dishes were good but not extraordinary. At least I had leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband really enjoyed his two mojitos and he's quite picky about his mojito quality. My caipirinha was just okay, as it was overly limey. We had the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer and they were excellent. 

The waiter took a very long time to greet us after we were seated and he continued to be absent for very long intervals, although he was very nice and helpful in helping me pick out a main dish to order. Overall, our meal including appetizer and dessert took slightly more than 2 hours, although the restaurant was not at all busy (when we got there, there were maybe 3 other tables seated).

I agree with others that think the decor is pretty sad. The plastic chairs seem out of place in a restaurant that asks you to pay upwards of $16 per entree.

Probably won't ever go back, unless it's for happy hour, since this place is just so expensive, but the food was quite good.I ordered the sesame chicken lunch. It came with fried rice, which was just OK. There was no eggs in the fried rice, more like color/flavored rice. The egg roll was not so great either. The flavor of the sesame chicken was good, not great! 

I agree with Gabi. The service was awesome, that is why 3 stars (2 for the food; 1 for the service).Been going there for years, my parents favorite. The food is quite good, a bit too American for me but OK. Service is good, lady owner is very friendly and she will remember you. Decor is a bit old and rooms are a bit dark, they should freshen it up a bit. Moo shu pork is my favorite, veggie dish is good, boo boo platter is OK.I still haven't found my "go-to" Chinese food place in Phoenix, but this place is pretty solid.

Came here during that weird time between lunch and dinner, and was seated with a stunning view of a dead tree in a tiny walled in area. Weird. Despite that, the service was good and the wait time was fair. Everything came out fresh.

We shared two chicken dishes and veggie chow mein, all of which I would order again. I like that they give the option to add vegetables to any dish, so I don't feel lso guilty about eating fried food in sauce.

A fine option for take-away night.As I've mentioned in many of my other reviews, I'm not a big salad person. I almost always choose a sandwich, soup or entree over a salad, even for lunch. Given that, I always appreciate a salad that has some substance to it--if there are hearty ingredients paired with the lettuce and/or there are generous portions of these mix-ins, I'm likely to be a fan (even if I'd still order a sandwich nine times out of ten!). 

The seafood cake salad I had at Taylor's definitely met my standards for a good salad. There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the salad protein is such a small portion that you have to carefully meter out enough bites to last through the whole salad. I don't know about you, but at lunch, I want to eat not think. Agree with other reviewers that the salads at Taylor's are pricey but this is logical given their size. 

One thing I was really unenthusiastic about at Taylor's? The incredibly chilly and relatively unattentive service. I don't need a bubbly server who is constantly in my face or spewing out niceties, but I wouldn't mind someone who at least pretends to give a rat's ass about the job (or if they can't muster that, at least gets me what I need when I need it). 

If you want a big and tasty salad, check out Taylor's--but don't go expecting friendly service.I have been able to experience both lunch and breakfast at Taylor's Cafe and on both occasions, both service and food were decent. The restaurant is tucked between some small clothing shops, The Eggery, and next to AJ's. The parking is not desirable especially during the lunch hour as the restaurant is sharing the lot with three restaurants and the grocery store.

The restaurant is small with few small tables, shared booth seating, and some outdoor seating. The decor is bright with exaggerated art work of Jazz performers. Apparently, the restaurant used to have some live Jazz music in the past. It is a very cute place.

For lunch, I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good. However, I thought the options for breakfast were better. You could either choose one of the specialty omelets or build your own. I had the lox omelet which was excellent with hash browns. I was interested in the country potatoes however the waiter had mentioned that other tables had sent back the potatoes and that the hash browns would be better. Still unsure, he let us sample the country potatoes which were decent. I actually liked the country potatoes over the hash browns, I thought it was nice that the server was interested in making sure that we were satisfied. And overall, we all were. My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented. The server was open to providing separate checks (however I am not sure that he would have been so willing if the place was packed which it wasn't). There was a random To-go iced tea delivered to our table and our check had originally not charged for our coffees but then after separation, had charged. These few incidents of confusion were masked by the overall pleasant service, atmosphere and quality of the food. I will definitely be back and would recommend Taylor's as a great breakfast/brunch location.Sure, it was a school night - but the place was deserted. Well, apart from the few people taking up the bar games... though they all did clear out by midnight. The bar location didn't seem like it would really draw people in on that alone. Think: East Phoenix 70s mini-strip-mall...

The bartender went to my high school and had been in the valley forever. The vibe in the place was very old-school local. Valley natives would feel at home I imagine. The location probably has a bit to do with that. 

Before everyone cleared out, I joined in a chat with some of the regulars - they were quite friendly and I would feel quite comfortable going back based on that. Smart, young, and good-looking... also hip and down to earth. Pretty refreshing, really. 

The drinks were quite strong... plan a designated driver or an alternative method home if you're going to drink. The atmosphere was 'dirty old dive bar,' but I've definitely been in much worse. I'd say it's on the clean end of that description. However...

I went into the men's room to take a piss and someone had splattered their own shit onto the wall of the tiny bathroom. It was a big splat about waist high, streaks going from splat to floor where there was a big shit pile. What kind of person throws their shit on the wall? I mean, seriously...

I took a picture with my phone and pissed and then left it as it was. I told the bartender about it and she seemed to immediately know who had done it. I mean, if you know a person is capable of shitting on a wall - don't fucking let them into your bar... duh. She said she wasn't going to clean it and said I could use the ladies room (which I did the second time I had to piss). I guess I don't blame her not wanting to clean it... it was gross. 

Not too gross to take a picture of though - should I submit it to the photos of this place on here?

I guess apart from the shit and the location, this place is okay for a local dive. It's punk-friendly and has plenty of bar games (pool, darts, etc...). It's similar to TT Roadhouse, but with only half the character - also a little more space and fewer customers.I rarely do fast food, but every now and then, I find it convenient, cheap, and oh so appealing, especially when fast food drive-thru windows exist!

So, on a recent Sunday, upon realizing that I had two hungry kids in the car and nothing too appealing at the house to eat, I made my way toward El Pollo Loco, entered the drive-thru, and within 10 minutes, was headed home with a feast for all!

I ordered a salad for myself, some chicken nuggets and sides of mac and cheese, corn, broccoli, and french fries for the kids.  However, I arrived home to find that they forgot to include the broccoli.  Bummer.

I liked my salad and the kids liked the nuggets and fries.  The other stuff, not so much, but there's always something that doesn't get eaten at my house with 2 little ones that are hit and miss picky eaters.  

I noticed El Pollo Loco offers some family style meals and everything is moderately priced, so I may just return again soon to try more from the menu.This is a pretty good place. My wife has been going to this place for years, and knows the owners and waiters quite well. Its her favorite place in AZ thus far. The food has always been consistent as well as the service. Some of the waiters have been there as long as the place has been opened. Once you have been there a few times, and they get to know you it turns out to be a fun place to go.I went here Wednesday night to celebrate my birthday with my mom. I had been here before, I went here with my whole family about 5-6 years ago, and, though the food was good, we were a bit upset that they charged us per slice of cake we cut from a cake that we brought....pretty not cool. Anyway, I don't know if they do that anymore, but it was really not cool. So back to the present, the restaurant is very cute and our table faced some bay windows that was pretty nice. Our waiter was a bit snippy at first, for example, my mom asked for bread while we were deciding what we wanted and he said 'I'll bring bread AFTER you order'...how weird is that? It's not like we set this whole fake birthday dinner (with reservations) to smuggle some free bread....Anyway, we ordered and he brought some bread that was warm and tasty, with a crunchy crust and a soft middle. We started with a salad that was fresh and light. I ordered the gnocchi in the cream sauce and my mom ordered the chicken marsala and we split. They were both delicious! The gnocchi was light and the sauce was flavorful, but it was extremely rich...had to take half home. The chicken marsala had a wonderful sauce...you could really taste the wine in there. My one problem with it is that everything is a la carte, so no pasta or anything to eat with the chicken. Despite that, it was tasty, so I can forgive that I suppose. They brought out a slice of cake for me at the end...not sure what is was...it was almost like a tiramisu but with a rum flavor and white chocolate chips on top....it was really tasty, but I wish they would have brought the dessert tray around so I could have chosen....however, they did give us the cake for free so I really can't complain. 

Final word: I would come back here for the delicious food, but don't expect awesome service. 


PS one of the waiters reeked of smoke, like so much you could taste it when he walked by....that's not so cool. If people want to smoke, that's their prerogative and I don't care, but maybe smoke in the open air so the smell doesn't stick as much....just a thought.I dropped in to Cookies in Bloom to see if I could satisfy a sugar craving for one, without having to buy a full bouquet.  The gentleman behind to counter was quick to oblige, pointing out they also had candy apples and gelato, in addition to cookies.  The cookie, itself, was large, though somewhat dense and dry; the icing VERY sweet.  Glancing at the bouquets on display, they seem to do a lovely job of decorating and packaging (and they ship, too!). I don't think I'd buy again, solely for the purpose of eating a cookie, but they can be pretty "show-y" in bouquet format.  If you care to take a moment to sit, the sidewalk has a couple of cafe tables.  No extra charge for the live music drifting across the street from The Vig.  ;)Chicago dog was awesome! Everything else not so good. Chili cheese fries sucked, slider sucked. Restaurant was dirty. I probably won't be back again.This place is A-Ok...hence the 3 stars.  Not my favorite but not something to avoid either.  The sliders were tasty when ordered with everything on it.  They were larger then I expected.  The chili dog was decent.  The chili was a bit sweeter then I would have liked.  The fries were also decent.  One of the let downs- no Chicago dog...that's right no Chicago dog on the menu of a Chicago hamburger joint with floor to ceiling Chicago memorabilia.  They had a whole list of other hot dogs so it was bit of a let down.  The place felt a little dusty but I think they meant for it to feel like an old diner.  The customer service was excellent and I think I would be open to trying a few other items on the menu.  I would return just not too often.Just popped at 6:30pm in to try a couple of those Windy City Sliders at $1.04 each. They made them well done for me and it only took about 5 minutes to get them and 5 more minutes to eat them. I guess I was expecting more of the White castle experience (my fav burger chain) since that chain started in the Midwest, but these were good, but just run of the mill burgers. White Castle steams everything including buns, but Windy City doesn't. The buns are regular and the burger just comes off grill with the additions of pickles and onions and ketchup (no mustard for me). Nothing wrong with these sliders at all, but don't expect anything like the castle legend. Place itself was loaded with old Chicago sports posters, but seemed like a makeover might be needed or is that the charm of the place I suppose.Convenient - close to the house and easy. This was my first time here and it was eh. I got the beef and broccoli - I know, not a traditional Thai dish by any means, but I was in the mood. The sauce was good and the broccoli was cooked well but the meat was too thin, dry, bland but managed to taste weird. I ate everything but the meat and was still full so not a total loss. My boyfriend got the pad Thai and it was also only ok.

I don't think I would return here, but I also don't want to judge it on a one time trip.Picked up food.  Had to wait a little too long for it to be ready despite calling ahead.

Food itself was decent.  Had beef in red curry w green beans.  Wanted it Thai hot--it came kind of medium.  Good flavors but not enough heat and way way more beans than meat.  Also had a shrimp over lettuce app.  Liked the lemon grass flavors but the lettuce tended to get too soggy w all the sauce.

Tasted my friends coconut chicken soup.  Good size portion but the flavors -- while good -- we're not as crisp and coconutty as I am used too.  

I didn't see any Thai basil dishes...maybe it's an ATL v PHX Thai thing??

When I'm back in town will check out some other places.This certainly wasn't the worst Mexican food I have eaten, but it wasn't the best.  One reviewer claimed the salsa was tomato sauce with chili powder.  It wasn't.  It had a mild flavor with a slight tang of spicy.  It was on par with Pace Picante.  I had the Cominbation #2 with a shreaded beef taco, tamale, and cheese enchilada with rice and beans on the side.  The sauce on the tamale was my least favorite.  The taco was good but nothing to ooh and aah about.  The enchilada was a flat pancake of cheese and tortilla, but it was tasty none the less.  The beans and rice were not on par with my local Mexican joint in San Diego.  The $3 margarita was enjoyable and worth the money.  I have had worse and paid a lot more.  Over all it was an average joint.  But the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but there are a lot of other Mexican places to try before I return.popped in for lunch and beer today. Had the special, BBQ Beef w/ fries and Cole slaw. It was okay. The slaw was actually better than many places it had flavor beyond just mayo. The half pitcher of beer was cold. The bartender/waitress was friendly and had a sense of humor. The jukebox was playing and it was pumping out a great selection of classic rock hits. The place is pretty big. The bathroom is tiny and somewhat dingy. There must be 20 TVs there to watch. They have karaoke one night a week and have pretty good size stage/floor for that. They have a daily special and offer their cheap raved about breakfasts meals until 2pm daily. Half price on some appetizers as of 3pm and discount drinks. Place is a bit dark but clean. There is one pool table and two arcade games. It seems to me that it must be a serious drinking place because it doesn't offer much to do in the amount of space that is there. Oh and there is plenty of bar space to belly up to, the bar is huge! The menu is so-so , nothing fancy or extensive but one should find something on it, with most things under $9. I suspect I will eventually pop in again to try the raved about breakfast menu.The working man's breakfast hole that has been feeding locals cheaply  since long before many of us could identify Phoenix on the map.  If I was ever a location scout and needed a seedy local dive bar from which my main characters could procure a map from an unkempt local in order to launch their adventure i would start here.Ok, so I only went in with very minor fixes (link removal and battery).  I turned to yelp for reviews, and this place is literally 5 minutes away from me.  The guy is nice enough, and it wasn't busy.  Inexpensive, just as others had posted-$5 battery (great price) and $5 for link removal (meh..)

Before you go: have cash.  He takes cash only!This place has pretty good. Food was fresh and the service was good. Just not the best chinese food I have had in phoenix.I went here for Valentine's day and it was a good restaurant but not great if you want to compare it to some of the top restaurants in town.  The appetizers and entrees are good.  I would recommend the pastas since they are fresh and handmade.  The service and atmosphere were nice but for what I'm paying I could think of a few other restaurants that I would have better overall experiences at.Decent food that was just down the street from the hotel where I was staying. I got the ravioli entree and it came with garlic bread and salad. They could afford to spruce up the house salad a little bit, but the raviolis were tender and pretty good, even if the sauce left something to be desired.

Attentive service and plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.Pretty decent quick breakfast or lunch for the working crowd.  It is located in the ground floor of an office building and open weekdays only.  Very casual and service is at the counter - they call your name when yours is ready.  Nothing is fabulous, but everything I've had (which is a big selection because I work nearby) is at least palatable, which is loads above most office park cantinas.  They serve Starbuck's coffee all day.  They do not have a grill, so everything hot is from a sandwich press, boiled, or from what looks like a mini deep fryer.  To their credit, they seldom try items that are only good grilled (hamburgers), and do a decent job with the equipment they have.  
Lines can be long, with waits up to 15 minutes between 11:45 - 12:15, so time your visit accordingly.This place is nothing special.  The food was good, but not great.  The service was fast and friendly, but again the food was nothing worth going back for.  I don't even remember what it is that I ate, so that in itself should tell you something about the place.  Or does that tell you something about me?  Yes, I am getting old, but I can remember when something is worth having again!Oh my, dare I...yes, I'm going to have to go with 3 stars.  Normally I would shun, poo-poo, and dismiss a gringo-Mex place like Carlos O'Brien's, but I got thinking that for what it is (gringo-Mex)... it's pretty darn OK!  Last night's meal of grilled shrimp and vegetables clinched it. The tacos are pretty good, the chimis, the burritos...and to find a decent, light ,healthy option too (I gotta go healthy once and a while, just not too often), well that's special.Pretty decent Mexican food joint with an OK atmosphere and good service.  I always make the mistake of asking for like 3 refills of chips/salsa and never having enough room for my dinner! DOH!  Anyways, I asked the server about the Irish/Mexican restaurant name and he went into this 20 minute awkward explanation about the owners and stuff, so don't do that if you go.  The food didn't knock my socks off, but it was ok and it came out quickly.We used to go here years ago. Been going to ajo als and Arriba's since. They are just closer to where we live.
I ordered the pollo fundido, which is what I order at the other places. It was drier and not as tasty as I've gotten used to. Still a good dish but it'll probably be years before I go back again.
The service was awesome. The guy who brings the chips and salsa and refills the drinks- totally awesome. My drink was never below 1/2- I love that. We tipped him separate...I went to this place several times for drinks, lunch and happy hours and I think it is more for the atmosphere.  Their decor is fun and their Happy Hour is nice because they have a free chips / salsa bar available.  

Last night, I ordered a Blue Moon I think it was 22oz for 6.50 and a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada for about 6.95 (off of the a la carte menu)  and sat watching 2 baseball games with my hubby.  There were a few people at first around 5pm and the service was pretty fast, but as more and more groups started showing up the service was slower because it was just the two of us and the waitress had to deal with about 2 / 3 groups of 4 - 8.

I totally understand being busy, especially when our food came out fairly quick in the beginning, but the meal itself was ok.  I think it is a fun place to be and their chips and salsa are good, but for food I think you will just be stuck with an ok.We went here while visiting our son and grandson in Phoenix

I cant say that I was too impressed with the meal. I got a beef tamale and 2 beef enchiladas which were OK but far from anything special. The Fiedo was pretty tasty and we both thought that the chips and salsa were good, especially the flour ones.

Will we go back, possibly during happy hour for the free buffet and because the chips and salsa here are very tasty.I had expected more greatness from this place. The salsa was good, service good, atmosphere ok. I was a lone diner, and they sat me back in a dark corner. I had brought a book to read while eating, but couldn't even see the pages. 
The best part of the menu was the ceviche. If a restaurant has ceviche, you know the food is good. I cannot resist raw seafood.
 The tortilla soup was ok, and the chips and salsa was above average. The chips were REALLY good actually. 
The bloody maria (tequila rather than vodka) was also average, nothing special. Heck, it was even on special and the waitress charged me full price.
With all the advertising saying this was the best mexican place around, I expected alot better.This has one of the best patios in Phoenix. If you're looking for a place to have a margarita, people watch, and enjoy awesome weather, this is the place to be. I love the food.  I personally can do without the flour tortilla chips; I'll usually dig through to get to the corn ones! The salsa rocks and I've always had good service.  A Phoenix must-visit IMHO.Really liked the food. The fiancee's sis got some sort of veggie fajitas...I'll DEF get that the next time I go back. Not much else to say, it was a mexican restaurant. They are so numerous in Phoenix, it's hard to be super impressed. I'd definitely go back though. Everything on the menu looked tasty!Busy location. Clean and modern interior, same average staff as other locations.Nice little coffee shop. They have their own roaster, which is a big plus.

They have a nice large table, for setting up a laptop or whatnot.

They have ample outdoor seating, which is always a big bonus!

They tend to close on the early side; 7-8 PM, which, for a coffee shop is kinda weird.

They have delicious blended and iced drinks, as well as their hot drinks. They have a selection of bulk beans, but I have not tried any of them as of yet.

The Sunnyslope Art Walk happens in this shopping center, so that could be your opportunity to stop in and check them out.While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. 

Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his "wild mushroom" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so "wild" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.

The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.

Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?I'm wavering between a 3 and 4 star review here. On food alone? 3 stars. I ate the breakfast buffet one morning and had the fruit plate another morning. As far as breakfast options go, this is really your only choice when staying at the hotel other than room service. The breakfast buffet was limited and not that fresh. 

The omlette bar was tasty and worth it, but that was about it. (I mean...they had oatmeal--a breakfast staple in a hotel buffet--but it was pretty much a congealed block.)

The thing that makes me tempted to give 4 stars? Well, both times we ate here the server asked us if we wanted an additional coffee in a to-go cup on our way out. Okay, that may seem like a little thing--but it's *such* a nice and thoughtful touch. 

Aside from that it was utterly mediocre. It's NOT *bad* food or anything--just meh.This place is good if you are staying at the resort and need a meal.  On its own it is not a destination to seek out.  That said if you are there and want breakfast get the Arizona Eggs. They are poached eggs with chorizo, black beans, cumin and other spices served on top of a fried native American flat bread.  They are heaven!!!I was excited by the view and the outdoor seating.  I sat down, was handed a menu and nearly fell off my chair after looking at the price of everything on the menu.  I am from SF so to come to Phoenix and see prices higher than many of the fantastic restaurants in SF was a bit of shock.  Once I got past the $39 dollars for chicken I decided to enjoy whatever.  I started with the caprese salad.  This is a dish that is good in its simplicity, however, it was prepared with jelly that tasted like a key lime pie.  I was not thrilled by this dish.  This was all saved when the entree arrived.  I had diver scallops with lobster on a pumpkin cornbread piece with some vegetables.  I cannot explain how rich and beautifully done this was.  The scallops were the highlight.  I was a bit disappointed in the lobster(a little tough), but the flavor was just fantastic.  My husband had the ahi, which was also really well done.  It was plated with baby squash sandwiches stuffed with blue crab.  It was really great.  
I want to give more stars because I did enjoy the food and the service, however, the price was not justified.  If you are going to charge starting price of $40 an entree, there have got to be little to no complaints. Great scallops though!We were in the lounge on Friday. What a beautiful room and patio. Service was not impressive at all. Our server paid very little attention to us and lacked any kind of professionalism or personality. While we were all chatting and visiting with an out of town guest she came over, interrupted us by saying, "so, you ready for the check?" clearly she was done with us.I really want this place to be more than exceptional but after the second visit (months after the first) I can only say this:  you pay too much for the view.
The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line, it is an overly expensive resort restaurant with OK food and exhorbitant prices.Great location, great view and good food. The customer service is top notch too.I was introduced to MPRC in lieu of my company's annual Christmas party. Location is tucked aside a mountain with a view of the city but not exactly in the best of surrounding neighborhoods. We were here during the day so we didn't get those twinkling night time views, which I can imagine are just fabulous! The reception space is outdated but large, especially the outside patio. Buffet food was chicken, prime rib, pasta salad, salad, veggies, mashed potatoes and a roll. The food was fine, just your average banquet hall food. I think for this occasion, the space worked but thinking of it as a reception for a wedding, I wouldn't even go there unless you don't care what your reception space looks like and/or are on a tight budget. There's really nothing special about the space except for the views. Next!Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Norm R.  I had a Carne Asada Torta ($6.00) & a small Carnitas soft taco ($1.25).  The food was quite good & the prices ok but the restaurant itself & the service were weird.  I felt that for this type of place, it was no match at all for Tacos Atoyac.     :-|

(Cash only.)I was actually let down after stopping into the new location (I remember their old store having way more of a selection of gear overall). It seemed empty, and they didn't even have a book section which I was looking forward to checking out. Heads up...they don't carry any mountain bike gear either. The 3 things I was looking at buying they didn't have (nikwax down wash being one, which shocked the hell out of me because they sell some good bags). The majority of their small items are locked up behind the counter or under glass, which I thought was a little strange (you can't get hands on and play with things). If you are shopping a bag, climbing gear, a pack, or kayaking gear, you'll find a wide range of items. I'd personally go elsewhere for footwear. To leave on a positive note, they have rentals available, and the service was great!PRICEY! thats all! :-) Staff is very friendly but holy shit are they expensive!This place is a great dive bar. We love the drink prices and the people here are laid back and cool. (no need to worry about any fights that I could tell) Highly recommend if you like dive bars. Also they have pool tables and darts.Hooray for another bar I can stumble home from!
 Finally ventured in after nearly two years of living in the neighborhood. My already half-drunk, starving cohorts and I were very impressed with the extensive menu..Chicken Fried Steak? Yes Please. Chicken Fried Chicken? Yes please. I strongly support anything fried anything. And believe you me, that's what you will get when you come here. So dieters may want to stay away. 
Service was friendly, not the fastest. The poor guy seemed like he had to wait on the entire bar area so I could hardly get angry with him. 
Price seemed a little high-I guess that's what you get for ordering margaritas at a sport's bar. And a completely needless enormous sampler appetizer of fried goodies to share along with your fried entrees. 
A good neighborhood hangout, I will be back to continue my assault on my digestive track.Food was great I would've given 5 stars but I got charged for 2 extra dressings & both were wrong. Also when I specifically ordered chx wings for my kids "these are for my kids" he could've told me that mild is still a little spicy. My spicy wings were great. Delivered to my hilton squaw peak room, no napkins, condiments or cutlery - whaaaat?  This wasn't dirt cheap & altho very tasty, a few pts off for customer service issues.The food is ok, a bit greasy but most Chinese food is now-a-days. The staff is really nice and they will cook to order off the menu if you ask.If you find yourself craving Chinese food and happen to be in the Moon Valley area at the time, this is a decent place to satisfy that craving. It's Americanized Chinese food, of course, as you would probably guess when you enter and note the old-time Chinese restaurant decor. But the dishes are nicely prepared, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed.This is a really, really generic neighborhood sports bar. They have generic bar food, generic drinks, and generic drink specials. They have poker nights several nights a week that bring out... well, just the kind of crowd you expect at a neighborhood sports bar poker night.

The only reason I'm taking the effort to write this review is to mention their hot wings. They used to have an "atomic" wing challenge, where you would sign a liability waiver then have to eat a dozen extremely hot wings. If you could eat all of them you would receive a shirt and your picture on the wall. Last time I was in Sports Peppers all of the pictures were off the wall and the atomic wing challenge was gone, but I believe their hottest wings are still just as spicy.

Since the wings still exist and I did their old atomic wing challenge, let me explain to you how hot the wings were for anyone crazy like me who wants to test their manhood. Let me say beforehand that I can eat a ton of spicy foods. Suicide wings at most every place around town are not a problem to eat. They are enjoyable and do not resemble a challenge or anything too spicy. I figured this "challenge" would be easy. It was not.

When the plate arrived, the fumes launched a barbaric attack on my nose. I cringed knowing what I might be in for. But hey, any loser cook can make wings smell hot. Actually making them hot is something different. I took the first bite. No sweat. I made a sarcastic remark to my friends, thinking about how awesome I am, probably something along the lines of, "This shit is a joke. Too easy." Well, like most really hot foods, these wings take awhile before they really hit you. When they do hit, have some fucking milk nearby. 

Sooner or later I finished all of the wings. I was victorious. Except for a couple of things. First of all, my mouth was numb. I drooled on myself a couple of times. My eyes were watering. When I got home, I lived in the bathroom for awhile and produced some utterly vile waste. To be honest, I don't think I ate wings for ~6 months after this challenge. This little sports bar taught me that I'm not the spicy food god I thought I was. You win, Sports Peppers.

Oh, to the guy who looks like Jesus and had the 1st place record for eating some absurd amount of these (100 maybe?): bravo, sir.Don't come here looking for knowledge.  I find it to be spotty at best. And I'd prefer not to buy Duralast parts - but sometimes they have the only one of something I need and I go.

It's not bad for little pine trees and floor mats but don't expect to discuss the merits of ceramic vs metallic brakes with anybody in there.  they don't have a clue.If you have to eat fast food - do it in style. The nicest Wendy's I've ever seen in my life. No one goes to a fast food restaurant for the quality food. It's clean , modern and has a cool soda machine.I sit here writing this from the waiting room at approximately 3:15 pm, while I wait to speak with the only home loan person for BoA in the area. My appointment was at 3:00. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal, but when I got here my customary 5-10 minutes early, I just so happened to sit next to the guy ahead of me, whose appointment was at 2:00. That's about 55 minutes late for those trying to keep up with all the numbers.

A few minutes ago, roughly 3:05, I was acknowledged and told she was running "a little behind." The acknowledgement was appreciated and saved a 2-star rating.  Knowing he was an hour past his appointment, I asked for a guess at how long it would be, to which I was assured "about 30 minutes."   He was finally called back shortly after that, and I continue to wait.

I've been with Bank of America for somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years or more.  I like the bank, and the people at this location and most of the ones I dealt with in Florida are friendly.  However, I can't help but feel it's not too much to ask for a simple phone call to let someone know when you're running 30-60 minutes behind. 

While the company as a whole I would rate 4 stars, this branch doesn't quite make that level, and hence the 3-star rating.  Before you think me to picky based on a single experience, I'd like to note I've been irritated here before.  In addition to the time issues I experienced today, I've also found certain others at this location to be a little pushy when it comes to Bank offered services (credit cards, retirement plans, etc). I realize this is probably a system thing and not a location thing, but it hasn't been like this at other branches.

I'm finishing this up, now the 30 minutes later I was told, and eagerly await my turn so I can finish up and enjoy the rest of my day off. Fortunately they seems to be wrapping up.  I may update further at a later time pending the outcome here.The food is good (except the beef and broccoli - which was bland). The BBQ pork is very yummy! So is the chow mein, orange chicken, and mongolian beef. It only gets 3 stars from me because they don't have the option for combos. When I go to a chinese restuarant I want a plate with like 3 things that I like on it. But this is not an option here. Which is sad, because I LOVE ALMOND CHICKEN, and my husband HATES it. So I never get almond chicken because you have to share all the food. Each dish is a large plate that you share among the table. If they would let me make a combo, they'd get at least 4 stars from me.This was one very clean location (down to the bathrooms). Although it was packed because it was a Saturday ( what can you expect lol) the staff still managed to keep things clean. No cups, plates, etc lingering, and no tables full of garbage. Why am I focusing on that? Because another Peter Piper location failed miserably in that area and I wanted to give this location kuddos for being clean, tidy, and just a-ok.  Oh how was the pizza you ask.? Eh I have had better but it was ok as well. Will I be back? Yep as my fiance's niece likes this place so we will be back soon.Nice atmosphere, decent foodFood was ok. It was the server's second day so she struggled, but tried her best. The biggest issue was the manager. I asked for a gluten free menu and he told me that he would have to go print one out and would take him a few minutes. He wasn't happy that he had to go to the extra trouble. I am GF because of an allergy but how about not making a big deal out of it. If your menu says it's available on request, it shouldn't be a big shock to you. 

Food ok. Service ok. Customer service was lacking.Nice Place friendly staff!I love AJ's, but this one, at 7th and Thunderbird, is far inferior to the Central and Camelback AJ's. Not crazy about the staff here, and it just doesn't have as much cool Whole Foodsy stuff as the midtown location. The salad bar BEYOND BLOWS, too. It's basically the worst salad bar in the history of salad bars. It's a "gee, thanks for throwing us salad-eaters a bone with the mixed greens AND the iceberg. How kind." salad bar. It's a "why bother with the big salad box? You can fit everything they feature in the small one" salad bar. It's a "$8.99/lb?! What the?" salad bar.

The wine guys here are always pretty cool and helpful though.Just like any gym, this location has its perks and its irks. I recently moved (my old gym was the one on 83rd/Union Hills, nice location but lacking some things), and this is now the closest location to me, so here I am. 

WEIGHTLIFTING AREA:
When you first walk in...the weights area stinks. Literally. It smells because there is hardly any airflow. Yes, they have ceiling fans, but you can stand under them and not even feel it. Once your nose acclimates to the smell, it's not so bad. My old LA did not have this smell issue, nor does the one on Camelback/7th. Definitely not something I'm excited about. Also, lack of airflow means you are going to sweat a lot more here than you would if the air wasn't so hot and stagnant. Also, it seems like there is an abundance of creeper dudes and a lot of people doing weird/atypical sh*t here...not sure what that's about. 

This location has a LOT of equipment, but they are often busy (parking lot is often packed), so it makes sense. They have a mix of some old and some newer machines, e.g., they have some old...and I mean f***ing DINOSAUR leg curl machines. 

They have not two but THREE squat racks, my god could you ask for more? They also have several cages, so if you want to squat/deadlift, and some douchey bro is curling in the squat rack, amazingly, you have options. There are lots of wires too, so you don't always have to wait for some dude occupying two wires doing a 30 minute superset on chest.  They are missing a couple things I'd like them to have, such as a wide grip hammer strength chest, but they do have decline, flat and incline hammer strength. They also have a T-bar, which is something that not every location has, so that's cool. 

They have a lot of free weights, so you're not always having to wait for someone using the dumbells you want to use. 

CARDIO: 
This place has a sh**ton of cardio machines, yet every single machine (besides the handbikes, but really, who uses those besides that creepy guy with the long hair?) have those darned TVs on them. I must be the only person in the world who prefers to do cardio WITHOUT a monitor 12 inches in front of my face. I much prefer the machines without the integrated TVs, but I digress. When I am not running for cardio, I like to use the stairs, but I'm not a fan of the stairs they have here. They seem to be an older model with more narrow steps that are just a little too hazardous for my liking. They also have a pool, racquetball court, studio, spin, basketball court- but all that crap I never use. 

TL;DR:
This location is fine. It has what I need for lifting, it's just stinky and hot, and I never want to do cardio here.Most of the staff are friendly and helpful and the store offers a lot of different services, including key cutting, mailbox rentals, and photo-copying, though it is a very small shop.

I have a mailbox here and fairly consistently get mail that's supposed to go to an adjacent box.  When I report it, they always say they'll ask the distributor to be more careful, but I can't say I've noticed much change.  I wonder how much mail of mine has gone to another box?

The main complaint I have relates to the cost of mail services.  GASP!!  Holy crap!!!  Be prepared to pay a premium.  They are overpriced, as also noted by several other reviewers.

TIP: For US Postal Service in the same shopping center, visit the Hallmark Store to the west.  They store itself has the worst service ever (see my review), but they have an in-store postal branch outlet...at least for now.  That may change when the USPS goes belly-up...Since I have plenty of furniture, but needed a few accessories, we took the long trek to north PHX.  The store has an interesting selection of model home accessories, model home furniture, and other upholstery and case goods that appear to be either used or possibly from model homes.    I was hoping for more model home linens, and while they did have some, the colors and style weren't what I was looking for (not their fault).  Definitely worth a stop if looking for furnishings or accessories.  They had unique pieces that could definitely be a conversation starter and many quality pieces that would last much longer than furniture found in lower-end furniture stores that are so prevalent throughout the valley.Nothing fancy here but the price is right: $17 for a pedicure and plenty of polish colors to choose from.It had fallen off my radar a bit, but I came for dinner earlier this week. Got the pasta with clams. Holy Moley! I've never seen so many tiny little clams! ($21 - See the photo!) 

Four in the shell and countless baby clams complimented by leeks and garlic.

By the time I had finished the pasta, there was still a bed of clams on my plate! I got a to go container for the little buggers and figure I'll add them to some sauce and pasta at home for round 2!

Entrees come with salad and bread.

Salute means cheers and, lucky for us, they have some delicious wines to say it with!Cozy, romantic little neighborhood Italian joint.

Food was pretty good. My husband had the meat lasagna which he said was decent. I had the gnocchi which was tender and tasty with an okay vodka sauce.

Didn't care for the bread that came out first, nor for the house salad.

My dirty martini was spot on and a good price even with premium vodka.

Service was mixed. The bussers were on top of it with filling the water and bread. I felt our server was a bit cold towards us however. Not rude or mean but a bit impatient and unfriendly. Was it the restaurant.com certificate? It's a shame that I feel compelled to tell servers that we tip well over 20% of the original bill. I shouldn't have to. 

We may or may not be back. Food was good but there are many other delicious Italian options to commit to it.Went in for dinner tonight with 2 others. The place was fairly empty. We ordered coffee since we don't drink wine, though there aren't many Italian wines on the menu.The coffee was lukewarm and didn't taste fresh. They put it in a carafe and warm in a microwave. Ugh. The menu is limited to some nice choices that are higher quality than chain Italian restaurants. They serve a basket of average garlic bread. We opted for 3 different plates (Ravioli, Manicotti, & Linguini w/ white clam sauce) & we ordered the mushrooms for an appetizer. They didn't bring appetizer plates so we used our bread plates. Then they sat dirty thru the entire meal. The food is good not fantastic 5-star but tasted good and the presentation was nice except the soup was served in a small cup with no under plate or saucer. 2 of us opted for the salad which was simple and came already with the house dressing. The service was only so-so. We were checked on regularly and the busboy filled our water regularly but we had to ask for a refill of bread and coffee. We had dessert of creme brûlée and had to ask for 3 spoons. Then he brought a tiramisu by mistake and had to take it back and bring the creme brûlée. Fortunately, we had a coupon for reduced price because the final tally was way overpriced at over $80 including tip. Atmosphere is quiet and pleasant. It's definitely not an elegant restaurant. Ambiance is romantic or intimate and the patio filled up fast (misters are available). Music is soft vintage pop (Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald). Overall we give 3 stars because they charge high end prices for less than high end quality.Went here one night for take out after going to zumba across the street.  The tom yum was delicious and spicy.  The thai beef salad puzzled me because it had all the cooked part at the bottom and had iceberg lettuce on top.  That was probably a good idea to make it travel, but not a fan of the iceberg.  And when I got back to my hotel room and had no utensils I was annoyed, but the soup was good enough to sip from the cup.  I will probably try it again and skip the salad.The food wasn't as jaw dropping as one might expect from other reviews. It was average, but not bad. The staff was friendly but I wouldn't want to dine in so we got your food to go.They are now closed.Ordered the orange chicken lunch special and hot & sour soup for takeout (note: I guess soup is not included with the lunch special if you get it for takeout, so I ordered it separately). I had to ask for the soup again because it wasn't packed in my bag when I arrived. I really liked both items, especially the soup, and the fried rice side is flavorful. I'm not a huge egg roll fan, but this one was pretty good. I wish the soup came in smaller sizes- 32 oz is a bit much for me, but hey, leftovers! No napkins or utensils were packed with my takeout which was odd, and inconvenient since I was going somewhere without silverware, but I found a spoon and managed! A few hang ups but overall I enjoyed the food- I will return.It's QT? Friendly employees!-DANCES
I keep seeing reviews for $5 & $7 dances, not sure why but they're $10. But thats good they're $10 all day long. I don't know why places charge $20 and whatnot you can't even touch for that. The girl's skill ranges from average to excellent. Mostly average, but they get me aroused which gets the job done. I happened to be wearing a hat when I went and the girl used it in her routine, it was a nice little touch.

-VIP ROOM
They also have a VIP room where basically you can grab their T&A. It's $40 to get in & $20 per dance. So It costs $60 to get in. It's exspensive I know but if you see something you just gotta get some hand time with, it might be worth it. And once you pay the $40 to get in your covered for the whole day.

-THE BAR
The bar is pretty good, it's missing some of the more common beer on tap but if you're flexible it's a good way to save some bucks. They've got a lot of the more common beers in bottles, a little more exspensive but not $5 bucks a pop like you'd expect. The bartenders are very cool and pour good drinks. There is one or two pool tables and plenty of TVs playing games.

-THE WEEKEND
To cover my weekend experience, I didn't really enjoy it the most. First off I'm not the kinda guy that likes a big crowd and this is amplified on the weekend by how small this place is. This is the utter defininition of hole in the wall, but thats why I like this place. Secondly the girls don't approach you as much on the weekend, so it's like you have to go hunt them down, which is the opposite of why I go to the strip club. There is a $5 cover which is very reasonable. I have to say they come out guns blazing with the women, very good selection for whatever takes your fancy. You do need to be careful though some of the women are hustlers and some are real sweethearts just hoping to give you a good time. If you go to the VIP room they might say you got more dances than you did. This didnt happen to me personally but I've heard about it. One girl I brought kept reminding me how many dances I'd gotten(very nice) the other one kept trying to confuse me and buy her exspensive shots. Which sucks cause that one girl is ruining the place's reputation of good service and friendly atmosphere. Just keep your wits about you.

-THE WEEKDAY 
I have a much better time on the weekdays! The place isn't packed, it's much quieter. It's just a cool place to relax and get some female companionship. Everybody's just so laid back and friendly. The women are always coming over to check on you. Their might not be as many to choose from in the middle of the day but there is nothing wrong with their selection. All very good looking women, but you may have to settle for smoldering temptress if the schoolgirl with glasses isn't in yet. There's no cover charge before 6pm so if you plan on being there all night come at 5:30 for free. Happy hour is everyday from 11am-6pm, $1 off drinks. 

-OVERALL
A really cool, inexspensive place to go for T&A. 
P.S. the ATM charges $7 per transaction.It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!I have no complaints about the quality of the medical care.  It's been very good.

I do have a compliaint about the administrative side of the business.  It seems like whenever I have some test done, I am always told that someone will be in touch when the results are back.  That has yet to happen.  Usually I wait way past the date someone is supposed to be in touch and then have to call.  Half the time they say they don't have the results back yet but it later turns out that they did.  The left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing.  I'll keep going there for the quality of the care but they could really use a kick-ass practice manager.Went to Whole Food Market on Friday to for take out. Been to this to this place several times. It is expensive but only go for specific items that you can not get at other places (weird stuff like like shortening that has no PHO, Miso paste, grape seed oil, truffle oil .....etc... and not so weird stuff like fresh fish, cheese and wine). 

This is the first time I went for the ready made food. I agree with some other reviewers, the food looks as if it has been sitting out for some time. My wife has been to the one in Hawaii by Kahala Mall (which just recently just opened within the year) and she said the ready made food is pretty good there. We LOVE the island favorite fresh POKI, this Whole Foods does this dish NO justice. Yuk. (tried it on a previous trip) Can't wait for the family trip to Hawaii to try out the Whole Foods in Hawaii, wife says it has smoked meat section, more selection, and Much better food. 

Enough with what could have been........Friday's ready made meal was Roasted Chicken, Broccoli Crunch, Flat Bread, and Cranberry Cheese. I have to say it took awhile going thru the store to find something that the kids would like and look like it was not sitting out for a long time. The roasted chicken was dry. It must be the fact that they use chickens that are not Pumped up with salt water (was talking to someone about their chicken). The seasoning was good though. Broccoli Crunch was good, kids like it, the crunch was from the fact the Broccoli was not cooked and it had almonds in it. Flat Bread was OK, can't complain about it. One thing I must say a positive about Whole Foods is the Cheese selection, you don't see that set up in too many places (at least where I can go that's a few minutes away). They had a sampling of Cranberry Cheddar out, the kids tried it and got their approval. Oh we also had Potato Leek Soup which was really good in my opinion. 

Fresh Produce, Cheese, Wine, Desserts, Coffee, kitchen cooking hard to finds (if you like to cook), Fresh Fish and Meat. Would be my limited Good things to say about Whole Foods in general. 

I hope they get the message and get better with the prepared foods.I just wanted to add an update for sound quality for the bands... sometimes it's really bad and sometimes it can't be beat....  

Again, the friendliness and service are always right on- great atmosphere.I'm only giving this place three stars but I wish I could give it five. The food is amazing and very moderately priced...especially the honey hot bbq wings and pizzas (which we get everytime we come in). Last time we tried a cheesesteak and it was fantastic! Best I've had in a long time. The happy hour (5 dollars for a premium pitcher of blue moon or fat tire, or 4 dollar for domestic brews) cannot be beat anywhere in the valley. 

The only thing about this place that is not up to our standards is the service.

The girls they hire here are inexperianced, slow and sometimes down right rude. Most of the servers we have experianced forget major parts of our order or forget about our table altogether. Once we were even told "we better hurry up and finish because we are closing in 15 minutes." We had just gotten our food! My friend who was dining with us that night had frid zuchinni that she was in the process of eating and one of the servers literally grabbed it out of her hands and started boxing it up...while she was trying to eat! I've never experianced that level of ignorance and downright rudeness while dining out...ever. and I'm usually prety forgiving being in the restaurant industry myself. The girls just have no clue! 

The food and great happy hour are sincerely the only things that keep us coming back again and again...although I wish it was an overall satisfaction.Eh. Ok food, high school waitresses, blah bar. Wish I liked it more, but blah.Where's the" SHHHHHHHHHHH!"? Went here to STUDY and the place is just as loud as your neighborhood Starbucks.

I'm not THAT old, mid-twenties, BUT why do I feel so old? I want to tell all these people, "back in my day, when I was a little girl we weren't allowed to talk on our cell phones, carry on conversations, or comment on websites while surfing the library's internet."

Its a really nice library. Great A/C. Right next to the mall. Feels clean and safe. Have event scheduled throughout the month for its patrons (which can be easily accessed online.)

Besides everyone disregarding their Library 101 skills, I'm also disappointed in the hours of this branch. Closes at 5 most weekdays.

Maybe I could form a different opinion if I was allowed to go to this branch on a more frequent basis ;)Went here with an empty stomach but armed with a coupon, because that's how we roll! *ka-ching*

'They say there's no such thing as free lunch' - Well, they've probably never used a coupon. We got the buy one lunch entree with beverage, and get another lunch entree for free!

My husband ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.
Verdict: "It's okay but it's not gonna win any awards."

I got the Spaghetti with meatballs.
Verdict: It looks like someone threw up blood on Kermit The Frog's face (see pic). It's okay, but I won't nominate it.

Service: The waitstaff's friendly but we got there early so we didn't really need to scream for attention like a spoiled 5 year old kid.

Anyway, we heard their pizza's great so we'll probably be back to try them (with a coupon, of course). :pI thought the sub way was clean and the service was good.   Long lines sometimes but for the most part pretty goodwe didn't buy our tires here, but they fixed the leak anyway. for free. and they're nice. i like that. with our other cars, discount has provided a great warranty and a decent price.  i regret buying tires for my civic somewhere else ... with them i got a bad warranty and bad service. discount really is a-ok by me.Usually have a little wait even with an appointment, but it gives the kiddo time to play with the train and pick her movie.Total Packer Bar!

This place has become the default Phoenix bar for cheering on the Packers.

Every TV (and there are many) is tuned to the Pack on Sundays!I brought in a couple of watches that are family heirlooms and hadn't been working for a while. 

They fixed both of my watches within a couple weeks. Both watches needed parts that are not readily available, but these guys ordered, and got me taken care of.

I'm not entirely sold on this place. For example, I asked if they were certified by Longines, and they looked at me like I was crazy. 

I'd still come back--they took care of my stuff. You will probably pay a little more, but it's worth it, I guess.Filet with wild mushroom sauce was VERY petite (3-4oz) and overcooked. Told server but no offer to correct.  Otherwise food and service pretty good. But we are leaving a tad disappointed.I have been to this Outback two times in the past 2 years. My most recent experience was much better than the first, which would explain why it took me so long to even try it again! Really, I was dragged here by my in-laws, who love the surf and turf special they currently have. You can get a lobster tail, a sirloin, and a baked potato for $9.99. It's a good price for some decent food. Unfortunately, we splurged on the giant onion blossom and the artichoke appetizer. 

The onion blossom was really good - I must have been craving fried onions cuz oooh baby, they were good. They were a little greasy, especially near the end, but I had my fill. The artichoke appetizer was good as well. Everyone thought it would be flat bread but this was tortilla thin. Still, not bad. Then came the meal. My steak was ordered medium rare but came more medium-well. The taste wasn't bad, but I've had better steaks at home. The lobster was pretty good and the baked potato was meh. I didn't eat it all, but who needs all those extra carbs? 

Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience. I'm not a big fan of franchise dining, but my in-laws chose the place. I probably won't go back on my own volition, but if the in-laws wanted to, I wouldn't say no.The waitstaff is always very friendly here so that is worth 2 stars alone.  I always order the blooming onion, but with ranch because the sauce is so gross.  I ordered a filet on my previous trip and it was so tough I ended up taking it home to my dog (which he thanks you for OUTBACK!!)  So I tried a different kind of steak this time and it wasn't too bad, but again, I only had a few bites.  I will continue to come here (only when friends insist) because of the bread!  A few cocktails, onion bloom, and the bread.  I don't want to waste my money on entrees anymore.  But its not terrible...my dog loves it ;)We were out this way yesterday just exploring and when we drove by my daughter said that looking like a good place so we had an early dinner there.  

I like the atmosphere, cool and laid back, very island like.  There is surfing stuff all over and surfing videos on and the staff is friendly and laid back too.  We had great service.  Drinks arrived promptly and we were checked on several times during the meal.  My daughter had an accident with her milkshake and our server brought her another one quickly, napkins to wipe up with, and wet wipes for her sticky hands.  

I had the Baja soft tacos.  They were good but lacking something...I dont know what though.  I had guac, sour cream and salsa too.  They were good but they needed more flavor.  Maybe it was the way the chicken was cooked, I'm not sure.  My daughter had a kid's meal of a hot dog and fries and she ate it all.  I would probably go back and try a burger sometime.

Mostly I thought the atmosphere was good, very island ish and I liked it.Did a dial in and pick up order.  Ordering was easy and picking up was even easier--- they had the food ready and lunch for 5 people was about $40!  That's pretty cheap considering it was 4 sandwiches with sides (small itty bitty sides) and a salad.  I had the tuna, it was good-- not the best tuna I have had but still good.

Everyone liked their meals, I think I will try for a salad next time, it was huge and my friend really liked it.  

The inside of Breadcrafters is really cute and they have a large variety of desserts and assorted fresh breads to buy.  I need to remember this next time I need desserts and fresh bread, typically around the holiday season.There's an unexplainable culinary phenomenon that's probably happened to each and every one of us, a sandwich for whatever reason always tastes better when someone else makes it. I'm not sure how or why this happens. If you ask around many have already formulated a various theories. Some feel it's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese. Others think that it's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika. My mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey, Muenster cheese, Miracle Whip, bread and butter pickles on Wonder bread. I've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers. 

I recently tested this out at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe in Paradise Valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads, house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else. Breadcrafters isn't your ordinary sandwich shop, as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries, but oh the bread! For me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers. 

To celebrate such amazing bread, why not make amazing sandwiches? 

Nancy's Favorite ($7.75) arrived piled high with roast beef, Gorgonzola and roasted onion spread, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette. Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef, the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love. By contrast the Turkey Jack Stack ($7.75) had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion. The sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful I ordered a loaf ($4.50) to go. 

Unfortunately the Park Avenue Chicken Salad ($7.75) was under-seasoned; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on. On my next visit, Ill just pick up a loaf ($4.50) of the bread and skip the salad. 

When you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit, coleslaw or potato chips. I might avoid the disappointing potato salad. The potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess. 

The love doesn't stop at their bread; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting. On my last visit I picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake ($2.75) and a Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake ($2.75).  On my way back home I couldn't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats. Once home, dessert came first! The shortcake cupcake wasn't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake, then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry. This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites, yes it was that good. Wiping the crumbs from my face I proceeded to convince myself that I would only have a single bite of the red velvet, wrong. I couldn't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake. 

While there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else's hand is better, I do know this, I enjoyed trying to prove this one out.Went here for lunch and had the SW chicken sandwich. It was ok. I wish I had gone with something else because other plates I saw looked really good.  The cookies looked pretty good so I had to partake. I had a chocolate chip cookie called sweet dream. The cookie was amazing!  I would give this place 5 stars for the cookie. It was soft, gooey and had a hint of ginger - delish!  I'd go back, try something else and definitely have another cookie.There are certain grocery stores in the Phoenix area that have a certain reputation.  "All the ASU babes" shop at one Safeway on Scottsdale, or something like that, and the good-looking Arcadia folks can be found at - ah forget it, it's not germane.  
The point is, this particular Fry's has and deserves no such reputation.  This is where everyone from the Square does their grocery shopping.  The closer you can go to closing time (11 PM!) the better off you'll be.  Three stars for price and decent selection, but would it kill ya to sweep the parking lot a little more frequently?The staff was friendly and told me where I could go to find what I wanted.  I appreciated the information.Some coworkers and I ended up here after the team trivia location we were going to go to ended up getting rescheduled (woops!). I have heard of Brigett's but this was my first time there. It is divey but I felt comfortable parking out front and heading in by myself. I found my group and had a seat, and the server was very nice and attentive throughout the night. It is a ways away from home so I can't say I'll be running back, but the crowd inside (on a Thurs night) was chill and I had a good time.It's Denny's? Good bfast this morning!Every two weeks you will find me here getting my nails done. The talent in this salon ranges from pretty damn good to great. The women that work here are very nice. The only complaint that I have is that I have made an appointment twice with my favorite nail tech and both times they confirmed my appointment but when I showed up they claim that I didn't really make the appointment with that tech. My recommendation for them would be to get a receptionist to handle all walk-ins and appointment booking to help avoid "appt theft" and overflow.Average at best.

Queso with Spinach was good but everything with queso had to have spinach. 

Works well for people in that area.....My husband and I like to come here on Sunday mornings for bloody Mary's, its hard to find a cocktail on a Sunday morning so this is our to go place when we want to waste away a dayWe go to Brennans because it is a 2 minute walk from our house. It is a good place to watch a game. Lots of TVs and comfortable tables. Drink prices are reasonable. The food isn't the greatest but it is passable for bar food. Like the title, it is "grub". The Irish Nachos are HUGE. Great for filling your belly alongside beer. And their Mexican pizza isn't bad either. My husband likes their all you can eat Friday fish fry.

Not bad.Why are all Toys R Us so ghetto?  They all have tiny doorways and look like stripped down WalMarts.  There is rarely an enjoyable experience to be had when going to Toys R Us, especially when you hate being around breeders and their spawn.  That being said, this is possibly my favorite Toys R Us.  They always have more than one register open and they actually had freakin ZhuZhu pets.  Can't hate that.  This one doesn't seem to be populated by the same unrestricted breeders that the suburbia ones do so it is slightly more quiet and causes fewer headaches for me.I like shopping at Ace Hardware because I del like it's a "small town hardware store".  I have a hard time walking into this store because the store is too small for all of their merchandise.  Isle are small, shelves are stacked as high as they can, and it's not easy to move around.  The staff is helpful, but most of the time they make you feel as if you're an idiot for asking a question.  I stick to Home Depot and Lowe's.  Easy to navigate without fearing for your life.Definitely a hole in the wall bar. All the bartenders are nice and they have cheap specials. They have board games (which is unique and fun), darts, and arcade games. Some nights they have live local musicians and they play the games on Sunday. Nothing fancy and very tiny, in fact most of the time you will have to order food out b/c they don't have much. The food they do have fried pickles and iguana balls(chicken balls) are really good. Just kind of boring as far as bars go with crappy country music and usually not a lot of ppl in there.I like cold Sapporo on tap, so for this reason, I like Shogun.  I do not order sushi, rather, gyoza are my menu pick, at the bar, in and out.  

It's quick, dark, and takes care of my 80's music quota for the month.

A typical stop-in is for a beer and a snack in between shopping-always makes the errands much more enjoyable....So my mom and aunt are obsessed with Coco's Cinnamon French Toast and that's where they wanted to go for breakfast. Out of all the places this is where they pick. I pleaded with them, there are sooo many better breakfast joints out there, but no, Coco's was my fate. 

We stood at the hostess station for over 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we existed! We were then seated and our waitress was pretty quick and on top of things. Our coffee cups never hit empty. 

I ordered the potato pancakes and they hit the spot. They were actually pretty dang tasty! If I am ever forced to go to coco's again I would for sure get that again. 

Paying at the cashier was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it. 

Not my top choice for breakfast, but wasn't as torturous as I was anticipating.It's ok, pretty typical local bowling alley. 
They offer specials for children in the summer.
There are better bars to get larger drinks for cheaper prices very close by. That was a negative.
It's clean though. 
Probably better for families or kids outings than young adults or couples.We had a pretty nice time on our tour of the Grand Canyon. The best thing is you don't have to make any decisions. The Grand Canyon is big and there are a lot of things you could check out. The tour takes you to a cool selection of views and delivers a satisfying "Grand Canyon Experience" 

The one thing I wasn't a fan of was sitting with everyone else on the tour at lunch. It was awkward.

It's a long day, and I may prefer the privacy of my own car, but it was nice not to drive and we had a fun time.First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service.This place used to be my favorite local sushi spot.  The only downfall recently is that service is either great or awful, no in between.  Last time I went there was a new girl (I think she was new, never saw her there before) at the register and she was quite awful all around.  She spent most of the time on her phone or chatting with employees.  One of the waitresses had to tell her to take my order as she was too busy chatting with the host to notice. She brought my change back to the table with our food then forgot to bring all the food and didn't give me all the change.  Worst part of it is that she was never apologetic about it, she just didn't seem to care.I only give this place 3 stars because our waiter was really nice. The salsa's were not spicy and in need of salt. The Fajitas were so-so. The Flan looked gross. My Margarita was like a slush.  There has to be better Mexican food out there!

Oh, but the corn tortillas were really good.Very close to a 4 star performance.  The shuttle was there within 4 minutes of my arriving, which was great considering it was 102 outside.  The driver was swift, amiable,  and professional, and offered the passengers an iced down bottled water upon getting in.

The hotel itself was clean and the staff great.  There was a decent fitness facility for those of us still pretending to give a shit about the status of our physique.

The shuttles run at the top and bottom of the hour, 24/7, so it's a great choice for the business traveler.This lady's showin' her age.  For a Hilton, it doesn't measure up.  The rooms are decent, the desk was friendly, the bathroom is clean and updated but it's really not much more than a Hampton.  As a Diamond HHonors member, I'm on the Executive level which helps, but not much.  The breakfast is mediocre, but free. 

At $200/night (non-corporate rate), keep driving.

If it matters, I stayed at the Crown Plaza at 44th and Washington and had a very similar impression.Only 3 1/2 stars for this hilton location:  I so wanted this to be a stellar review for our once much loved hilton brand, but it's highly mixed.  Typically we enjoy our stays at various hilton properties - for they have earned our appreciation and ratings through the years of corporate stays as working professionals.  

Sadly this location fell short of the high standards the hilton brand has set.

We stopped of in Phoenix for a day on our way home from a Sedona retreat.

Tired and hungry, we were picked up at the airport by the shuttle driver promptly and quick deposited at the hilton airport Phoenix location.
(Good driver and prompt transport, which we both appreciated ).

The reception staff were prompt and courteous, w rapid checkin and bottled water to ease our parched throats due to the outdoor 106 degree temperature.

The Hilton hotel staffs across the board have been exemplary in Arizona - but this location has a very dated, tired decor and is need of a facelift.  The carpet leading to our room was faded and worn in places.

Once we arrive in our room, we learned our lovely balcony view overlooked the noisy freeway and parking lot and we could barely stand on it - though we wouldn't want to, given the view.  No help for that since this is a location at the airport, which we both understood.

There was also an odd, unpleasant smell in the room which dissipated eventually (though it was more resigning ourselves to the odor since we were just too tired to repack and move).

We left our bags and went down for a meal, only to learn the main restaurant was closed on Sunday afternoon at 5 pm and we could only eat in the loud and noisy sports grill, so we did.

Liz our server was wonderful and would do well in a 5 star restaurant w impeccable service.  The food had good points as well as poor.  My bacon grilled chicken wrap was excellent, the steak fries accompanying it were large and underdone while my husbands steak tacos were so- so.

We turned in early due to our exhaustion and woke incredibly early, so had room service. (Very unusual for us since we are out and about early).  Rick our waiter was prompt,  bringing fresh toast due to a mishap in the kitchen, and soy milk for the coffee.

Unfortunately the coffee was lukewarm (barely) and the toast, despite dressing it up w real butter and strawberry preserves, barely warm despite being brought promptly to us.

The bed was decent, but not the lovely comfort bed we expected from the Hilton brand.  The temperature was off in the room despite being set at its coolest setting, it was still quite warm, almost uncomfortably so.

This is definitely a mixed review - fantastic service and mentioned staff worthy of a 5 star resort while downgraded drastically w the decor of a dated decades past.  Food also a mixed bag, I don't think we will return to this location.Nice place, pool, wifi, with nice,
basic rooms. 

The Bistro concept in the lobby is not working for me. Unlike most Courtyards, there is no free coffee here, you have to buy.  Only one person works the counter, so when you are rushing to appointments or the airport, the wait is far, far too long. Plan accordingly.This is coming from a Hispanic woman very proud of her own home cooking. I make my own tortillas, beans, etc.. Consider the fact that I am a huge fan of my own cooking as you read this review. 

Normally, this is a pretty good joint. It's not bad if you're jonesing for a taco or some really good beans (and don't want to make it yourself). It is considerably tastier than any Filiberto's, and more authentic tasting than places like America's Taco shop. 

My faves are the butter-soaked tortillas, bean burritos, and chicken tacos. I keep it simple in simple joints. Today, unfortunately, it wasn't even close to as flavorful as it usually is. It wasn't worth the hour I put in at the gym afterwards. 

But hey! Normally it is worth a stop, especially if one is deprived of Mexican food at home.This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself.I have a couple friends that love this joint. I thought it was pretty good but had a few small issues. First my order was wrong. Well okay the fixed it right. Well it seemed like it. 

I ordered a the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. I don't think the meat in my enchilada was chicken. If it was supposed be chicken I am still not sure it was chicken. They overall taste was good but not great on this item. 

I did enjoy the tamales though. I can see myself giving this place another shot in the future just based on the tamales."Hand rubbed meat can't be beat." That's what a t-shirt reads. It's hung up on the wall next to other things, like posters with catchy phrases and local acknowledgments of Hap's being the best BBQ around town. 

This place is really just a hop, skip and jump from my office. On a rainy November day, BBQ sounds superb. So, I hop, skip and jump over to Hap's. It's my first time and I'm curious to see how they do BBQ. After all, I hail from the south, you could say, and have eaten some pretty great BBQ in Oklahoma and Texas. 

At Hap's around 12 on a Friday, there's a line out the door. I agree to wait. The wait allows me to check out the decor and patrons. It's mostly men here, and I begin to think, "What a meat market." Literally, with pulled pork, lamb, chicken, ham and links as your choices. But, all I see when I look around are young and middle aged men. Some are rather cute. Who knew such things existed in this business area off Washington and 48th St. 

I'm not the only one with wandering eyes. I notice several of the patrons take notice of me, the only young female in the place. Yep, that's right. I'm here for the BBQ. 

The menu is a bit cumbersome to read. There's the regular menu and a catering one. Then there's a small black board with suggested specials. I jump at the chance to try their smoked BBQ lamb with their mint dressing on the side. Mint isn't the only dressing option you have, but it sounded like the ideal match for lamb - even the little black board said so. 

So, it's my turn at the register. The woman behind the counter gives me a big, friendly smile. I smile back. "I'd like to try your smoked lamb sandwich with mint on the side." I tell her it's to go. She punches up my total - $5.07 - runs my card and hands me a receipt. She also asks for my name, for when you place an order here and it's ready, they shout out your name. Not some number. Not profanity. Your name. Very cool. Well, they didn't have a chance to shout my name. While the woman hands me my receipt copy and card, a man leans over the counter. "Alicia?" Yep. "Here you go. Enjoy." I didn't even have to wait one millisecond. I snatch up the bag and left. It's not that I wanted to eat there, but if I had, there wouldn't have been any open booths anyway - just a couple of stools against the wall, nearly in the way of the line of hungry lunchers. 

I anticipate biting into the sandwich and having an "oohhh" moment. The sandwich is sloppy, pieces of lamp escaping the entrapment of the bun. I dunk the lamb pieces in the mint dressing, which is my favorite part of the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, the meat is good. It just didn't wow me. Nor did the bun, which is your basic hamburger bun you can buy at the grocery store. The sauce was also just okay. I mean, I could tell it was BBQ sauce, but, let's face it, it wasn't oh-my-god BBQ sauce. So... 

3 stars for Hap's. I can see why Phoenix likes this place, for it offers up a plethora of BBQ options and sides, including broccoli and cheese casserole. Or, supposedly, they have a really great cauliflower casserole. My friend says so. If that's not your thing, there's bags of chips, cobbler (peach, cherry, etc.), chocolate nut brownies and even coleslaw. 

So, why not a higher rating? Because I wasn't wowed by their translation of BBQ. Granted, I ordered one simple sandwich, but even that one simple sandwich, with all its flavor and sustenance, wasn't enough for me to deem this place my preferred lunch destination. 

Yet, it's definitely worth checking out. 
(But, as my friend told me, "It's no Honey Bears.")Having only a short window for lunch during a training session I decided to try hap's in Phoenix. While the service and establishment are bright and open, the special smoked chicken salad was so so. A mixture of field greens and minimal tomatoes and raisins left much to be desired. The chicken itself was a little bland but I did refuse the side of bbq sauce.

 The salad did arrive quickly allowing enough time to eat and return to class.I thought Knock Kneed was pretty good.  Although a bit pricey for what you get, I think the ingredients are pretty quality.

What I did notice about the fish is that it doesn't taste super fishy.  Not sure if that's good or bad for you but for me it was great.  I'm not a person who really likes much seafood as I feel it's always too fishy for me.

I got a combo with two pieces of fish.  The breading was outstanding and the hush puppies were dynamite as well.  I'd probably go back just for the hush puppies.  

The condiment bar is a nice touch as well.  You can get all the cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, hot sauce and malt vinegar you want.  Love it.  I got all those.

The cole slaw was pretty decent.  I'm 'A-OK' with this place but I'll probably have to make another visit before I up the star quotient.  

Ambience,..?  Uh...it's alright.  I like the open window lighting.  But the 'hood aspect of the location gets five stars from me.  Two strip clubs within walking distance.  Well, allllright.

Pretty good.Pretty good, but we're still looking for that GREAT fish and chips place in the Valley. I'd say this one is slightly better than average. The breading stayed ON the fish, which is a plus and the fish itself was nice and flaky without being too oily. The breading was a bit bland though, even after being doused in lemon juice and malt vinegar. 
I tend to think $6 is a bit steep for one piece of fish and fries, but since I only had one piece of fish they seemed to just fill the rest of my plate with french fries. The fries weren't anything special, but they were good with malt vinegar and ranch dressing.
Definitely a dive in a divey neighborhood, but overall a solid 3 stars.I've had to travel through Phoenix a couple times recently because I was stupid enough to fly on US Air.

Cons:
1. It's huge and it seems like it takes forever to get from point A to B, which can be annoying when US Air cancels your flight and you're running around trying to find a way to get back to Seattle.

2. I swear there are US Air employees hawking credit cards like every 10 feet.  It gets annoying.

Pros:
1. There is this place called the Blue Burrito Grill and it kicks the butt of all other airport food.  They're super fast and we had an amazingly good chicken burrito there last time.Each terminal has a different personality.  If you live in Phoenix and fly often (weekly as I do) then consider using United which flies in and out of terminal 2.  It is the smallest terminal, has quick lines at the ticket counter, the security gates, and is comfortable for seats, red carpet club lounge, and has a few restaurants now.  Smaller is better at this airport.  Remember, Terminal 2......

I told ya so!

Also, when people are reviewing airports, why do they confuse the bad service from airlines as something that the airport did to ya?pretty decent airport.. never had any problems with the personnel... only complaint is that it could use a little more sprucing up.. the airport itself seems like its stuck in the 90's.. there is definitely a need for workstations in this placeThe airport seems ok. A bit dark and depressing for my taste, plus the water is more expensive than Midway.

Baggage claim is nicer than Midway, though! We got off the plane quickly but the monitors already had our flight listed and which carousel the baggage would be on whereas Midway didn't have the monitors and you had to mill around the carousels trying to guess which one would have your stuff. So that's definitely a plus for PHX!

Visited: 11/14/09 & 11/21/09Although driving around the airport finding terminals or exits can be somewhat confusing, once on foot inside it's very straight forward and easy to get around.

Security line wait was very reasonable and gates easy to find.  Food wasn't anything special.  Like all airports, food and bottled water is overpriced and fair in quality.  I never expect much from airport food so Sky Harbor is right on par.

Short term garage parking is plentiful but a little pricey.  Overall a decent experience with no real complaints.This off airport facility includes all Rental Companies. Take the bus from the middle curb at arrival level. Expect a 10 minute ride. If you're not Hertz Gold expect to wait in line to get your car. Although the weekly rates are low, facility taxes and fees could add a $100 to your bill.hey it is what it is right... Point A to Point BI can't say too much about this airport, but I know their restrooms are clean! That is a huge plus for me.

Bad thing is the terminal I was in had a poor variety of food. :(Average airport.

Checking in and security were easy to get through with ample space unlike some airports where you can't move without stepping over someone or feel like lining up in the center of the terminal.

There's not that much to do at this airport and food options were very limited.
There weren't really enough seats for everyone to sit but then it's better than some other airports I've been to.

Middle of the road rank wise for US airports.As far as airports go, like everything else in life, there is the good...the bad...and everything in between.  And that's where I think PHX falls...in between.

Now, let's start with making connections between terminals, even with airlines who are partners.  There is no tram, so you have to take a bus.  Always make sure you have plenty of time to go between terminals.

As for the terminals themselves...they definitely are in need of an update.  The carpeting, the doorways, the layouts...a bit dated.  

This airport just reminders of a smaller scale airport that grew too fast too soon.  And for a major hub, it definitely needs to be looked at.

On the other hand, the airport personnel (not airline personnel) are very nice.  That's what they have to make up for the facility itself!I like the free wifi.  Bonus points there.

They've got a great system based on numbers and colors on the doors so if someone is picking you up in a car it's easy to tell them "Hey, I'm standing next to the blue 4 door 26.  However, if you're like me, the last time I was picked up at this airport by my little brother who lives in Phoenix we discovered that there is a 4 South and a 4 North...  That is, we EVENTUALLY figured it out.  Well, isn't that special.

You DO NOT want to change airlines in Phoenix.  Not only do you have to leave the terminal and find an airport shuttle to take you to the other terminal (where you have to reprocess through TSA hell) but the airline didn't instruct me on how to do this.  I went running down to the other end of the terminal trying to find the right gate only to be told I had to leave the terminal to take the tram/shuttle.  Just TRY finding the right door to leave and catch the right tram.  It was an adventure, I tell you.  TSA check point was so backed up I'd have never have made my connecting flight.  Thank goodness that flight was running late and the airline rebooked me on another flight or  I'd have been SOL.

Not my favorite airport ever - Denver has way better food options, for example - but it gets the job done.  And so can I on the free wifi.I like phoenix its clean and classy.  I dont really have much bad to day...but nothing stands out.A pleasant enough place to stop-over on my flight from Las Vegas back to Newark, NJ. It was clean and the security staff was polite.

The food options seems varied, from cheap food to expensive, so there's a little something for everyone there.

Can't say I left the terminal I was in, so I have not many details that I can include.Decent airport. Not much selection in food, but the wi-fi is fast and the terminal is pretty wide which reduces congestion.Pretty standard stuff. I've transferred flights here a bazillion times, and walked through it like, once.Like:  

They have stores which sell southwest tchockes like tequila lollipops embedded with teeny worms, made in China dream catchers, and lots of turquoise. Fun browsing before a flight.

Very close to the city.  If you have a car you can be downtown in minutes.

Although nothing to do with the airport itself, I love flying into Phoenix from the north:  You will most likely fly over Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Sedona and the view can be astonishing.

Don't Like:

Lot's of old folks moving VERY slowly through security
Southwest terminal can get insanely crowded (although they have re-built one of the concourses recently and it's heaps better).
Expect turbulent landings here in the summer months.

Lastly, when I was here in January the Southwest baggage handlers sent my luggage to the wrong airport.Not my favorite airport, but definitely not the worst. TSA Sent me to the wrong place to get a SuperShuttle outside, which sucked in the heat carrying my luggage, but otherwise I had a pleasant experience. The security line was lonnnnng on a Thursday afternoon, but the TSA Agents were actually friendly. 

Note to all: You can opt OUT of that body scanner, its not required. Just as ai was about to request to opt out, a new x-ray machine line was opened and their scanner was broken sooooo I got to walk right through. Aces!

I like the tables located at my gate with the charging stations, made getting some juice for my iPhone a lot easier.The airport was easy to navigate and I got my luggage quickly. I wasn't crazy about walking in the heat to the bus to the rental car area.I never realized how HUGE this airport is. I was here on a short layover from Cabo San Lucas, so I had to pass through customs here. It was pretty painless and I mentally prepared myself for a 3 hour layover. Plenty of shops and plenty of food options. 

My only suggestion (if you're using Yelp to find food), call the place and figure out exactly WHERE the restaurant you're looking for is actually located. I walked all over Terminal 4 before I gave up searching for what I wanted, and just got a turkey sandwich instead.Kinda cramped for the volume of fliers that come through here, but you really don't have a choice with USAir.Many, many changes to the dining variety. No complaints.

Some of the water faucets have fill stations for water bottles .... very nice!

I fly Southwest & US airlines and have been through this airport many, many times. Free, easy to use Internet and clean.Super super busy airport, it's chaos all around! From walking through the terminals to trying to find seating in a restaurant or gate! It's just chaotic!! They  have a moderate selection of restaurants. Mostly quick grab and goes in terminal AIt would be nice if in Terminal 4 on the C gates they had more of a food selection for those of us at the mercy of Southwest Airlines.  There is just one small bar, maybe 6 bar seats and that is it.  Overpriced boring sandwiches and that is about it.Clean, easy to navigate, and uncrowded.  However, you should plan on LOTS of walking when switching terminals!I hated our terminal.  We were flying out of Southwest and were Gate C I believe.  There was only 1 bathroom within the whole area, and not many food options.  But I have flown out of Phoenix plenty of times and it has been better in other terminals.When I came here at the end of march the lines were very long and the airport seemed disorganized. Staff was nice but the airport was very backed up compared to other airportsThe problem with most airports: not addressing the needs of its customers. Usually, we need to check in early that we end up waiting around for the boarding and departure. What do most travelers these days do? They use their smart phones or tablets/iPads to entertain themselves while waiting. What do most airports lack? Charging stations! 

Instead, those of us who are using these devices end up fighting over the coveted spaces that have been equipped with charging stations. I've noticed that some of the seats have outlets built in along the bottom of the chairs. Why can't more of these updated seats be added to the airports? Not everyone needs a small workspace area as I've noticed in some airports. Instead, we just need the ability to charge our devices while we entertain ourselves or work during the waiting period for our departure. Until I see an airport that does address these needs, I can't issue anything above a 3 star rating.

As for the facilities, it looks like they've tried to bring in more restaurants with a modern look and feel. The restaurant areas look significantly better than the walkways and seating areas.I had no problems with AAWL. We adopted a wonderful dog in 2009, and since then we've always dropped in every now and then to see if we could find him a friend. Summer of 2011 we officially went on the hunt for another dog, and decided to go to AAWL. We found a few dogs we felt would be a good match and was told to bring our dog back in for a meet.
Now here is where my problem begins. We come in with our dog, and 2 people I've never seen or talked to that worked there helped us. Go figure. I have no idea who these 2 were but anyway... They tell us to go in the little area, and we wait wait wait in the heat with our dog. Really thats not the problem but finally we get the 2 people and they tell us that they will be in control of the dogs. They took our dog, put him on a leash, and never once asked us any questions about him.... got the other dog, brought her in.  They let my dog basically control the entire situation...the guy just followed my dog wherever he went, I'm shocked he even put a leash on him if he was going to just let it be a free for all let the dog do whatever he wants! But he did, and I've never EVER introduced my dog to any dog like that before because I know he can come off very strong at first. I tried explaining to them I thought it was a bad idea to just let him control the situation, they didn't seem to care and by that time the  dogs were both showing their teeth and barking. This all happened in the course of 2 mins...maybe...and the guy was like, ok well they don't get along. Sorry. And i'm thinking are fu**ing kidding me??? I've NEVER in my life heard of introducing dogs like that. We tried another dog, and they did the same thing..just let the dogs do what they want. It went better but eventually my dog was knocking over the chairs and kinda freaking out. It was just bad. I thought it was very unprofessional for people that work with animals all day long. I went online when I got home to make sure I wasn't crazy, and searched ways to introduce dogs. Needless to say they did it pretty much the worst way possible. Very disappointed.  On top of this, the 2 workers told us they would go back and check the files to see if they could find a good match for Bruce. About 1-2mins passed and I decided to go to the kennel area, so I left my dog with my husband and turned the corner to find the 2 just chatting. So much for finding a match for my dog..or caring that these animals get adopted. 
I'm not saying all the workers there are terrible. Many of them are helpful, especially one guy who is there almost all the time. I can't remember his name. However I had to share that story, I don't usually do the whole negative story thing but I was very disappointed.I have been using this company easily for 15 years, before they changed to the current company name (sold I think).  I travel probably 6-8 times a year these days, but used to be much more frequently.  They give discount for AAA, which is good--makes it same as most coupones.  BUT finally, I am changing.  Some drivers are good, some drive too fast and agressively, and it's hit and miss what kind of service you get.    Generally, the pickup is fast at the lot and at the airport.  I do not like the reservation system for covered parking--it should be first come, first served--this is my final frosting on the cake.  I am changing and trying a different company today when I travel.  Too many times not so great service.Mention "YEL.001" to receive the $6.00 per day and one time service fee of $2.50I was in Phoenix around two weeks ago, and the first stop I made along with my husband was to Stockyards Restaurant. This establishment is historical and has been around forty-seven years! A steakhouse rated as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix, I was eager to try it as soon as our plane touched down. It was even mentioned in the in flight magazine as one of the best steakhouses in the United States. 
Upon our arrival, we found that Stockyards was located in a more industrial section of the city, not downtown. It had a more formal feel with historical photos of the stockyards on the walls and a saloon, but not in the touristy sense, more somber and dark.
Our waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. I think he may have been mentioned in other Yelpers' reviews.
Now for the food...I had a beef brisket sandwich with many slices of lean meat on it. The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce, which had a flavor I was not wild about. My sandwich was accompanied by a large helping of fries, tasty and crispy.
My husband ordered the steak sandwich. When it arrived it was a large juicy steak, but served open-faced. My husband didn't like this. In fact, he requested a another piece of sandwich roll for the top. The steak was ultimatey too chewy to eat in this fashion, and had to be cut in pieces with a knife. In other words, the steak was not very tender. His meal also came with fries. Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead, but my husband did not listen to him! 
Overall, I would give Stockyards a solid three stars. It did not quite live up to our expectations, but it was not bad, either. The sandwiches we had at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona were way better, however.Went there for a business lunch and was very impressed.  They got us seated right away even though the parking lot was completely full.  It appeared to be a very popular business lunch location due to its location.  Our waiter was efficient but I did not feel rushed.  The atmosphere matched the menu.  The steak was outstanding and the portions were adequate for a lunch time meal.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their selection as I did.I had the Pear Salad and added salmon.
It was very yummy - but very expensive 
$23 
The menu is a little misleading...
The way it was laid out I thought the salad was $18...
but when the bill came it was $23 
The most expensive salad I have ever had...

The service was good,...
They keep our water full
Friendly staff greeted us when we arrivedWe use Snappy occasionally when we need a big clean up of the yard or we don't have time to mow the lawn.  We have a HUGE yard with a lot of grass.  What I like about Snappy is that their charges are reasonable - maybe even cheap - and they have incredibly fast response time.  They do a very nice job and they are very efficient.  My only complaints are their inconsistent pricing and they don't take AMEX.  I have received bills for more than twice the amount quoted for yard work...  when I call to question the bill, they always adjust the bill down to the original quote - but nonetheless, it questions their trustworthiness.  We would probably use them more regularly for service if I felt that their billing was reliable and if they accepted AMEX since it's the safest way to pay and I'm nervous about a company having my credit card number if their billing is a bit questionable.  Overall - good lawn service but not-so-good billing.I work really close so I stop in every few weeks. It's standard sub-fare but not great. Nothing special. Service is always fast and the girl who works the counter is friendly and efficient. Ifs a family run place with mom, dad, and daughter (I assume). Dad is never friendly...I usually just get a blank stare from him. 

I usually get the #48, turkey, ham, bacon. They offer white or whole wheat bread but I usually get the white even  though I'd prefer whole wheat. But I avoid it because the ww bread is always stale.

It is what it is and I'll keep going.Definitely a museum of culture. 

We stayed at the hotel across the street, we were looking to pass the time between checking out and going to the airport. Easy walk through outside and in. I'm glad we got to stop by. Perfect, relaxing and casual ending to our trip. 

Definitely learned things. My fave part were the artifacts on the inside. The pictures of haunted places was really cool too!OK, I am getting tired of catching the new employees overcharging me. Every time we go there there seems to be a new wave of newbies. We go there enough and always get the same thing so I know exactly how much it is supposed to cost. The last two times there I had to have a manager (also new) cancel and re-ring my purchase. The employees always want to debate with me so I just ask for the manager to double check the total. So far I am batting 1000. Today the guy had a bit of an attitude when I busted him. I always give them my loyalty card which shows them that we have been there well over 300 times. You would think that they would train their employees to pay attention to the customer visit count, especially with super-regular customers. We were wondering how much extra money they make $2 at a time with travelers that don't know any better. I have heard that this is a training location...trial by fire I guess in this always busy shop... but then someone else said it is not. I am still suspicious of all the new employees every couple weeks.

The cookies and sandwiches are still awesome. The sandwiches may actually be the best of all the locations I go to, probably because they do so much business here that everything is always super fresh. It is hard to give the cookies less than 3 stars but if this problem persists I will be downgrading this location again.Paradise Bakery & Cafe is just a codename for Panera Bread Company. And as wikipedia nicely puts it "As of 2009, it is wholly owned by Panera Bread."

I would have to say that, much like Panera Bread, Paradise Bakery and Cafe is just OK. I do like that they have a plethora of options for a traveler on the go like myself, but I don't think that there is anything outstanding about any of those options. I typically will get a half sandwich/half salad or half salad/half soup and while I do have a favorite, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it if I had better options available. 

Their seating is severely limited that you probably will have to sit on the seats near your gate and have your meal. Not a fan! 

Overall, the items on the menu are fine, but they certainly lack imagination. I do like that they list their calorie count, so for someone who is conscious about what I eat, I can at least eat in peace knowing I'm not stretching my budgeted daily calories. They do offer a free cookie with your entree, which I should add is practically over half of my daily calories worth...I decided to eat it in the span of two days to feel better about it. The chocolate chip cookie was only OK, so it wasn't really worth it to eat all those calories in the end. 

Knowing how bad airport food can taste, I give Paradise three stars for being a better airport option than most and having a variety of options for all types of picky eaters.Went for a couple hours last Sat....the person at the clubhouse admission gate was a lady in her 70s (?) but was very nice...admission to clubhouse was $4 vs. $2 in grandstand...seating was extra...nice and clean clubhouse and downstairs was also clean as well.....saw newspaper clippings in clubhouse about when track opened in 1950's....and it doesn't look like grandstand area has been updated much since....concessions were a bit more than Wendys or the type but less than major league pro sports venues...but prices for beer and mixed drinks weren't posted...like to know how much before hand....quality of horses and racing was like Triple-A minor league...most of the races had field sizes a bit small for my liking (6-7 instead of 10-12)Fun place to come out when the weather is nice to watch the ponies race. The interior and grandstand area (didn't go into the clubhouse) could use some renovations/updating but we were standing outside most of the time so it was no big deal. 

Parking was free and the food was ok. A good deal during dollar days. Check out their website for specials. There's almost always something going on.My Dad loves this place so we usually join him.  It's a bit run down but ghetto fabulous.  Cheap beer & mixed drinks, popcorn and a nice walk around the grounds to see the horses make for a nice afternoon.This is pretty much all you got here in AZ, I guess.  And for that kinda big but still small fun, it does its job.

I can honestly say that in the midst of the fun with the kids that I somewhat forgot I was in a small place in Phoenix.  It has a big amusement park feel because of the layout and of course the sounds of rides everywhere.  The atmosphere actually hits the mark.

Adults CAN have fun here if they don't take things too seriously or expect too much.  This isn't Cedar Point.  This is a big permanent carnival, minus the house-o-fun.  And you're not going to get high-end rides here.  So as long as you go in knowing that this is going to be a "eh, good enough" type ordeal, you'll be good.

The big coaster is decent but over very quickly.  Two loops and a high speed makes it fun while it lasts though.  Again, if you're trying to compare this to something like The Millennium Force...or even The Magnum, you're going to hate it.  Cut the place some slack, its not able to be a big dog like that.

Once you're done with that, its downhill in terms of thrills.  They have the Skydive ride that drops you straight down from a high height...can make mom scream, I guess.  The line moves quickly so its worth a go.  Everything else is low thrill, decent fun, and mostly for the younger kids.  Your go-karts are slower than they need to be, but I guess for the younger kids' sake, that's how they keep it.  Bumper cars are bumper cars.  Bumper boats is ordinary with a nice little island thingy to mess around with.  Karts and boats lines moved terribly slow.

I didn't visit the arcade...dunno how that happened.

Mini golf was pretty fun.  Well designed courses and decently upkept.  Very nice scenery.

Food was terrible.  I mean it.  Oh man.  Had a gyro...it had ranch and hot dog onions on it.  Not ok.  Fries were bad.  Churro was horrible.  Even the lemonade should've been thrown in the garbage.  And the wait was ridiculous.  One lady waited at least 20 minutes for some burgers or something.  My cuz mentioned the nacho chips were crap.  An old lady started swearing loudly after she bit into her chili dog, then she body slammed a small child.  Kidding.

But is it a good time?  Yes.  Take your kids.  They will have PLENTY to do.  And go with a group of 8 riders or more...you get a substantial discount...unless that is only on certain weekends.  Ask the cops who stand outside to guide the lines (yes, its that crowded on Saturdays).  Speaking of staff - everyone actually had a decent attitude...no smarmy kids who showed that they hate their job.

We paid about $15 bucks for all day passes and a round of golf after we gathered up 8 riders.  Otherwise, its like $26 for that same package.  Check the website for accurate pricing.  Too expensive?  Well I mean its either this that has a lil' roller coaster, or CrackerJacks, Fiddlesticks, Amazing Jakes or...thats about it.  Yeah you get a buffet at Amazing Jakes for less - so I guess thats the only competition.

Oh..and I read about how the 'shady' crowd seems to hang out here.  I didn't see anything like that at all...and this was a Saturday.  Its just young people.  The same 'kind' that you see anywhere else.  Don't let any of those types of comments put you off from going here.  No one's gonna shank you..Fun mini golf. Classic Arcade.. A nice throwback to the old days of spending quarters playing Area 51. Prices for the games weren't too bad either....Decent food for a decent price. Has tons of menu items, from breakfast to bbq to burgers, hot dogs and Mexican. Building is somewhat run-down.Last week I was driving down Broadway in Phoenix and a little yellow building caught my eye.  The sign read "Mims Burger & Mexican Food".  I made a few more passes by later in the week and last night I decided to bite the bullet and check Mims out.

The building appears to be quite old and the restaurant is nothing fancy.  A few tables and long counter style table with stools and some older pinball and arcade games.  The menu has various prices scrawled on it with some items crossed off.  Nothing fancy here.

The menu offers a mix of standard American fare, southern and Mexican food.  I was tempted to order a hot link or BBQ plate but I was a bit short on funds so I ordered cheap: green chili burrito and chili dog.  The burrito left much to be desired.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't better than a Don Miguel frozen burrito.  The chili dog, however, was quite delicious.  

It took a few minutes for my order to be ready but that's okay.  Everything was prepared as I ordered.  They didn't have dogs sitting there ready to go.  I don't mind waiting for someone to actually cook my food.

Mims offers a lot of BBQ options and I think that may be the bread and butter here.  When I return that's what I'm going to try.  If they can serve up a good BBQ plate then I may have to upgrade my star rating.Yeah its a window. Hardly any parking to speak of. Would give it a higher review if it was a an actual sit down resteraunt. My pizza wings and bread sticks were fine. But have to say I get better quality from domino's pizza.Nice selection of plants, staff a little standoffish. I had a bunch of questions and picked up a few flowers.Food is decent, I had the gyro and Greek fries. Nothing to write home about. I'd expect the same quality from a food cartThis is another one of those reviews where I wish I could leave half stars. Since I can't, I'm giving it a lower grade because I just don't think it's worth 4 stars. For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.

All in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!This location is near my work so if I want to get out and grab a quick bite I can do it.  I've gone though the drive-thru and gone inside to eat.  I have never been to a fast food burger place that brings your order to your table along with condiments and asks if you need anything else.  That is a very nice touch.  And they are friendly and smiling.  I am a purist and I usually eat my burgers plain.  Yes, plain.  No lettuce, no condiments, no nothing. I've been eating them this way since.....well.......since I started eating burgers and that was too long ago cause I'm old.  The burger was fresh, the bun was fresh and soft and the fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I have no compliants.  Would this be my first choice for a fast food burger?  Not really but it's decent and they offer chicken options too.  It's busy at lunchtime both inside and at the drive-thru.  Service is fast though.  I honestly don't know how they keep the lines at the drive thru moving so quickly.  Thanks Whataburger for being a decent lunch option for me.Whataburger are one of the well known fast food in this area and this is really a messy one.

I want to acknowledge first their service! I can give them 5 star for that but their service is not all that I came here for. Its their food and their service but the food has the biggest factor here.

The burger I ordered was really messy, dont know how the hell did it become that messy. I guess the kitchen staff need a little training on cleanliness on their food.

The 5 star service that I wanna give is for the Counters. For the food its 1. My final Rating would be 3 star.clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.After having multiple people telling me this is the best mexican food around, I figured I had to try this place. I was no where near impressed.  The only upside was the salsa and chips, hot and fresh and the salsa had zip but a great flavor. I got the sampler meal and it was subpar.  I can think of multiple places better than this for Mexican food. Ohh well atleast I can say I tried it.I went to Poncho's today for lunch with the BF and it was ok. The place was very busy, so I thought that was a good sign. We waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back. We were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle. The chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup...ick. After 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar, but slightly less tomato -y, salsa...not a win. For lunch, I had the mini pollo fundido and the BF had a taco and tostada. My food was alright, the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special, but the sauce was good and the rice was really good. Sort of what I expect from a cheap Americanized Mexican restaurant. The BF's taco was fine....also nothing special, but not bad. The prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large. I think it's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that Bill Clinton ate here 15 years ago or so, they have the newspaper clippings all over....I definitely lol'd. Anyway, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.Wow this place was packed for a Thursday night. With a half an hour wait I was expecting great things. Everything was just average. The chips were greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to write home about. The pricing is very reasonable. The Carne Asada was thick but very chewy, not the best piece of meat. The frozen margarita was very good and I had a bite of someone's tamale and tostada and those were both very good. The ambiance is more of what people go for I think. The interior is very cozy and welcoming like someone's home.At Poncho's you will find good Mexican food, but there is always a weird musty smell that I can't get over.  If you do go, I reccomend the frozen margaritas.  They are poured straight out of a machine, but they are delicious.This is my neighborhood Chinese delivery place.  Sure, you can eat there too, but I think it tastes even better when I'm curled up on my sofa.

They have a pretty good delivery area and their food is pretty darn tasty.  It's not as good as a few places that used to deliver to me in other parts of town, but considering my location, I need to be happy w/ what I have.  

The prices are awesome.  That is definitely a bonus.  Ordering dinner there once often equals at least 2 dinners at my house, and often 2 dinners and a lunch.  

The only advantage to going there, is that they have those cool drinks w/ the little tapioca balls in the drink.  I keep meaning to go by just to try one. I think they are called Boba drinks?  Hard to remember when I haven't gotten it and they aren't listed on their to go menu.  

Anyhow, it's worth trying if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you like those drinks - I know there aren't too many places in Phx that have them yet.Awww...this place is really, really cute. 
I was introduced to the Farm when a friend held their wedding reception in the courtyard. It was beautiful and the food was delish. The restaurant is great, but when I took friends here for lunch it wasn't exactly what i had expected. The sandwiches were fairly overpriced for what they were, the drinks were even pricier.  You have to order your food up at the front instead of being waited on and even though it was quite busy, I still found the staff to be aloof and inattentive.
If you're looking for a place to bring mom or to have brunch with girlfriends, the setting alone is enough of a reason to bring them to the Farm...otherwise I would suggest somewhere else if you're looking for a an everyday breakfast or lunch spot.I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after hiking South Mountain. What an adorable place this is! It was pleasant to walk around the property, relax, and enjoy the scenery. I think you will appreciate this place if you don't compare it to similar *greener* places from where you probably grew up. 

I got the Tuscan sandwich and thought it was decent (although pricey). If I ever hike nearby again I would definitely go back and try something else!The ambience and the setting is awsome but i expected a lot more from the food.  Came out slighlty on the cool side so by the time I was finishing my plate it was warm at best.  We had breakfast but i will be going back to try their lunch and dinner.Not that great! For the prices I expected much better food. Lacked that special something and pretty small portions. Outdoor breakfast seating was beautiful and staff was sweet. Just left me desiring more....I went out last saturday and had an good experience.  There was no bev. cart lady, the greens had been recently worked but for 20 bucks the price was right.Went there last night with some friends. We decided to sit in the patio since we get pretty loud and it seemed like everyone was watching the SUNS game in the lobby, so we were like, lets chill outside. So we walk up to the tables, one after another and they were all DIRTY and stank of beer. Checked atleast 8 tables and decided to eat in the lobby. Does anyone ever cleans the patio area? 3 stars is for the awesome and quick service. Wings came out right away and were deliciously seasoned. Wings were perfect. Please tell your waitresses to clean the patio once a month atleast.I've been a big fan (a five star fan of Sakana) for at least 5 years. When we moved to the South in 2006 and tried a handful of Sushi places in mid-sized southern towns I really missed Sakana. We went last night to celebrate the New Year and I was disappointed. I think they may have changed management I know they change distributors. The just wasn't the same. Maybe they're cutting corners because of the economy. Who knows? At any rate I'll probably just drive up the Scottsdale location next time -hopefully Ray is still running that show to perfection.The fish is always very fresh and portion sizes are generous.  The fiji albacore tuna is pretty good when in season.  They have great deals from Mon-Thurs.  1/2 price sushi rolls.  Their rolls are always fresh and huge.Why, oh, why is Teppanyaki such a challenge!?!  It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.

My nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...

We were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.

The teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.

So basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  

The server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.I randomly get the worst sushi cravings known to man, so I found Sakana on Yelp and decided to check it out. We got there for happy hour, and obviously that means it's going to be busy, I get it. We walk up to the hostess and let her know there will be 2 of us. She responds, "It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so..." This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, "That's fine...can you put my name on the list?" She actually responded, "Oh, you want to wait?", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a "shared table", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table. The food was pretty good - not the best sushi I've had, but certainly not the worst, a little overpriced even with happy hour and most of my review was just based off of how completely inept the hostess was, but I won't punish the food. :)I tend to go more for the independently owned breweries, but I enjoy Rock Bottom. As with any large chain, I suggest sticking to the seasonal beers made available, as they tend to have more character and depth than the standard fare offered every day. But your mileage may vary.

Looking for an appetizer? Go with the pretzels. You won't be disappointed. My wife is a fan of their Grilled Salmon Caesar salad. Me? I tend to pick whatever is on special. The "fireman pizza" (or whatever it was called) was rather uninspiring. 

All and all, a solid place for a good meal and brew.It's okMacayo's offers a broad selection of Mexican favorites like enchiladas, burritos, chimis, etc.  I had a chicken chimi and it was very flavorful.  The salsa is delicious with just enough heat. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is enormous, but the interior decor is interesting to say the least.  It is overly bright inside, like a Mexican Denny's.  There are fake animals everywhere and enough fake plants to make Rainforest Cafe jealous. Overall this is just an average Mexican restaurant in a town full of great Mexican restaurants.I would defintley come back for the desert but the rest of the meal was so-so and definitely overpriced.Let me start off by saying that the service was absolutely great. I couldn't have asked for a better bartender or waitress. 

Now that being said - maybe this place isn't so bad if you're into paying an arm and a leg to cook your own food. I came here hungry so it was a bit of a pain to have to wait minutes in-between bites.

The upside to the slow eating process is the great time you get to spend with your date conversing and not rushing through a meal - that's always a great change of pace. Atmosphere was dark and relaxing and seating was very comfortable."Keegan's Grill...seriously?" That was my response when I was asked to go to Keegan's Grill for lunch Sunday afternoon. Typically I won't step foot in an American chain restaurant. You know the ones - who serve uninspired bar food and sing happy birthday songs. 

Keegan's Grill is different. There are only 3 in the area and compared to the American chain restaurants, who serve @$@! bar food, they have a decent menu. 

They take pride in their homemade soups, which I was drawn to. I ordered their onion soup. The base had pretty good flavor, the onions were nicely caramelized, the crouton was just the right size, topped with just enough cheese, and most importantly, it was served piping hot. 

I'm not sure if Keegan's Grill is the kind of place where I will plan in advance to go, but overall it was pretty good.My lunch buddies and I checked out Mimi's on line before we headed over. I couldn't decide whether I wanted breakfast or lunch but eventually decided to allow myself a carb-filled lunch. 

I ordered the strawberry lemonade and fried zucchini to start. The lemonade was sugary goodness! The zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand breaded. They came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara. They were well liked at our table.

For lunch, I ordered the pot roast sandwich with fries. Friend 1 ordered a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder. Friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread.

Friend 1's salad came with a fresh baked muffin of her choice. She chose carrot cake. When all of our food arrived, Friend 2 ordered a muffin for fear of stealing an unapproved bite of Friend 1's muffin!

My food looked SO good when it arrived. I took a BIG bite of my pot roast sandwich. Booo.... SO BLAND! No seasoning whatsoever. What did they cook their roast in? Water? Just plain water? After doctoring my sandwich with creamed horseradish and salt, it was passable. The meat was tender and warm, but that's all it had going for it. It came on a thick sourdough bun which was good, but I ended up taking most of the bun off to just eat the meat, lettuce and tomato. The french fries were crispy and hot and the ranch I dipped them in was good! I'm very picky about my ranch.

Friend 1's meal was "eh...ok." She said the chicken and fruit was supposed to be on the side and not all cubed up. The corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless. She said she didn't even taste the corn.

Friend 2's meal was "Decent" he said that he was starving so he just wolfed it down, but his favorite part was the fries, not the sandwich.

We suspect, due to the "older" crowd we were surrounded by, that the lack of seasoning and the cubed bites of fruit were for their sake. 

Will we visit Mimi's again? Yes! There is SO much on the menu that it would be foolish to not try something else! I think I'll go for breakfast next time!Not the normal food I like, but the staff are always very friendly, and very accommodating. I ask for weird things, like milk on the side, and they never make a fuss about it.  
Plus, I am a sucker for their pot pies:)I have been to Mimi's several times and at many different locations around the valley. I enjoy going there for breakfast as I am not a huge fan of their lunch selections. I love their Mixed Berry Pain Perdu, which is stuffed french toast, their turkey sausage is very good as well and lets not forget their Sunrise Pomosa to wash it all down with! While I am a fan of their breakfast I will have to say that it didn't matter which Mimi's location I was at they definitely lack in service, our waiter/waitress was rarely around and if you needed refills on your drinks you had to flag down another employee just to have them ask your waiter/waitress for you. Overall its a place to go for breakfast when you are not in hurry!We decided to end our Summer Vacation at On The Border!

Josh took excellent care of us!  We sat on the patio all by ourselves! 

The chips were really great and the salsa was a bit more intense than usual, which was fabulous. We found out OTB doesn't have pickles for their kid's burger.  The Mahi Mahi grilled tacos are really tasty. 

It was a great ending to our Summer Vacation fun!Only went because we had a gift cards.  Otherwise, based on the yelp reviews and the fact that it is a chain restaurant we wouldn't have gone otherwise. 

The garbage can out front was so full it was spilling out on the sidewalk.
The free chips and salsa were okay.
The service was not very good at all - the restaurant was almost empty, lots of employees standing around and the food took FOREVER.
Kids menu options are good and inexpensive.  The meal comes with main dish, side dish, drink and dessert sundae.  
The lunch fajitas were good (except the veggies were cold and had to be remade.)  My son and I shared them and had more than enough food.
We were charged 99 cents for a side of queso which was not worth the money.
Drinks are $2.49 each!!  Pricey!
The kahlua mud pie was $6.50.  It wasn't bad but quite small for the price.  I much prefer the one at Elephant Bar and it is much bigger and less expensive.took my daughter for her bday. to start off the bread wasnt sliced and was salty, rigatonys bread is way better.  the appetizer was very good stuffed mushrooms with crab.  the food is very pricey but worth it compared to the portions they serve you, one portion can serve my entirely family. the pasta is imported which makes a big difference to me. I got a pasta with mushroom chicken and garlic sauce which was excellent. I would go back.I never been to Sweet Tomatoes despite being extremely close to our house. Every time I drive by , it looks packed. Today I went with a friend and my son for lunch. I had a coupon, it was 20 something including drinks for both of us.  The drinks are definitely overpriced, the buffet at less than $8.00 was a decent value. I agree with a previous reviewer, the toppings for the salad were very basic, kind of disappointing. To their credit, everything looked and tasted fresh. The prepared salads were good, I'm pretty sure very high in calories as well. I had the potato leek soup, which was nothing to write home about. But.... this month they have chicken pot pie stew, you pour this on top of a biscuit and that was sooooo gooood. I'm surprised I liked it since I don't even like chicken pot pie, but the stew was nicely seasoned, the veggies were good and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Comfort food at it's best. 
The breads were OK, and the muffins were tasty. The pasta didn't looked appetizing to me at all, except the mac & cheese that my toddler devoured. Granted, at this age I don't think they're the best judges of good food, not to mention mac & cheese is a group food on its own for them.
The fruit section was very sparse, only whole apples and pineapples slices. 
In general, unless you eat a lot, buffets are not a great value but a $10 lunch here will leave you satisfied, if you're not big into meat that is. I know that I need to come back for more chicken stew and biscuits.It was pretty tasty and the prices were good. We called in our order, walked in and payed. Then waited 20 minutes until I asked where was our food. They handed me a bag that was sitting behind them the whole time so our food was now cold and not as fresh. Service is were they lacked.The gyros here are really good. Don't expect it to be hot though! I asked for cucumbers on my gyro and the woman who owns it told me they don't have it on their line but when my friend ordered a salad, she got cucumbers. they charge too much for what u get and the owner seems as stingy as can be. 
One example... She gave my friend her bag of food and when she noticed that my friend had napkins in her hand, the owner reached into her bag and took those napkins out. 

The gyro meat is great but I'd MUCH rather go to haji baba n have a much better experience and pay less!Niro's is a staple.  Quick, easy lunch that hits the spot when you're feelin like gyros.  I'm not saying it's the best gyro I've ever had, nor am I saying it's the cheapest (around $9 total), but it gets the job done.  

I usually get the single gyro meal when I go.  The fries are the thick cut super crispy kind, and the gyros are cooked well, with plenty of sauce (not sure what people are saying about it being dry, my hand's are always a mess after eating one of these), and onions and tomatoes to boot.  Great in-and-out spot if you didn't bring lunch to work on any given day.  Plus, the owner is always really nice and friendly.After hearing about this place and them having award winning pizza I was pretty hyped coming to this place. Living only a mile away, why not, right? I took my gf and it was just a leisure thursday, not alot of people there. The waitress was nice and we were seated right away, ordered the Hawaiin style pizza...  I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it, but this was OUTRAGEOUS!! It nearly took a hour to cook this pizza - I personally saw the people who came in at the same time as us - enjoy their pizza and leave!?!  
When the pizza arrived it sure didn't look properly cooked nor enticing. But I never judge a book by its cover...   so we dug in... considering all the hype I've heard about  this I expected better. Sadly I prefered pizza hut over this place that day.My husband and I went here tonight but unlike most of the reviewers, we did not order pizza.  We started off with the eggplant bruchetta which was phenomenal.  My husband got the chicken pesto which he says was the best pesto he's ever had.  I ordered the lasagne which was also very good though I will say you really have to really like ricotta cheese in order to enjoy it.  This place has great food and service and I really love the fact that they have so many microbrews on tap and wines by the glass at reasonable prices.Never been to a Boston Market?  

They basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.

Pay, sit down and eat.

I like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.

The sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.

I'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered "Welcome to BM!"  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch.Holy crap, people actually eat here?  The last several times I've been to this RA, I can gauge my level of intoxication between pretty buzzed to blackout-absolutely wasted.  As you can tell, neither I nor any of my compatriots make it a point to actually dine here, mainly drink.  That's right, awesome happy hour and on Sunday night it's Service Industry Night (aka happy hour on Sunday night).  The happy hour menu is pretty extensive with appetizers ranging from the standard california roll to gyoza, seafood dynamite, and coconut shrimp skewer things.  However, where RA truly shines is it's specials on alcohol.  Food may be ordered when the hunger arises concurrently with inebriation, but at that point it doesn't matter if it's just so-so or even sub-par (it's like having beer goggles, but for food, not chicks).  However, I can't give this place a complete crap rating because of all the wonderful drunken memories I've had here (the few times I actually remembered the outings/the first half of the outing).I come here a lot because the food is AWESOME but the service is horrible. I don't think I've ever come here without the waitress forgetting at least one part of my order. And the hostesses are somehow never at the front? I don't know. Stick to lunch and weekdays, when the place gets busy it's a real shit show.Went there a couple of weeks ago and was a little disappointed with the service. We went through 4 different servers within a matter of 10 minutes and had to ask 3 times for the little bowls for our soy sauce. We plan to go back, but hope the service is better than it previously was.I'm on my "Showgirls" diet which includes brown rice, vegetable and evian. Surprisingly, I got all of that at Neo Tokyo, with some chicken as well. 
We stopped by for lunch, and enjoyed fresh food at a very decent price. The lunch special was $6.50 and came with a spring roll. The guy working was friendly and offered some recommendations. 

I don't hang out in this part of town much, but if I'm in that part of town in the near future, I'd stop by here again without a doubt.Great cafe, wifi, etc., but I had to amend my review after going into the bathroom. It is terrible and way below the standards that the rest of the store seems to be held to. I really like the cafe and checking out the books, but that nasty bathroom really ruined the experience...Stayed here with my husband for a national conference. The resort took great care of the conferences goers. Breakfast meals were especially wholesome with lots of fruit and protein, no greasy quesadillas or deep-fried doughs. 

Saturdays were kid central with the water park, but the rest of the week was quiet and relaxing. Definitely take advantage of the adults only pool on the weekends.A bit weary an tired but a friendly and well trained staff make it all better.  The water park was fun, especially for the kids.  A good little get away for the family while visiting friends in Phoenix.I've stayed here 3 times while on business in Phoenix. Each time was a different experience. The number of stars I'd give this place varies with each experience but I'm going to settle on 3. 

I was spoiled during my first stay at the Grand. I checked in, and was given a full sized Villa room. Holy crap! This room was so nice, I was completely shocked. I didn't understand how this place could have anything but 5 star reviews. The bathroom was absolutely amazing (almost bigger than my bedroom back home!) with a huge beautifully glassed encased shower and a large Japanese soaking tub. Also had standard double sinks and plenty of towels and toiletries. The room also had a full living room and FULL kitchen. This was no kitchenette. Full sized refrigerator/freezer with ice dispenser. Dishwasher. Fully stocked with dishes, cutlery and cooking utensils (not that I would cook while there, that's what per diems are for). And then the separate bedroom. All in all, wowzers!

I also checked out the gym 2 of the 3 days on my first stay. Really nice full service gym. Plenty of cardio machines, 2 or 3 different weight room setups, and a group fitness class area. They even had some TRX ropes set up in there. I was very pleased that there was such a nice area to enjoy a morning sweat session.

Fast forward to my second visit. After the luxurious experience I had the first time around, I check in and head to my room, fully expecting the same setup. But when I walk in, I am literally shocked at the stark different between the Camelback rooms and the villas. None of the nice, modern conveinences existed here. There were 2 tube tvs (one in the small entry way living room, and one in the bedroom). The bathroom was absolutely tiny. So cramped that the toilet was crammed next to the shower and the sink was outside the bathroom. Blah. I called the front desk and was like, woah, this is definitely not the same room I stayed in last time. I was informed that on my previous visit all of the Camelback rooms were full so I had been automatically upgraded. Wish I had known that in advance so I could have reset my expectations! Because anything less than the villa was just a disappointment. Only good thing, again, was the gym (the saving grace of this hotel as others in the area don't compare).

The last time I was in Phoenix for work I decided to give the Grand one more try, hoping I would get lucky enough to be upgraded to a villa again. I halfway got my wish. I was upgraded, but not to a full villa, it was a villa guestroom. It was definitely much nicer than the Camelback rooms, no complaints there. But it was less than half the size of the full villa, the bathroom shared only a few of the qualities of the full villa that I had loved (no glass encased shower), and there was no ice in the room. The full villa had spoiled me! At least this room had a TV from this century, and it was certainly cozy enough to suffice. Again, the gym saves the day.

Given the rates my company has with this place, I'll likely be back. Hopefully I'll get to live the high life in the villas though, because the thought of slumming it in the other rooms makes me shudder.My boyfriend and I stayed for one night at this resort for a "stay-cation" and mostly picked this place because a friend had told us it was fun and nice, plus we found a good living social deal.  There were things I liked a lot, and things that needed improvement:

Things that needed improvement:
-valet service was really confusing when first pulling up
-long line to check in (but it's understandable because of the living social deal, and we were also upgraded to a room with a better view and closer to the water park)
-the entrance to get into their "water park" was the same as the exit, so it was a cluster when you going in or coming.  They should have two separate entries/exits for this to make it more effective.
-it was pretty pricey at the resort restaurant, but that's typical I guess.
-in our room: bathroom window looked directly out to the walk way, like where people are just strolling along to get to their rooms!  There was no screen or blurry glass, just a regular window and window wooden shutters.  This was bizzarre and had me nervous!  Of course you could close the shutters, but it was still weird.  Plus the shutters get soaked.

Things that I liked:
-felt like we were out of AZ, it was a very pretty property with lots of green grass and water features.
-comfortable bed (though my boyfriend disagrees! haha)
-friendly staff
-we had a great bar tender for after-dinner drinks who was friendly
-fun lazy river

the water park brings a lot of families and younger kids, so that is something to keep in mind.  There was also a nice "21 only" pool right by our room as well that was much quieter and enjoyable.

Overall, I don't know if I would go back, but I would recommend it for someone who is looking for a different hotel experience.We used the awesome deal on living social for a nights stay and tickets to the on-property water park.

The staff was very nice and pleasant at the valet and check in. The room was less than desired. As stated by other reviews the rooms seemed old and a bit dated. Why hasn't a "Grand Resort" updated every single room with a flat screen by now???? It blew my mind! The furniture and carpet also is in need of a face lift. Perhaps it was just the level room we booked with the deal but cleanliness should run across the board. 

The water park was pretty busy but we still had a blast. It was a bit confusing to enter the park because you have to enter through the store but the slides and lazy river were classic and everyone in my party enjoyed themselves. The paths at the park were horribly HOT so watch out and wear your sandals everywhere.

Overall the whole experience was just OK. If a resort boasts that it's Grand, every single room should be so, they really should do something about the outdated rooms.Kitschy.  The view is spectacular.  The smell from the bull outside as you're walking in is not.  The bull totally fits the idea - setting the scene for the old west and showing you what you're about to be eating, but the smell is far from appetizing, particularly after the "rain."  I was taken off guard when the soft-spoken server mentioned the slide, and wasn't really in the mood to try it myself, but I did see some others give it a go later.

We were promptly seated by the window, where we could get a good view of the guys who were lassoing the wooden calf out front.  It was charming to be served beer in Mason jars, even though the selection of draft beers could have been larger.  The fry bread we had while waiting for the rest of our party was good, though the chewiness indicated that it wasn't that fresh, but the cinnamon butter made up for it.  I opted for the Vaquero,a smaller steak served with cheese enchiladas.  The steak was decent, but the tortillas of the cheese enchiladas were quite chewy.  I think I should have opted for the filet, which my dining companions all got, and it came with green beans and corn.

Would I go back?  Maybe if I had kids and was passing through town.  Otherwise, I'll be looking for somewhere with more focus on the food than the theme.If you have kids, this is a great stop.  If not, you might want to re-think heading to this joint.  

As you walk in, you have a big ol steer in a pen right outside the restaurant.  The kiddies like it so its worth the smells.  Checking in with the hostess has always been an issue and it was no different this time around.  It was about a 30 minute wait for a table and a bit unorganized to get your name in with the waitress.  

If you can get a table along the windows, you will get a fantastic view of the valley, sunset and the air traffic into Sky Harbor.  Worth the trip just for the views.

Once you get buzzed that your table is ready,  you get to walk down steps or take the slide to the dining level.  The slide is a zoo with lots of kids...and some adults who act like kids...so that is part of the fun.  

Live country music and a smallish dance floor and sawdust, a classic touch.  This is not your new country music. You will get your Johnny, Willie and Waylan which is the way I like it.

Decent menu with options for the kids.  I ordered the 16 oz. Prime Rib (Marshall), medium rare.  The meal comes with bread/butter before hand.  Family style salad and cowboy beans as the first course.  And corn on the cob & green beans with the entree.  The prime rib was every bit of 16 oz, but it was over cooked.  More toward medium than MR.  That was disappointing, especially since 1/4 of the front page of the menu was taken up describing how they cook their meat.

The sides were OK.  I think they are making a mistake by serving the meal on a plate with a metal cover.  Condensation builds up on the inside of the lid and drips onto to the entree.  It just make everything soggy.

The service was good, although I had so many plates at my smallish table, that i ran out of room to put things.  For a table of four, (two of which were kids under 3) I had 9 small plates.  We had a stack of them left on the end of the table for about 10 minutes before someone stopped by to pick them up.  Just a weird experience.

There is also at least two people walking around making balloon animals, for a small fee.  These guys/gals are fun and kids certainly got a kick out of it.  

Lastly, we were offered cotton candy as we left.   Definitely something my 3yr didn't need, but it was a nice touch.   

Overall, the food was a 2, but the experience was a 4 especially for the kids....so they get a 3 from me.Loved our sever Kyle Perkins please ask for him when you come.
Every thing was good but steaks while cooked to the right temperature had no flavorI wish I could say that I was completely satisfied with my experience here. 

Positives: really neet place for kids. There is a pretty sweet slide that takes you down into the main dining area, live music in the evening, and beautiful views of the valley. So, the ambiance is fun.

Negatives: In my opinion, the food is NOT worth the price. First of all, you have to pay extra for sides like baked potato. This kind of a side is typically included at most steakhouses. They do serve bread which is super yummy. However,  the salad is a bagged salad,  not at all fresh and tastes horrible. I ordered the prime rib, I liked the seasoning but it was not medium rare as ordered. Like my vegetables, it was overcooked.  The veggies were not fresh and again, overcooked. When you pay$20 for a plate, you expect much more. Our waitress was inattentive and disappeared for a significant amount of time. There is a magician that comes around to the tables which I find annoying and uncomfortable.  I never carry cash, so I just sat there hoping he would skip us which he did.  As he passed by I got a huge whiff of cologne...nothing goes together like Old Spice and steak.  

I will say that my son enjoyed the fried chicken and my husband liked his enchilada and steak plate.  However,  we could have had better food for less at Outback. Bottom Line: you are paying for the experience, not the food. Fun to do once, but $75 was a hefty price tag for subpar food. But hey... you do get cotton candy at the end of your meal,  so that's a plus!Went to Sonic off of Arizona Ave in  Chandler Az. We ordered 2 hotdogs tots grilled chicken sandwich. They were very good at taking our order. We got our food at the parking space in less than 5 min. Hot dogs were good and chicken was ok..Food was a C+ .
Service... A... Sitting in car to eat was awkward . Had to get out of car to thru trash away.... next time we will do a drive thru.. we noticed most people do that.... 
Nice Sonic locationThe food was pretty good, and the 1-10 spicy scale they offered was helpful. Service was excellent. Naan was excellent. The only reason i won't go back is because it's too far, and there are definitely indian food places that are on the same par with this one closer to my house.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

It had been almost 15 months, so I stopped back in here, joined by Mike C., to see how they're doing.  For me, the strongest feature of this place is the small, stylish, very comfortable dining room.  It's just right!

In other ways, though, I was impressed a little less during this visit than before.  We have so many excellent choices here in the Valley, & certain things didn't measure up to the best:

*  The food selection here was slightly small (for an Indian or Pakistani Buffet), with 19 items (counting the salad items separately).

*  The chicken used in the Tandoori Chicken here this time seemed low grade.

*  At many of these Buffets, you come away raving about how good the Chicken Tikki Masala was.  I didn't find that to be the case with this dish here.

*  The table service was proper but not friendly.  Yes, this is the case at about half of the Indian & Pakistani Buffets, but at some, such as India Grill, Kabab & Curry, & even Copper Kettle (since he moved to the new location) they're so graceful & nice that it adds to the pleasure of dining there.     :-)

With all that said, I do still think this is an "OK" dining choice, & it's 3 Stars this time for Star of India, where the weekday Lunch Buffet is $9.99.A good above-average sandwich that I would probably enjoy more often if I had more reason to be in that part of town.  The radius of their sandwiches are ideal for eating as they aren't too wide, too tall,  or too sloppy.  The meats are good cuts and generous, their bread being the only real weak link.I had the mushroom cheese steak sandwich and it was ok but not great. I split my sandwich in half so I could eat the rest later and I'm just not that excited about finishing it. It could just be that I'm not a huge fan of greasy food. I would probably not go here again.The sandwiches were made to order, the aroma of the food cooking on the hot grill teasing my nostrils, this place is legit.

You get to choose most of the sandwiches from Small, Medium, and Large.  I ordered Mediums, thinking of Subway ... but the sandwiches were much bigger.  They say the medium is 12" long, but they seem longer than subways 12" (hey, no laughing)

Ordered several sandwiches:
Capastrami
Cran-Slam Club
Chicken Cheese Steak
Homemade Meatball Sub

Demanding a bite of each, the two that I liked a lot were the Capastrami & the Cran-Slam Club.  The Capastrami had thick tender slices of hot pastrami that was full of flavor, had a nice pink color, and wasn't dripping with oil (like some places).  The Cran-Slam club had fresh slow-roasted Turkey that was super moist and delicate, not dry and brittle.

I heard that they will be opening locations near my house which is good.  Once that happens, I won't be as jealous about my cousins living so close to this location.Food was good, but for the price i expected a little more. I ordered for takeout.  It tasted much the same as any other Chinese restaurant too me.  They didn't have any kid sized meals, so I had to pay the full-sized $12.95 just to get my daughter her teriyaki chicken, which is sort of dumb.

I probably won't go back just because I think I can get the food I want elsewhere for less. 

I will say it was clean and nicely decorated, so if you want to dine in then it would be worth it.The wine was okay, food was decent, but the service was blah! The waiter treated us like we didn't belong. I've in place more upscale than this and didn't receive such poor treatment.It's Cracker Barrel. I haven't eaten there for years, at least 8 or more.
We ordered take out last week.
Husband said to give excellent feedback based on the manager fixing a problem with our order.
4 stars for  the manager
-1star for the chicken fried steakI'm praying that Malee's on Main is much better because the location at Desert Ridge really doesn't do it for me. The menu is great but I get the feeling that everything is just a variation. It doesn't seem to be authentic Thai by any stretch but instead a fusion of various Asian cuisines. That's not to say the food isn't good, it's very good, but just uninspired.I really like their thin crust pizzas. Parking at this location can be a pain.Good food- but over priced! For the price, I expect more food to be on my plate. Can't go wrong with the pizzas and pastas.I admit that I don't drink beer.  And yes, this is a brewery.  I've heard they have good beer, but what I'm reviewing now is their food.  

And their 'appetizer' food is pretty darn amazing. (Although expensive as chain food goes)

I can heartily recommend their pub tips (beef in a nice thick brown sauce with mash potatoes).

And if you stay even just a short while (to enjoy a cold one or something) you have to at least try their Asiago cheese dip.  I've had this several times with my wife, and it's amazing.  It's served warm, with bits of small sliced bread to dip in the sauce.  It compliments a quiet conversation quite nicely.

They have bar seating with TVs, or quieter 'booth' seating that is more appropriate for families or quiet dates with your significant other.  

If you like people watching (and it's cool out) they have outdoor seating that faces the interior of Desert Ridge, and also has nice views of a fountain.

They may have a line in the evenings, but it's generally worth the wait.Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok.
I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. 
Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten.

p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak.Brian Helton is the brewmaster here, and he probably makes the best beer of all the Rock Bottom locations in Phoenix.  By this I mean the seasonal offerings, and his are top notch.  This Rock Bottom location has his amazing milk stout instead of the less than spectacular stout served at other locations.

Food has gone downhill over the years as they've tried to improve the menu.  It all started with removing the asiago cheese dip, then bringing it back, then removing it again.  They ditched the portabello on ciabatta, which was my regular entree with fries.  Bad move.

Some of the appetizers are unique and worthwhile.  Happy hour isn't such a great deal.  Mug club has good perks for early on in your visits, but once you're passed the early rewards there's little to look forward to.  I have 100+ visits and it's just not fun any longer.This is my first visit to an In-n-Out Burger & it was a bit unique for a fast food joint. Quite nice on the inside with a VERY limited menu. We had the Double Double Cheeseburgers which were good (i.e., better than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.) but not as good as Five Guys or Carl's Jr. The fries were nice and fresh & unsalted.

A fun place to visit, but only occasionally.there oj not fresh anymore that sucks!!!!!!!!!+s
Love the bagels, coffee (bottomless and amazing) and sandwiches (whooaaa!!)
Great service, often bringing your food to your table...
Seasonal menu additions...
Ambiance is great with a nice open feeling inside and patio outside...

-s
Close early (not open in the evenings)
Not laptop friendly. Wifi is good most of the times, but no power outlets
A little bit pricey
This location can get crowded at certain times on the weekends (the staff still does an amazing job)This review is for the gas station here.  I don't come to this area often, but we have friends who live nearby.  This is the closest gas station to their home and when we drive back home, we often need to fill up.  The lanes are wide and well lit at night.  It's a Shell, so plan to pay more than most other gas stations.

Return Factor - 50%I really wanted to LOVE Roy's, but it just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  I left feeling very "meh."

My husband and I were staying at the JW with a Travelzoo deal, and we had been wanting to try Roy's since we live very close anyway, but never had the chance.  So we figured why not.  We were greeted and seated right on time in a very private booth indoors.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside, but everyone was outside and we wanted a more romantic dinner rather than having to listen to everyone else's conversations and screaming kids.  

Our server was really great - knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing, and I wish I could remember his name.  We started with our drinks...my husband ordered his typical Jack and Diet and I ordered a glass of wine.  I wasn't impressed with the wine menu, however, as I was trying to decide between two different glasses, our server brought me tastes of both options, which was a really nice touch.  

We had the lobster potstickers for an appetizer, which I really enjoyed.  However, as others have mentioned, the portions are very small for what you are paying.  I rolled my eyes at those reviews before I dined here, but having experienced it now, I can confirm that really, they are small.  It wouldn't have bothered me if I paid $15 for 3 bites and those bites were the most amazing flavors I've ever tasted, but that was not the case.  

Moving on to dinner - I ordered the Roy's Trio, which included 2.5 oz servings of the salmon, mahi, and butterfish, and some rice.  Again, very small portion.  Although I was satisfied with the amount of food, my husband was not.  I like the butterfish very much and wished I had ordered that as my entree.  The other two were just "meh" as far as flavor for me.  My husband had the Ahi and he liked it but didn't love it (story of the evening).

We finished with the chocolate lava cake.  Great decision.  It was soooo good.  We aren't big chocolate people, but it just sounded good that night and boy are we glad we ordered it.  SO YUMMY.

I would have really liked Roy's if they had been priced just a little lower - I don't think my entree was worth paying more than $25 or so.  I have spent the same amount of money on the same amount of food (appetizer to share, entrees, dessert to share) at much nicer restaurants, which is really what is holding me back from liking Roy's more.  I would tell people to try it for yourself, but for us, it was fine but just didn't live up to expectations.Good food when it's slow. Not so good when super busy. This is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the Harkins theater nearby. If the lot is full on a Friday or Sat night I would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed. Although the service there has always been pretty good for us, the food is hit and miss.When we are in the mood for appetizers, we often think of the Elephant Bar.  

A couple appetizers we like to order are the coconut shrimp and the shrimp & crab cakes, although I've had much better crab cakes but they're pretty good.  The tempura salmon roll is always a nice addition to our appetizer line-up as well.  

The Elephant Bar has a nice variety and we always enjoy what we order.  Service is good and the food comes out of the kitchen quickly and is always served hot.2.5 stars.  Wok-Fired Chicken and Lettuce Wrap was really good, but everything else was blah.  Artichoke dip was like melted american cheese.  Chicken marsala was dry and didn't have a simple marsala sauce (not a good choice on my part, but I figured it's a simple dish, so would be a safe item.  Lesson learned!)  Not sure what we had for dessert, but it was a small scoop of ice cream buried in a ton of whipped cream.  Loud.  Server was good about refilling water.although i gave 3 stars i would go back.  tea lite is close to me so an easy choice to start my pho adventure.  liked the combo that included pho, egg rolls and a spring roll.  nice variety and just the right portion.  i always get pho with seafood but they don't offer it so i was bummed about that.  ordered the beef and liked the taste plus it wasn't salty like some places i've tried.  the combo was about $7 so very reasonably priced.Tea Lite Cafe offers a massive amount of food quick and cheap.   While the food is plentiful, it's still pretty light.  You'll be quite full after eating at Tea Lite, but you won't have that slickly heavy feeling that comes with over indulging in most fast food.  It's a great place to stop in before or after hitting up a movie right next door.

My problem with Tea Lite is the lack of variety in its flavor.  The cilantro in each dish sticks out (not a problem for me but I do know plenty of people that dislike cilantro), but every dish pretty much tastes the same.  The small menu basically offers chicken, beef, or pork as a Pho, Bun or sandwich.  The Pho tasted like the Bun only with brought and a touch of spice from jalapeño.  With the acceptation of the dipping sauce, the Vegetarian Spring Rolls tasted like Bun and Pho, only with the added rubbery texture of the clear rice paper (the tofu tastes just like the chicken).  The hot sauce that's served on the side of the entrees is very good and hot.I've always enjoyed Tea Light, and I've been coming here every so often since around 2006/7. In the early stages of my family and I frequenting this place, the food was amazing. Sometimes, we'd even be there two or three times a week (yikes on the sodium intake). 

Now, however, I find that the quality and taste of the food has dropped off a bit. I'm not sure if they have changed their Pho recipes, or if there has been a change in the person cooking the food, but now it is just so-so. Their prices are alright. Definitely nothing compared to the place I'm always going to now near Central Ave and 19th. The service is decent. But like I said the food is just good- nothing exceptional (At least now).

Tips to the owners would be to make the Tea Light Special available for take-out and bring back the Spicy Beef Soup with Udon noodles (this was the dish that had me craving this place multiple times a week)!!!!When is Land Rover fast? When they're processing my payment. When do they take their sweet time? The remainder of the time. BTW, that free coffee is gonna cost you.The food here is pretty good.  We had the steamed dumplings appetizer, an order of the Thai Curry and an order of Mu Shu Pork.  The Pork was the clear winner here.  
Service wasn't great and it wasn't terrible.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating but we felt really rushed and had to flag people down for water, forks, etc.  
Ever since my husband and I traveled to China last year we've been searching for a restaurant in Phoenix that serves honest-to-goodness-Shanghai-style Xiaolongbao steamed dumplings (bamboo steamer, yummy soupy-pork filling, etc), but alas, the search continues....these are the standard issue half-moon shaped pot stickers filled with chicken.  Damn you, American palates!  They were just okay.  If I ordered them again I'd definitely go with the pan-fried option for a little texture.  
Nice modern interior.  If you're in the area, definitely check it out.... I just don't know if I'd drive out of my way for it.The Coach store was packed a many bags were half off. Nike was cool and the luggage store had great deals. Go across the street for a brunch or lunch break at Cafe Aroma to recharge and shop more. The Levi Outlet had awrsome deals and face it...their jeans last forever so you can't beat that!I am once again on the road for work and staying in Anthem, AZ.  There is nothing here, so the restaurant finds are slim pickins'.  My team and I visited "Famous" Rays Pizza since it was right behind our hotel and for pizza it was okay... how can you screw up Pepperoni pizza?  The boys went for the hoagies and the lasagna - each received two thumbs up since they were stuffing their face.  Bread sticks a little bland, but the bread that came out with the lasagna was the best.  
More people carrying out the pizza than dining in.My boyfriend loves loves loves this places pizza.

To be quite honest yes its good enough for 9.99 mon-wed for 1 topping. I refuse to spend more than that here unless my bf is craving it.  Personally id rather go to bashas down the street for 6.99 for pepperoni pizza freshly made when you call.  So far i still have yet to find a pizza joint where i LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza so much that i crave it. I don't know exactly what it is that i do not love this place just as much as my boyfriend... the grease maybe? i am not a huge fan of drippy pizza. i do not care about the stretchy cheese not being real thing i just want pizza with awesome flavor. If we don't get bashas i am okay with this as long as it was only 9.99. Have not tried any of their calzones or wings, someday i will though. Skip the fried zucchini and mushrooms not that great here.It's been over a year since I reviewed this nice Pakistani buffet, so it seemed time to come give Grumpy Uncle & his nice restaurant another try.  Also, since my last visit, his sister's place, which would be Surly Auntie's Copper Kettle in Tempe, has closed.  That's too bad, as I really liked the cozy little place, & it was closer to home for me.

Ok, so Jeromy H. joined me for this outing, & the upside for me in dining here today was that this Copper Kettle continues to offer a nicely decorated, clean dining room featuring somewhat unusual South Asian buffet foods, including beef, which of course you wouldn't see at an Indian buffet.  Also, the low price of $8.50 remains the same as it was before.

On the negative side, the rice & the Tandoori Chicken were both a little blah, & there were empty, unused trays at the serving table.  This is not ok, & Uncle should have at least put out a few slices of Bell Pepper or whatever in the otherwise unused trays.  You don't just leave them sitting there empty.

This is still an "OK" place, & a regular menu is offered, but no alcohol, in keeping with Islam.I had done a review last night due to 
Banner Desert Medical Center I should add some of the good things that went on too. when I was being checked at the ER, they were very quick in calling us up for evaluation in that time they had found I was in AFIB which can be very dangerous if not treated. and by the time I was finished with insurance documation, etc i believe i was taken right to the back for the DR.. to check me out. so there is a rainbow at the end of the tunnel. Some of the nursing staff and doctors were very efficient too, so they override the bad.  my Pharmacy DR.. and my other DR that came in daily were very patient in explaining things to me .  I think if the rough edges get taken care of maybe this could be an enjoyable place to be despite why we have to go to the hospital.  THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP IS CLEANING THE ROOMS TOP TO BOTTOM, LIKE THE FOOD TRAYS ALL THE MEDAL ON THE LEGS OF THE IV WHEELIES, ETC. AND UNDER ALL THE BEDS ALL THE METAL AROUND THE FIXTURES, THIS MIGHT TAKE TIME AT FIRST BUT IF DONE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND UPKEEP DAILY THAT WOULD DO IT.  NOTHING LIKE THE SMELL OF PINE SOL AND LYSOL WHEN YOU ENTER YOUR STERILE ROOM AND DON'T FORGET  ALL THE REMOTES IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE 12 MIN. FOR EACH ROOM AND BATHROOM TO DO IF YOU HAVE AN EFFICIENT EMPLOYEE. well i want to thank you for hearing me out and wish you luck in up-keeping the rooms i am sure i will be back. 

Pam PDuuuuuuuudeee.....this place is YUM.  Where are my eye drops?

Definitely an interesting crowd.  Makes me want to grab my Birkenstocks, hacky sack, and drum and hitch hike right back up to Flagstaff.

But really...the sandwiches rule!!!!  

The service and pricing...nothing special (neither great nor poor.)

Environment...this is a fun place to eat and people watch.  You should try it.It was ok.  I wanted to like it more.  We found it on YELP while my daughter was in the hospital at Cardon's.  She wanted egg drop soup which, by the way, was very good (little too much tofu for me).  My wife liked the hot and sour soup and the crab puffs were good.  Egg roll was a little mushy.  Portions were small considering, but prices were very reasonable ($5.15 for lunch special).  The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is that there is no orange chicken on the lunch menu and the sweet and sour pork I got had some nasty fat chunks in half of the pieces I got.  One I had to spit out into my napkin because I couldn't chew it up.  Even with that said, I would probably try it again because everything else was good and the price was fair.Pretty good  Japanese food. One of the few real Japanese restaurants in the area. Can't believe they've been here since 1983, but You can kinda feel the history when you enter. You may feel hesitant to go in at first, (since no other customer is there... ) but don't let that hold you back. Try it and you'll like it. I wish I could give out 3 and a half. will definitely come back.Nice lunch menu...I cannot review for dinner, I haven't been back to this place for over 5 years....my most recent trip was for lunch, the menu is extensive and great pricing.When traveling to this region, this has become a standard for us in being easily accessible, having the products we're usually looking for, best in quality and excellent customer service.A timeless classic a place with more shows than I can / care to remember.

Seen a lot of up and coming people here as well as some pretty good regular nights as well.
Always an interesting collection of different music styles mixed in with a ton of talents of all sorta both local and elsewhere.

Cheap drinks and plenty of pool tables.
Old school video games and of course darts
Pizza and bar food that is actually decent!Sound is decent to good. The earps rock.I have been living here for almost two years now, when my husband and I first moved in it was great! Everyone in the office was awesome and the maintenance workers really cared. Since Greystar has taken over they are giving incentive to let inconsiderate tenants move in. I have been dreading living here since then. I have complained time and time again about hood rat kids with their subwoofers, drug dealers making deals in broad daylight in front of me! I was flabbergasted when I first saw this happen! Don't get me wrong, the inside of the apartments are very nice, new sinks, stove,refrigerator, and new microwave. Since the management has taken over the new maintenance workers half ass work, the people in the office are rude ( they also have a lady that cannot properly dress, she looks like she's going to the club in her hoochie clothes, instead wearing business attire.) I for one would not recommend this place, they are about to raise the rent to $675.00 a month! This is not worth it! Find somewhere else!I went to the Best Western at Dobson Ranch Inn for Spring Training this year and was pleasantly surprised that all the staff was very helpful. There was a free complimentary breakfast, which was delicious, there is a large outdoor pool and hot tub, and the rooms were nice and clean and big as well. My mother and I really enjoyed our stay and would come back the next time we travel to Arizona for Spring Training. I would say though that it gets a little noisy in the night.I used to come here about once a week solid for 2 years. I obviously liked the place. It was always consistently yummy but I've found that if you plan on going, it's best to time it. Either come right before the church crowd gets out, or a couple hours after, otherwise you could be waiting for quite awhile. They have a free coffee station outside when it gets packed, so at least you can drink some hot coffee while you wait. 

I've always enjoyed the Chilaquiles (don't think they have that on the menu anymore) and the Nurse's Bialy Breakfast- 3 egg whites w/ turkey, spinach, onion, and tomato with a toasted bialy and cream cheese. I used to be fond of their fried breakfast potatoes but for me, I'm finding them too greasy and usually make my stomach hurt, even though they taste great. 

If you ask, your server will refill your drink and put it in a to-go cup when you're done with your meal. That's always cool.While at Fiesta Mall with my son who was getting his hair cut we decided to eat. We wondered around the food court and was approached by an employee of Sarku Japan offering free samples of their teriaki chicken. After trying it my son just had to order from there.  The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.  He ordered the teriaki chicken & shrimp. The amount of food that he got was way more than expected and he was happy it tasted like what it was suppose to. 
A definate place we'll visit in again and highly recommend!!Your typical bowling alley.  Cocktails are about $3.50, glow bowling on saturday nights.  They have a package for 6 people for like 65 bucks.. Includes your shoe rental and 2 hours of bowling.. oh, and a pitcher of soda.  The shoes are clean.  The bar is clean, the lanes are clean, and even the bathroom was clean.  Do not underestimate how much money a bar tab can be... 2 different friends racked up over 100 dollar checks in about 3 hours.. maybe 3.5..  Anyway, I liked this place and will return for sure... but maybe because I bowled 168 woot woot!Your basic Denny's alternative.  Not fantastic, but lives up to it's own not-so-lofty standard, if that makes sense.  Not as risky as hitting a Waffle House at 3am, though just as hazardous to your health, if you choose unwisely from the rather extensive breakfast menu.  Predictibly decent - seems to never excel, nor disappoint.The food and service is OK, but the free Wi-Fi is a great bonus for those late night study/eat cravings.Iv been coming here on and off for a couple of years so that should tell you what kind of a restaurant it is, you wouldn't come out of your way to come here but if you happen to be closer by and are craving some Arabic/med/greek food then this place is pretty good. Portions are a bit on the small side, which is unusual for the kind of restaurant that it is. What pisses me off is that the don't have unlimited lamb shanks in their buffet anymore, which kinda defeats the purpose of a buffet. Now you can only get one per buffet, and it was the only thing that you could convince your brain to cough up 10 something bucks for the other things are ehh. You're better off ordering something from their menu, the things on there are actually good.On our first night in Phoenix, after flying in from Savannah, we opted to stay in, relax, unwind, and get caught up with daughter/step daughter, son-in-law/step son-in-law and granddaughter, Izabel. We had not seen each another in over a year. Take out Chinese seemed like the perfect way to fill our bellies with a minimum amount of effort or interruption of our family social objectives. Upon consulting Yelp reviewers and looking at the map, we easily settled on Golden Gate. We were not looking for gourmet or exotic, just good old fashioned take out. 

If it isn't already obvious however, we were hungry. Our order included egg rolls, crab angels, fried dumplings, kun po shrimp, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, moo shu pork and both white and brown rice. Every choice was well received although the crab angels, dumplings and Mongolian beef received the highest marks. One person thought the moo shu was too runny and would have benefited from more pork. Another commented that the chicken could have had more veggies while a third remarked that they liked the way the chicken and its sauce were packaged separately, thus preventing the fried meat from getting soggy. All in all, this was a very satisfying meal, with tons of leftovers, and all for just $56.60. 

An excellent way to enjoy the first evening of our long weekend in Phoenix.I have no idea why I keep returning to this place, it really isn't great or fancy.  Last night I didn't even like the salsa, and the chips seemed stale.  I had a pork burro, very very very very very salty.  Yikes!  And I a usually the one who uses the salt shaker.  I guess it is convenient to meet a friend, but something has got to give here.  One more shot then I will possibly have to move on.  Oh, and did I mention that they didn't even offer us a refill on the chips?  they gave us an extra salsa but whatcha gonna do with extra salsa?  It was ok, just not great...I had the opportunity to check this place out as a music venue/bar when my buddies of MIssion G were performing this past weekend.

I have to agree with Koli, the prices for the 'dive-sh' scene the place would be pegged as, has a lil higher prices then expected but all in all my tab was definitely still cheaper than another regular bar.

My one major disappointment with the venue would be that they don't handle liquor. Only beer and wine. Now I like wine don't get me wrong, but when I'm rocking out to a hardcore show, balancing the wine glasses is the furthest thing from my mind. 

Otherwise the people were pretty cool, the bartender girl was super nice and helpful, even shook my hand and introduced herself. And the overall crowd was all good company.I went on a Saturday and was the first one there.

A friendly lady welcomed us and sat us in a teppanyaki table. A family of four showed up and shared the table with us.

We had edamame, veggie tempura, and shrimp and filet lunch.

We could skip the tempura.

The food was good, above average but nothing impressive.

The down part is that the chef barely did an effort to impress. I like to go to that kind of places for the show since I'm pretty picky when it comes to Japanese food. And if there's no show at all... 

Also the bidding feels old. It feels like going into a 1980's restaurant (I guess that's what they fueled back in the day, I'll ask my grand ma, ha ha).

Decent food, decent prices, no show (at least in my visit)Typical chain mexican food. I knew what i was walking into.It's a gym. It is what it is. It is there for what I need. Which is a place to be less lazy. For that I love it. I've been a member for a few weeks. I'm going every other day and most days I have no issue getting on a machine. It can get really packed, the place isn't huge. 

There is a ladies workout room which I really like. If I can't jump on a machine in the main area I can usually find one in there. 

All in all, I have yet to have a bad experience here so I like the place. Staff seems pretty friendly as well. 

I'll keep paying $20 a month for now.This location is not closed! I will write another review after visit later this evening!None of us got "ice cream"! Ordered a smoothie, the small is ridiculously small, order a medium. The sorbet is good. I ordered the No Fair a Funnel Cake, took about 6 minutes to get. Do not order from employee Krishna, this guy has looks to kill and is one pissed off mean employee!!Great food. However, 5 USD for one meatball is a little bold!I came here Friday night with some friends and have to say, its not so bad.  It's been A VERY long time since I have been to an old country buffett....the old out of sight out of mind syndrome.

We went for dinner service, and foro the 3 of us to eat, with drinks it was about $37.  Ouch.  I was expecting it to be about $30 for all of us, but it was a few dollars more then we had expected.  No big deal really, just wasn't planning on spending almost $40!  Not bad though.

I have to say, they had quite a selection.  They had several different buffets going, and many dishes that looked good.  They even had a grill area that had a chef guy cutting food....nice!  I got a little bit of steak, and it was tasty.  yummy.

Anyways, not such a bad place.  Will probably be back in the future!Let's be honest. You don't go here for the food. You don't go here to be waited on. You go here to play a game, or to drop your kids off so they can play. Sure, if you are having a birthday party there you expect to be waited on a *bit* more, but to expect falling-all-over-you service is just unrealistic in these establishments. It was fun, the kids had a good time, and the birthday party went smoothly. That's all you need.Better than average Asian food for a take-out restaurant. Get their crab angels though. DELICIOUS!Panda Express seems to be close to the same everywhere. It's good for fast food and close to where I live. Clean, fast, and inexpensive, but not unique.It was $20 to neuter my male cat, they require you to pay $15 for pain medication, but they DO NOT give you a cone for the cat, it was an extra $30, which I was upset about seeing as you are told to keep the cat from licking down there for 5 days. I do sleep! I do have a job! I can't watch him 24/7. 

The line was preeeeetty long, too, to drop him off and to pick him up, but for the price I paid, it wasn't bad.

Also, when I finally got him home, the entire back half of him was soaking wet with water. I called back and they said they must not have had time to dry him seeing as I came sooner than expected (they give you a time frame from 4-5 to pick up your cat and I came at 4:30, I'm not exactly sure how that's sooner than expected). There is a little red bubble like thing coming out of my cat's ballsack, which I also asked about. They said it was normal, but I could come back in to sew it up better (my bf did not want to go, he said he was fine, so we didn't end up going). 

All in all though, I'm happy with the price I paid. If anyone else wants that price, go to catnipandtuck.org !They are pretty good. Some times you have to really pay attention to make sure they do a good job. I really like Trina or Fawn. They up charge you for using your credit card, which I'm not sure is legal....Only $1 off drinks during happy hour?  Boo!  Why did they change it?  They have a decent wine list and a nice looking bar and patio but I just can't stand places that don't have good drink specials during happy hour.  That is the whole point.  Duh!  Oh well, at least their tasty appetizers are half off.We have a love hate relationship with Organ Stop Pizza.  It's great for unique entertainment and is always a sure bet to entertain company with but, their pizza isn't very good.  It's ok when it first hits your table (watch for your number because you have to pick it up) but if you let it sit for more than 10 min, it's terrible.  Good thing they have a salad bar, ice cream and alcohol to soothe your pizza worries. Still, the organ player is amazing in his playing and talking to the crowd.  We'll continue to go there every year or so but would probably go more often if the pizza was just a little better.  Oh yeah, make sure you request your song before you get your pizza so that you'll have a chance to hear it!  And tip him.Just a standard target. Nothing special.I enjoy stopping by this joint once in a while since they have such a variety of burgers to try from elk, beef, turkey, buffalo, chicken, and more. This time I got the turkey burger on a whole wheat bun with potato wedges. One of the best turkey burgers I have had since it once a ground turkey patty with no grease. I would recommend for those that enjoy a good turkey burger!First off, I am not a big fan of the "just for u" savings. In our busy lives, who has time to go on the app just to load "extra" savings on our card. Why not just let us have the discount via store flyer coupons, or everyday low price? Nothing's more annoying than shopping, spending over $50-$100 each visit, and seeing the savings I could have had if I added the savings on my card. I do not have the time. Considering the extreme amount of marketing Safeway does, since I know personally I receive a SW paper weekly, they should save some of their marketing money, and give us the consumers better discounts. Secondly, evertime I shop this SW, I find expired product. Many times they are discounting food that will be expiring in one to two days. How is that allowed? Seems a little sneeky, and unsafe to me at the same time. Especially their salads. Thirdly, they really should consider some sort of employee appreciation party of sorts, because evertime I go into this SW, no one is smiling, and the cashiers in ALL departments can be quite rude, and complain about their day. I don't know about you, but after a long day at work the last thing I want to do is shop somewhere and hear about people complaining about their jobs and how long they've been working and how they can't afford anything. Lastly, they really need more baskets, and cleaning supplies to wipe carts, etc. As well as a clear gas discount expiration date on their receipts!I've been going to this Denny's for many, many years. I have never had a bad meal here but I have had a couple of crappy servers. A lot of times their servers don't know things they're supposed to know such as what's on special, substitutions, what comes with what etc...the only servers I will deal with there are the experienced ones that I know are competent and know what they're doing. There is one particular server at this place that I avoid like the plague; she is a total dud and is the rudest person ever. She doesn't need to be named LOlMy first and second experience have not been that great.  I had to come here because of treatment in progress and the other office on Ocotillo unexpectedly closed.  The dentist is nice, however this offices communication is not great.  They made me an appoint and then I sat for 2 hours because they could not get my information from the Ocotillo office that closed.  My 21 y/o son brought my 14 y/o son in for his checkup/cleaning (the 21 y/o has guardianship), I had the day before explained this to the office staff that called to confirm the appt. and to ask about what forms I would need since I was not there.  When the boys got to the office it was a hassle for them to be seen, the office wanted me the parent there, did not believe my eldest had guardianship, they wanted proof.  It did get worked out and my youngest was seen, but again had to wait almost 2 hrs to get it worked out. Angie the hygienest is fantastic (from Ocotillo office) and she just might be the only one that keeps me going back.  I will continue treatment here as it is in progress, but might find another dentist if they don't work out their office issues.The food is very good. I gave 3 stars due to price. It's a bit over priced for the food and portion size. One visit I did the bowl which includes rice an chicken etc. The scoop of rice was too small and not that much meat. They need to lower their prices a couple dollars or give more food. If you don't mind over paying a small amount, then go. The food is good.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be campy, and it was, but there also was a good amount of production involved in the live music show.  

There were several other acts (hoop dancer, magic show, gun fight) going on through the evening that each performer venue directed the crowd to (and kept the night moving), but the real gem here is the main music show.  

I'm amazed that this family is still doing their show, and it is incredible.  A musician myself, I'm usually leery of such acts, but their band had a magnetic energy (and playful onstage banter), Big Jim and Sweet Mary can still SANG and their fiddler rivals the speed of light!  Very tight harmonies, a medley of moving patriotic songs & spirituals, and a healthy amount of crowd interaction.  

The band serves you through the dinner line, engaging visitors when the line lulls.  It is a humbling realization when you see them up on stage after dinner doing their thing.  They ran out of chicken about 2/3 of the way through the line and gave out ice cream vouchers to those people.  However, even without the chicken, they fill your plate.  I did not leave hungry.  

I bought 2 vouchers through BuyWithMe for "2 VIP tickets for a barbecue buffet, ice cream, and high-energy stage show" for $40 (so, $20/person).  According to their website that should include "VIP Seating / Includes Chicken and Beef Combo Meal" and costs $36 per person.  What actually happened: it was not a buffet, but cafeteria style - one run through, one serving of each.  We did not receive ice cream vouchers with our dinner tickets, and did not receive VIP seating, unless if everyone else used the same VIP seating vouchers, and we were just four rows back in the VIP seating (out of five rows total).  So, that was disappointing.  I don't think it's worth the full admission price.  I enjoyed it, yes, but, even for the novelty of the show, I'd cap the adult price at $20.

Overall, though, it's a good place to bring the kids.  They successfully recreated a completely different era for children (and adults) to lose themselves in, and get some history at the same time.  There is a lot of standing for acts other than the dinner/stage show, so not the best option for older folks or those with back problems.  Also, you'll enjoy it more if you choose a cooler month - only the stage show/dinner is inside.

My final word?  It was worth the voucher price and was a nice alternative to the standard dinner and a movie.  If I go again and bring the kids, we'll pop in just for the dinner/show and leave afterwards.I find it amazing that the separation of only 110 miles between Tucson and Phoenix causes the difference between the mexican food to be so drastic. This place isn't bad so let me first say that. But it is so far from the Mexican food in Tucson that I kinda felt disappointed. I felt like being in Arizona the Mex food would be equal but it sure isn't I enjoyed my food and had my Mexican fix but it wasn't nearly as good as I assumed it would be. I think next time I'll stay away from the Machaca and get some enchiladas or something.Putting my Mexican restaurant rule to the test, I promised my self I would not judge this place , or any place, until the chips and salsa came out. My rule is (and it almost NEVER fails me) if the chips and salsa aren't good, the food won't be good. Stale, store-bought chips= entrees made with canned, processed ingredients- not fresh ones. Flavorless, ketchup-like salsa= flavorless food you would be better off buying pre-made at the grocery store. Try it out, it works!

After being served our chips and salsa and taking my first eager bite, my conclusion was: Not bad. Not amazing, but not bad. In fact, I only visited this place a week ago and I hardly even rememeber it. That's the kind of impression it made on me. I ordered the Machaca which I usually love, but this seemed to be lacking the flavor and texture I was looking for. The rice and beans aren't bad, but again, not amazing. 

I would recommend this place to people afraid of Mexican food- those that rarely eat it and never venture far away from a ground beef taco. However, if you are like myself and could eat Mexican food all day every day, I would recommend you skip this place and look for the nearest run-down, mom & pop, been-around-for-50-years, Nana still in the kitchen, local kind of place.Read some reviews before coming here so I knew it would be hit or miss. The experience wasn't amazing but I wasn't disappointed.

My meal consisted of a bean tostada, cheese enchilada, and a beef taco. I don't remember what the the combo was called but I was having a hard time making up my mind and figured some variety would be nice. The taco was good, the beef was shredded and a had a lot of black pepper. The cheese enchilada was good but I prefer my enchiladas real saucy. I didn't finish the tostada because I didn't really like the shell.

The kids got chicken fingers with fries and said the fries were no good. I think there were only three little chicken fingers in the meal.

The best part of the meal was the waitress. She let us know about a promotion that is going on where you go online, get the phrase of the day, say it and you get a free food item. The day we went it was flautas and we each got a free one. We ordered two beef and one chicken. They were good. The food item changes daily.

I may or may not be back. With all of the Mexican food choices around here I will probably choose an establishment that I haven't yet tried.You don't go here for the food, you go here because it gives the kids something to do inside.  I love to come on a weekday, first thing in the morning with a good book. I order pizza and let the kids play while I read. Perfect for the last days of summer when its 115* out.I like Outback.  Generally speaking, it serves a decent filet for a chain restaurant.  The Aussie cheese fries and the wings are consistently good.  That said, this particular Outback was a disappointment when it came to the steaks.  The spice coating was overpowering plus the meat tended to be on the overcooked side and dried out.  

Still, in all fairness, the service was friendly and attentive---no complaints there.It's a Burger King like any other.  I prefer their reheated "flame broiled" burgers over McD's.  It's serves it's purpose and it's on our way from Big League Dreams to the US60.I used to eat at Tom's years back, and coming back here for lunch, everything's pretty much the same.  They do have the new addition of sugar free bbq sauce, which is very nice.  The burgers are decently sized and satisfying, and the fries are a perfect addition to eat with it.  The Italian beef sandwich, compared to others I've had in Arizona, is a good value, but I don't think it's necessarily the best Italian beef here.  The sandwich automatically comes with peppers which is nice, and is full dipped for you.  The broth was a little saltier than say, Lobby's, and there wasn't as much beef in the sandwich, although the beef itself seemed more tender.

The last time I ate their bbq sandwiches was years back, so I'll have to come here again to try out their bbq items.I'm guilty of eating at this place a time or two before but this time it was lucky enough to be full from lunch & meeting a colleague to handle business. Families-it's got a playground for ya. It's always looked a little rundown (to me) so I can only assume that's why they're doing a renovation. No drive thru for the time being so if your in a hurry skip to the next one. There is access tho on the north side so if this is your jam good luck on parking. I'm sure I'll post another review after the renovation is complete. Food wise.....well it's McDonalds, eat at your own risk, hahahahaThe food was excellent.   The service was very good as well.   The only reason I gave them 3 or of 5 stars is because of the wait for a table.   The restaurant was only half full and we waited for over an hour to be seated.   There is no excuse for this.Any Home Depot is generally the same regardless of where it is, my go to place when working on a home improvement project. They seem to have the best prices of any local hardware stores and pretty solid warranties on larger products.
A year or so ago I would say this location was pretty reliable on pricing and we could usually find someone to help us when taking on a home project we knew absolutely nothing about. Maybe we just don't have that wide eyed look of horror of first time home buyers like we did months ago so we don't elicit the same pity help. Or maybe Home Depot is getting more ridiculously short staffed every day. The last few times we gone to this location we have walked around aimlessly for twenty minutes trying to find someone to help us get something off a shelf or check stock availability. When we did find one frazzled lady who was talking with people in the tile section, there were 3 other people hovering around her waiting to ask her something. We gave up and left empty handed. The place was a ghost town on a Saturday morning, guess we found out why.

If I didn't have to schlep it to Val Vista for the next closest location, I would just give up on this one altogether. Customer service is going downhill fast but I hope they get their act together soon.Way too expensive for a hot dog.  Confusing to eat there too unless you can speak Spanish.  Last time I checked I wasn't in Mexico.I think I've been spoiled with LA hot dogs.  The ones outside the clubs late night because when I ate Mickey's I was not impressed.  The tacos, however, were really good!  They have cabeza which a lot of places don't serve.  I would come back for my taco cravings!I was here for a conference and it had it's pros and cons. I was in a Jr King Suit and was disappointed that the bathroom was super small. The furniture was low quality. No microwave.  Wi-Fi cost per day which is just un-real these days and at this price point.

It is really located in a good place next to a mall and close to the interstate.  Room service was really impressive and the food quality was really good.  Very cool pool and common areas.  The front desk wasn't really nice or helpful. They seemed annoyed almost if you asked them something. I asked for a wake up call that never happened, thankfully I woke up on time.  Very comfortable bed. It's phoenix I know but still pretty bad view.

I probably wouldn't stay here again by choice. Hope this helps. Be sure and ask for a room with a big bathroom or shower if you do stay here.Nice comic books store, not very friendly but have a variety of back issues.We have been going to Nellos for years. Last night the hubby and I went for date night.  We started off with the Eggplant "brushetta" .  The toppings were heavy and the bread soggy. While tasty it was definitely NOT brushetta worthy.  Rename it to Eggplant Cheesy Bread and then you will get what you expect.  We also ordered the Spring salad with the house Balsamic. It was delicious!!  Nellos makes the best house dressing and this was equally as yummy as the original. We each order our own pizza. Hubby loved his pan crust Skinny. I being a creature of habit ordered what I ALWAYS get, the thin crust wheat spinach pie.  Here is why I only gave three stars... I think they must have a new chef. The pizza was soggy and I had to get a magnify glass out to find any feta... Oh no!! The main ingredient I was craving!  :( I voiced my complaint to our very attentive and friendly waiter Zach.  He had them make another. I requested it To Go  as by then hubby had finished his meal. Unfortunately the second pizza was the same as the first.  I will probably go back because the salads are just so wonderful but unfortunately my favorite pizza is no longer an option I will take a risk on again.  So disappointed after craving it all day!Adequate - it filled me up and was convenient to where I was at.

I was going to give it two stars for "Meh, I've experienced better" but the wings were pretty good, so I upped a star.  The wings had a good sauce on them, vinegary and spicy, and they were crispy.  They could have been a little bigger and meatier. 

The burger I ordered was a little overwhelming in flavors, and I actually had to stop eating it before it was gone.  The burger itself was rather small for a restaurant burger, slightly bigger than a patty from In-n-Out.  The fries were real potatoes that were nice and crispy, but not outstanding.

The atmosphere was pure chain, through and through.  The service was adequate but not exactly great.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if it was convenient I wouldn't say no.Waffle House has a certain cold, institutional weirdness about it. Combined with a folksiness that seems unforced but so strangely out of place, it just adds to the weirdness. It's like an episode of Hee-Haw directed by David Lynch.

Waffle House--and not just in terms of interior appearance-- is weird in a Mentos-commercial sort of way. It's an odd blend of shapes and textures that make you think it was somehow cooked up in lab by space aliens based on things they observed about our culture remotely, quickly prototyped in a large hanger, then deployed to our planet overnight in part of a program to observe and study our behavior.

The menus have the odd appearance of a parts catalog for a Pakistani-made bazooka. Odd, drop-shadowed fonts that just seem  . . . wrong in some way. The graphic designers for this place must just love their jobs. But then the food pictured is all Southern-style good-ol' boy trucker grub. Including grits. This is the weirdest one can make waffles, eggs and grits look without really trying at it.

The servers for the most part are friendly and efficient, though some of them speak in accents that probably haven't been commonly heard since around the time of the Civil War. I think there are still closed-off little mountain enclaves where people go from adolescence to military service to indentured labor at Waffle House. That's just the way of it.

The food seems ample, but it really doesn't satisfy. Shove a plate full of the oddly-textured waffles slathered in butter substitute into your mouth and you'll be hungry for lunch two hours later. It's not cheap, either.

So why does it exist? Setting aside for a moment the alien-conspiracy theory, I think Waffle House offers a minimal level of edible items around the clock. They are usually clean and located near highways. 

And that's about it.Had you asked me two past trips about this place, I would given it a "5" but this past two trips...bleh!  The service was slow, made several mistakes on my order and left off items off my friends plates.  One ordered two chicken tacos and got a chimichanga?!  I had the Mar Y Tierra Combo, which was very good.  I substituted the steak fajitas for chicken, and the waitress was very good about that and got that part right.  I don't like Refried beans, so I ordered the black beans...which I think may have been spoiled a bit : (  She did bring me the refried at first, I had to ask her to fix my plate, but again, one of the reasons I keep coming back is due to the great service when they are "on."  
Now, that's not to say, that I won't try it again...I'm an optimist.  The service, food and atmosphere was well done before...I keep hoping they get back to that!  
I will update the next time I go.  I say give them a chance if you're in the area.  If nothing else, get a drink : )I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.Of course, I always like to support local bookstores. But I needed some new shoes like no ones business and was directed to this strip mall. Next to a world fair/pier 1 import kind of store, a halloween store, a Ross Dress for Less, a shoe store and a Best Buy, not a bad strip mall. I figured might as well check it out, right?

I actually kind of liked this location. They had a Seattle's Best with a cafe in the front of the store as well as a medium-sized outdoor cafe where people were hanging out reading, talking with friends, smoking, etc. I mean...the view is of the parking lot. Yeah. But hey-nice touch!

The magazine and newspaper section was pretty impressive. They had a lot of art magazines, Bust, Bitch, Adbusters, Surface, Business 2.0, dwell, ReadyMade, a bunch really, and they carried NYT (a little east coast mission of mine).

They had a good recommendation section and some good deals (like 3 for 2) on some actually alternative paperbacks. The staff was super helpful and not all up in my grill. I had trouble locating the art book section...b/c it was weirdly placed in the music section? An all right selection-not huge, but had some interesting books I wasn't expecting them to have. It was little hard to find space to sit down though-what I thought was a cornerstone of Borders?

One thing I hate about a lot of bookstores is how much crap they sell besides books. Ugh. I mean, some journals, cards, pens, they are all within reason. They are "paper" related goods. But all that room to bad bargain books and useless merchandise always gives me the heebies jeebies. 

I wouldn't go out of your way to frequent this place, but if in the area maybe stop by, have a cup of coffee outside to gain some respite from consumerism, and enjoy the parking lot view.I've been hearing about Carvel's Ice Cream on Yelp for a year or more so I decided to track one down in AZ as long as I'm here.  We found this one on the way back from the Public Pool near Hamilton High and stopped in to see what the buzz was about.  I cannot speak for Schlotzky's food, though it smelled good, but the Carvel's Ice Cream was fantastic.  Wonderful texture, smooth and creamy soft-serve, choices of Vanilla, Chocolate or a swirl of the two (all three of us got that) in just a cheap flat-bottom cone, a very nice snack for only a buck-fifty each.  Worth the stop.

PS  I checked my receipt the next day and I was charged $1.99 each for the cones.  I will have to look into that.  It's not the money, just the principle of being charged more than what the menu board posted.  I'm knocking off a star for that but will reinstate it if there was a misunderstanding on my part.Dined with a networking group. The food at Old Chicago is ok .I have a soda and fettuccini alreado and it was pretty good, nothing mind-blowing. Pricing decent. The main thing this restaurant had was a private meeting roomthis place is tucked in a corner of what one might think is an abandoned strip mall at first glance. unless you are searching for this place you would probably drive by it every other time without a thought. Now the food however is worth the stop. i love Hawaiian food and this place makes damn tasty food. asides from the aesthetics of the location and the overall decor, my one major problem with the place was that they had no spam on their menu. no army base stew, no musubi, no spamwich, not even a basic hot Hawaiian breakfast. i mean come on! other than that, worth a stop just for the food experience and i would go back because its hard to find good authentic un-western influenced foods in arizona.I've been to this restaurant twice in three days.  My niece and I went on Sunday my suggestion after reading a review in new times. My niece decided she couldn't eat there as soon as we entered. I ordered a bean and cheese pupusa and a chili relleno. The chili relleno was stuffed with a ground or cubed meat. I didn't expect the meat so I pushed it over to my niece to nibbled on.  The pupusa was good, the beverage I ordered was super sweet.... So I went back today. Again I ordered the bean and cheese pupusa, it wasn't as good as Sundays. I also ordered a dish that was very similar to a tamale, it was wrapped in a leaf and was stuffed with cheese. IT was very good.  I also ordered the plantains with cream and beans.   The beans were very soup, traditionally so? I don't know and didn't care for them regardless.  I  have no real reference for Salvadorian food so ...  

I've had similar tamale type dishes wrapped in banana leaves, this version was very good but I must say not the best I've had. I will eventually go back to try the ceviche.   I'm not in a hurry.

I'm posting my review with a bit of reluctance.  My experience was not what I expected and doesn't fall in line with the reviews posted here or the review a read in new times.  Again my experience with Salvadorian food is limited.  So plesae consider my two cents with a bit of salt!  Peace!Strictly on eyebrow wax service-
First time I visited to have my eyebrows done they turned out great- nice and thin. The last few times I've visited they haven't turned out well at all, even though I request them thin as they grow fast. Guess it depends on who does them! Overall, clean store and staff is mostly friendly.I have been going here on and off for a few years now. I am not a fan of the breakfast buffet. just seems like the food is very bland. However, I do like the burgers. I have had  a problem with needing to get up and get my own refills. I like the atmosphere. There is one kid that waits on the people that I think he should stay in the back. He seems to be an idiot. I have had a very nice lady wait on me once and she was wonderful. My last time in I had a tall young man help us. He seems very nice and well mannered. If he was wating tables all the time, then maybe I would come in more often.I was back in the Gold Canyon area this past week....and couldn't find a Starbucks nearby...so I hoped in Geckos. Can't really say a whole lot.. I just had a cup of coffee for a $1.75. It was strong and hot, and satisfied my caffeine craving.Stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here. Prices are good and the atmosphere is good. I be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food.I stop at the restaurant where you can toss peanut shells on the floor.  
I had the roast beef dip which was very good with a little bit of bit to it. 

The Place- Is very small place - one room. Six or seven tables, a few booths, a pool table, a bar and a few TVs including a big screen - all in the same room. Unique atmosphere, decent service, and fresh peanuts (that you can throw on the floor). I will stop to try the pizza later at another visit.

This place could use a few more TV's and "special"

BTW --This is not CCW-friendly Eateries -No GUNS Sign are postedPackaged food and gas? Great! Hot food and restrooms? Not very good.We tried LGLG&C again because I just had to know if they could make the nachos better. As before the restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly.

This time we asked for 'cheese sauce' instead of blobs of shredded cheese (to which the waiter grimaced and said, 'that's much better'...he obviously didn't like their standard nachos either).

It seemed to be a bit of a big deal as he returned to the table to say, 'it will be a minute they have to get it melted.' But they came out quickly and were delicious! 

We have been popping in for nachos as we run around town and haven't had time for a full meal, once we do I'll update my star rating.It's inexpensive breakfast food at a little dive. Nothing impressive, really. Very popular with the locals and snowbirds alike, however.

Visit Date: 11/15/09Cracker Barrel - it is what it is, right? Go in expecting Cracker Barrel and that's exactly what you'll receive. I've always been tempted to get a job there.just so I can earn all those stars some of them have on their uniforms. Since being Starfleet officer is out of the question, this might be the next best thing.

I have noticed that a lot of what used to be cool in their "country store" has been replaced by Chinese-made junk. Today, there are tons of paper-thin Halloween costumes and Webkins, neither of which scream "country store" to me. Whatever.

Go when you're craving gravy, butter, and breading. If they had buttered  breading with gravy as a dish, I'd probably order it.Breakfast anytime ... and it's hard to mess up breakfast. It's a step up from franchise fast food (McDonald's, Burger King, etc.) on the road but not what I'd call a giant step. The big difference is that you get to sit down while they take your order (as opposed to standing in line at a counter). The coffee is OK but not what I'd call gourmet. Service is friendly and helpful.This place is quite popular in Casa Grande, especially since they added the sushi counter. It gives all the urban ex-pats something trendy to do without driving up to Scottsdale. 

Still, as Jeremy mentions, everything is pretty much mass-produced and any of their dishes can be obtained at any other generic Chinese restaurant. There must be a Chinese food service that provides this stuff. I've tried the sushi and it seems unremarkable to me, although I'm not sure I'd know good sushi if it hit me in the head.

The owners are nice and there's a bit more atmosphere than, say, Panda Express. But I'm not sure the food is any different.The pizza is great the other food ick. There are drink specials in a flip menu on the tables but when I ordered a mai tai (off that flip menu) I was told they don't have the stuff to make them (or many other items). So iodes a basic Margarita on the rocks and it tasted like dish dodo. The decor is shabby ... Time for an update (I think this is the same paint etc that was here when my family would visit when I was younger. The prices are high for the quality.I'm sorry to say this Outback has gone downhill in the last couple of months, or it was an off night for the chef. While the decor and service are always stellar, the food wasn't. We are used to perfection here - we've been going to this Outback every month or two for almost two years, and this was our first disappointing experience. 

Tonight, our coconut shrimp were overdone - I've never seen the coating so dark brown. My Outback Special steak was doused in pepper and so peppery-hot I could hardly eat it. This is the exact same Outback Special I order every time, and all four of us at the table had the same experience. My steak had a section of fat and gristle that I've never seen before in an Outback steak. 

Everyone else in our party ordered garlic mashed potatoes, and they all reported there was something "off" about them - they were so ordinary, nobody wanted to finish them or take them home. We were served one small loaf of bread, finished it quickly, and weren't offered anymore. It's sad, but we won't be visiting this location again.There pizzas are good, but I can get just as good or a little better for cheaper. The meatball sub is def temping the calzones look superb as well.Disappointing. The food is average although the portions are large. The wonton soup was good. The soda machine was broken. The "free" egg rolls were forgotten when we were served. They arrived after we had finished our meal. It was a cold day and there was no heat in the dining room which was freezing. Not much upside to this dining experience. I won't be back.The #24 General Tso's chicken, was really good. delivery service was a little slow but the food was pretty good.Love going here for nail supplies! They have everything for a good price but A LOT of their items don't have a price on them. It's vert irritating having to ask how much a majority of the items are.As fast food burger places go, this BK location isn't too bad. 

For a long time BK was a one trick pony, with their Charbroiled Whopper sandwiches. But now,  you see Chicken, Breakfast, 60% healthier fries, Big King, a Big Mac like double burger, and the not too healthy cinnamon buns have all been added. LOL. 

Still... they are no competition for the Oakbrook, IL folk, but BK is getting their corporate act together. Some might say finally. 

The employees all seem nice and helpful; while not looking too close at those just expired coupons. LOL I agree with fellow Yelp'ers Andrew and Javier in their assessment and call your attention to their Reviews. 

So Three and a Half Stars, and A-Ok in my book.it's a decent la fitness the selection is good and i go early enough where i don't have to deal with the crowd. you don't find the machines out of order too often and if they are they are fixed pretty quickly.Decent little taco stand sort of restaurant. The burrito that I had was good, nothing to shout about, but a solid breakfast burrito. The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good.

Mine came out pretty quick, but my friend's burrito was quite long in arriving. They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places. I would visit again to get a second opinion of the place.First, the hours on Yelp aren't correct. They are open until Midnight most nights and until 2AM (not PM) others.  We hurried over to be there by 2pm without real cause.

I had the carne asada tacos.  Pleasantly, they come with guacamole and pico already, so you don't need to order that extra.  The guacamole was even pretty good - not watery and thin like some places make it.  The tacos were pretty good -- not the best I've had, but not bad.

The Jamaica (hibiscus) iced tea was really, really sweet.  If you are looking for an unsweetened tea, don't get this.

The place was clean, and the staff is friendly.Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...I'll agree w/ the other reviewers, average, but I think its gotten  PRICEY for average.

I do love their pollo fundido.I only eat here because of the buy one get one free coupons plus it's close to my house in Chandler.  The food is okay and the drink prices are high.The pho here is pretty good for a pretty cheap price. Unfortunately, the eggrolls weren't the best. It tasted like Chinese eggrolls. I've had better.This is a great quick lunch spot! The Pho is aright not my favorite but great for the money only about $5 a bowl. They also offer many other dishes as well, their house crispy chicken, beef and basil chow fun, house fried rice, crispy egg noodles with chicken and vegetables, and their fried egg rolls are a must :-) I usually alternate between all of these dishes all of which are under $7-8 a plate.I gave this an A-OK rating because i'm not an expert of PHO. I like the food, but just haven't been to plenty of vietnamese places.

I ordered the spicy beef pho. It was good, very large bowl and the price was great ! This place was recommended to me by my asian friends. And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well, so it's probably a good place. Service was good, even though they were really busy.  I would go again, the menu has plenty of selections.Yummy pizza! Their portions are a bit small for the price, but it usually tastes pretty good. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu soon!It's a pretty mellow and middle of the road Italian resturant, it's not great but not bad either. Server was nice and the food (basic spagetti) was good. Atmosphere is definitely family friendly but a little loud for my tastes. Good middle of the road spot. I'd recommend it as a family outing that's not nearly as expensive as Olive Garden.As some one who has been coming here for years, I can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss. My family loves the baked spaghetti, pizzas, calzones, pizza muffins, and eggplant parm. I've had several of there other pasta dishes (eg: alfredo) and was not a fan. You just have to know what to order from there. The pizza and calzones are awesome!!!!!!Went to lunch with a coworker here this week. It was an overall very good experience. The food is a solid 3 stars (maybe even 3.5). The service, however, should get 4 or 5 stars. We were treated like royalty for no reason other than because they seem to treat all their customers that way. Gotta love that!

The food - I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't rush to say, "OH! Let's go to Pesto's, they have the best _______!" 

It was really good cheese pizza, though a bit too oily for my taste (and my heart continues to belong to Grimaldi's and Cibo in the pizza department). My coworker had a small dinner salad and a pepperoni calzone. He seemed to enjoy his meal as well. 

I did notice they do wine tastings, and I might like to come back for something like that after work sometime.Expensive. I don't mind paying money when I get something that is far and above better tasting then any other restaurant. In this case the price point is off a bit. Don't get me wrong aesthetically this restaurant looks nice, but the food wasn't better than any other pizza joint. I wasn't feeling the high tables either. I usually prefer places with booths. That is more comfortable to me. Pestos only has stall tables. Most of them are the high tables that I find uncomfortable. If you are willing to pay more solely for being is a good environment than so be it. I'm not though. I will pay for good food, but nothing here tasted that amazing. The food was good so that's a plus. This place will remain successful because there are people that only want to eat in environments like this restaurant provides, but just know that is what you are paying more for.I tried Pita Jungle for the first time and I am deeply disappointed that I was not greeted with: 

"Welcome to the jungle."

What a missed opportunity! Seriously!

I found the food to be pretty OK, not outstanding.  I had the chicken schwarma (aka Mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu) and it was no schwarma from Al Hana at Biaz Market, my friend.

The chicken was plentiful, and cubed. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful.  The sauce was some kind of garlicky-tahini-hummus tasting concoction that was fine.  The portion was just fair for the nearly 8 dollar price tag.

My server Valerie was a real treat so I would rate the service as 4 star even though that doesn't seem to jive with other reviews.Shmeh.  Pita Jungle (pronounced hoon-glay...kidding, not really) is an area standard in many respects, but when looked at objectively, it's kind of a mish mosh.  And a mediocre one at that.  Don't get me wrong - the food isn't bad.  It's just that if you are jonesing for anything Mediterranean, this is not your place.  The menu is loosely inspired by mid east cuisine, but really, it's more of an upscale, continental restaurant with hummus barely wafting through the air.  Chicken in any form is well-seasoned and moist, baba ghanoush is toothsome, as is hummus, though not better than Trader Joe's, sadly.  Taboule used poorly chopped curly parsley (really, that stuff should be reserved for garnishes and nothing else - flat parsley is the way to go) and was a little underdressed.  Hubby's salmon was fishy and tasted like it hadn't been seasoned.  Underwhelming all in all.

That all being said, with the lake view, well-appointed decor, modern art slicked walls, live music and potent drinks, this place is more of a spot for sipping and nibbling than tucking into generous plates of mideast fare.  Maybe they should call it the Pita Lounge (minus the pita).So, I had "Hummus with Grilled Chicken"  To be honest this is the only thing I have been a fan of. I tried a lot of the items on the menu and this is the only thing I go back for. Normally the Hummus with Grilled Chicken is better this time it was just ok the Chicken didn't taste great and the Hummus was not as flavorful, But not gonna hold that against them. I'll Still Come Back.So I am reviewing this place in hope that the business reads this and improves because they have delicious food and a lot of potential. The location is great it is very cool and inviting inside and overlooks a lake so thats always nice. They have a cool looking bar and interesting artwork. I tried 3 different plates so far and all were delicious they tasted fresh and were very flavorful. The only thing i recommend is not having their "teas". These are just water with some food coloring and absolutely no flavor!! (Very disappointing). The only reason this place is getting three stars is because the service was pretty bad. No one ever greets you here they just kind of look at you like they wish you were not there and then seat you like they are doing you a huge favor.  On my recent visit our server was very uninterested in serving. She seemed irritated when we were not ready to order and then retaliated by ignoring us for the next ten minutes or so. She kept walking by us and pretending not to see us so I finally called out to her and she just put her hand up and said "give me a couple minutes!" I do my very best not to piss off people who are handling my food so I just waited. She never apologized for taking so long and did not check up on us except to refill my nasty tea which she spilled and did not clean up :o 
I think I might go again because the food is so good but it would be really great if I were welcomed by a friendly staff and treated as a customer not as though I'm asking for favors. Please train your staff to be polite and friendly or just get rid of the bad seeds and this restaurant will do so much betterI love love love the food here! There hummus and chicken is amazing. I also love there boiled chicken salad or Mediterranean chicken salad. The only downfall to how great the food is, is the service. I've never really had outstanding service here. Yes, I do continue to go back because of the food and atmosphere but I wish the service was better :/Maybe a 3.5

I have relatively low expectations for chain steakhouses.  For whatever reasons, BAS seems to crank out some pretty good food consistently.

Back in the day (late 70s) the BAS at Alma School and Southern was THE place to eat in Mesa.  Decor has changed from the olden days but I say the food quality has actually improved.  In most cases the veggies (green beans and asparagus in my case) are always good to great.  Only critique here...they haven't yet properly figured how to trim asparagus.

As for appetizers we always get the fried zucchini.   Very good, not greasy and comes with a great cucumber dipping sauce.

Steaks are good.  To be honest, some night the quality is better than others, but overall its good.

I always order the wedge salad...big enough for two to share.  Since you get two choices of veggies (includes salads) with each meal, I highly recommend a party of two spit a wedge salad and the get three other vegetables.  They usually have good choices and they do do veggies good here.I personally give this place 5 stars being a visitor. Nice customer serivce didn't seem inpatient to me. I had time to pick then sat on ,my laptop with my siblings chatting and laughing the afternoon away. The ambiance is nice but the people were a bit stuffy. Main points go to free wifi with purchase but deduction for the nazi like approach to usage.

HOWEVER I lowered the score because my siblings said they are always treated poorly. They blame it on racism because the patrons and staff are predominately white. I like to think society is above that and am just blaming it on poor management. They experienced the same"hassling" as Mackenzie below mentioned. 

I would like to see their service upgraded. but there selections of coffee and decor were nice.You get three stars from me. Why? Because you're A-ok. But you're not fabulous. On the plus side you're cheap. And much like that characteristic in a date, I like that in my coffee shop. You, however, can be overly sweet.  And on the same comparison I like a little snarky. You miss that. The only place I've found with a really great coffee is in Austin, Tx. And as part of my commute to work its just 10 minutes too many out of the way. So Coffee Rush is my local haunt for now. But if Austin Texas gets just 10 minutes closer to Phoenix and my daily commute. . Well I'm definitely abandoning you.I have eaten at Yangtse a bunch of times and Nicole T. is right, it has super cheap lunch specials and big ole portions. And while the Orange Chicken is the best I have had in ages, every single other menu item i have tried is terrible. I love Egg Foo Yong, but it wasn't even edible at Yangtse. Also sub par is the Hot and Sour soup. My boyfriend said it smells like swamp water and although I argued for the sake of arguing, it kind of does. If the only thing you want to order is Orange chicken and Crab puffs by all means PLEASE go to Yangtse, cause theirs rule, but if you want anything else this is not your place.Excellent food and service (read the flow of beer was satisfyingly rapid) overall, the green salsa was wonderfully balanced providing a nice amount of heat with an excellent amount of taste. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed in my gorditas as the chicken was slightly dry but otherwise the rice and beans were definitely above par. Unlike some Mexican or New Mexican restaurants I was pretty pleased with the freshness of the ingredients, I didn't see brown lettuce or greenish tomatoes, and while the chicken was disappointing the rest of our dining party was greatly pleased. I will definitely go back to take a stab at the enchiladas or something else that impressed everyone else.For quality and taste of food this place is a solid 5, unfortunately the service lack a bit at my most recent visit and it resulted in luke-warm food and a long dining time frame.  The menu has a good variety and what's included in the dinner is a good value (Beans, Rice, Sopaipillas, Chips and Salsa)

The four Salsa/Dips served with the chips are "hot".  I personally enjoyed them all, but  my family had differing opinions.  The sopaipillas were a little dry but drenched in honey they were still a nice treat.

The chicken chimichanga was large and delicious.  Of course the portion size was a little out of control so I was able to take some home for another meal.

The service was the major malfunction of our visit.  As it was Friday, it was busy.  We were seated in about 20 minutes.  We received chips and drinks fairly quickly, however once we ordered our food, it took at least 30 minutes to get it.  Several families who were seated after us received their food before us.  When we finally received our food it wasn't at an ideal temperature.  It was still warm enough to eat, but it did seem like it sat under a warmer for a while.  

Overall, I would recommend Si Senor as the Mexican food served is quite appetizing and well worth it.I use to go there every weekend for dimsum.
I didn't mind waiting 30 min to get in, the food was good.

BUT...one day I saw food from the cart dropped on the floor, and the manager came quick and put that food back in the plate and served....
I could not believe my eyes.

That was the last day for me and C-Fu restaurant.I used to work here so I may be just a little bias. However, I come here whenever my whole family, especially, my grandma wants to eat dim sum. Anyway, the food is okay because we ordered 5 plates of plain rice noodles for my vegan sister but 2 of the 3 plates were not even cooked all the way so she didn't even eat much. I felt really bad for her because her choices were very limited (especially when it comes to dim sum). Anyway, lots of the food here are pretty good/okay. However, they are just too pricey for me. Plus, if you are looking out for your figure, um...I suggest you just drink water here.This place used to be very good. They are missing a lot of products and their meat and veggies aren't as fresh as before. Sometimes you would get this food one week and the next they don't have it anymore. I hate there is no consistency to their products. It's either a hit or miss sometimes.I have been to Ninja three times and it has been consistently good, but not great.  They have some great lunch deals with my favorite so far being the yakuniku, which was very good.  One of the people I was with had the chirashi bowl and he said it was good.  I have not been blown away, but the food is consistently good and very reasonably priced for lunch.My first time to this place yesterday for early dinner. It is what it is. Unpretentious sushi. Unlike other reviews the ratio of rice to other ingredients were as they should be. Also unlike other reviews, the rolls were tightly made so nothing falling apart. Maybe it's all in who makes them. Ours were made by one of the owners. The ones we ordered were the Volcano, Rainbow, Ninja 1, Las Vegas, and Shrimp Tempura Roll. I would order all again except for the Volcano as it is a hot/cooked roll and did not particularly like the texture and temperature. I would definitely go here again.Not bad food but both times I have eaten there we were forced out by the loud techno musicWe've eaten several times at Ninja, a couple using a Groupon. I prefer not to use Groupon though as they have a large selection of "all you can eat" sushi for $20 (which you can't use the groupon towards). It's not the worlds best sushi but it is good and a great deal for the price. We have not tried the teppan side but it's always packed. The service has been slightly slow but decent. I'd say it's somewhat kid friendly because, while there are no coloring books they do have kid entrees. We will definitely be back.Can you say "carrot raisin muffin?"  Can you convince your breakfast mates to order the same and give them to you?  My poor husband knows the "drill" all too well!  They taste like good old fashioned carrot cake - just the right amount of nuts.  I really like Mimi's for breakfast (truly something for everyone,) and on breakfast, I give them four stars.  The reason for three, is lunch and dinner...nothing at all special.This was my second time eating breakfast here.  It didn't seem as good as last time, the crust on the quiche was a little over done.  That said, the brioche cinnamon roll was great, best I've had in a while.  Also, the potatoes are much better with onions and mushrooms added.  The pricing seems a little high compared to most breakfast places around here.  Still, a solid choice overall.I kinda don't get the ratings on this one.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly, but the food is very mediocre.  The quality of the fish is so-so and the portions aren't really all that great.  On top of that the prices are outrageous.  
I've been here twice now,just to give it a chance, and I probably wouldn't go back.  Really- you can get better sushi at a MUCH better price at plenty of places near here.If you want good sushi and don't care about awkwardly bad service and an overly egocentric sushi chef, this is your place.

This is a TINY place in a strip mall in Chandler.  I didn't even SEE it until I turned back around, and I can't even give you a good marker by which to find it, except to tell you it's NOT where any major drugstores/gas stations are.

The place is adorable.  It probably seats 40 people max if they smush.  Cozy booths and what looks like a great posh large 10 person area in the back is perfect for meeting friends for sushi or throwing a small birthday party.

Our waiter was the most adorable nice man...with a horrible memory.  We ordered 2 seaweed salads: forget them both, then brought one, then we reminded him we got 2--this took 20 minutes just for the first reminder.  We ordered 6 pieces of sushi, 4 showed up...I mean, if i didn't feel like a super friendly great-uncle was serving me and the environment wasn't so great, I think I would have been irritated.  The whole place just calms you down with the environment, plus I was catching up with an old friend.

Our sushi chef left the sushi bar and was talking to one of the other tables for the LONGEST time...we had to roll our eyes because he was bragging about himself so much.  I mean, dude, your food was good, but that doesn't mean you can stop making it while people are still hungry!!!

I felt so bad, and they felt worse--they comped our salads.  Seriously though, the rolls were PHENOM and the sushi was top notch.  Just go when you're meeting a long-lost something or someone you really haven't seen in a while...otherwise, you may not enjoy the experience as much as I did.The food at Cyclo is entirely over-shadowed by its outrageous owner, Justina Duong.  If Justina was a gay man, she would make a great drag queen.  I think she's a hoot, but her outlandish behavior and brash comments do not work for everyone.  

I have a very dear friend who lives in Chandler and she and I would go into Cyclo quite often.  My friend is married with three kids, but just she and I would go in.  She would always tell Justina about her family and show her pictures of the kids.  Justina really gets into teasing the customers and after a couple of years, she told my friend, "You crazy fag-hag.  You never bring your family in here.  You just come in with your gay friend.  You don't even have a family.  Crazy Lady, you just carry around those pictures to make your lonely self feel better."  Justina also plays up the Vietnamese accent.  She can be off-putting at first if you don't know what's up, but the floor show never disappoints if you're willing to play along.

The food is good enough now, but it was better when the restaurant first opened.  The star dishes include Tom Rang Hat Tieu, an appetizer of shrimp on toasted baguette slices with a savory black pepper sauce that is plate lickin' good.  Another delicious starter is Banh Xeo.  It's a crispy rice crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the crepe slices before you eat them.  For entrees, Ca Ri Ga is a tasty chicken and pineapple curry and Com Tam is a mixed grill of a marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp, and egg over broken rice.  As a side dish, the Dau Xanh Xao Toi is a sublime preparation of spicy garlic green beans with chili and sweet soy.  

However, the quality now varies.  The last time I went the pineapple curry was totally bland.  Even though I have eaten at this place many times, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be bothered with Justina's reaction.  Instead, I haven't been back.  

I have been into Cyclo when Justina was not there and the quality of the food was nowhere near the same in her absence.  My concern is that Justina has announced plans (yet again) to open a second Cyclo in the Valley.  This time it's supposed to be on Central Avenue south of Camelback and across from Brophy with a fall 2008 opening.  Once that place opens, I assume Justina will move her floor show to central Phoenix and I am left to wonder if the quality of the food will continue to slip in Chandler.

Cyclo has a BYOB policy and some people are really into it.  For me, it's not a huge selling point.  I prefer not to schlep my own booze to a restaurant, but it's cool if you're into it.

If you go to Cyclo, hope that Justina is there.  You're really going to Cyclo for Justina's antics rather than the food.Having had a previous five star experience a few years ago made me wonder what went wrong the weekend I visited the spa again.  

Cafe was great, service was great, food and drink A+.

The tranquility of my massage was constantly interrupted by someone coughing (turned out to be the therapist next door), my next appointment was given by the coughing therapist, my facial however was the best. I had requested females for my services, this was confirmed at check in. Not sure why I ended up with the male (coughing) therapist.

Pool area, locker room area, shower area...basically all needed to be cleaned up. Towels on the floor, amenities not kept up, had to requests the basics. 

First visit definitely excellent, this visit poor to average at best.I go here for some things on occasion... they make good deserts/sweets and I can get a few things that are not in many other places.

Other than that, they are expensive.... similar to Whole PayCheck Foods so for the majority of the items I need I buy they for 30% less at the regular grocery store.I went here for dinner and only got the buffet because I couldn't decide what to order off the menu. I really enjoyed the chicken tikka masala. I like mildly spicy food and this was perfect. The rest of the food was kind of bland. The dinner buffet was $10.99; I think that is reasonably priced but it was the first Indian buffet I've ever had so I can't compare. The service was outstanding.I have a Love/Hate Relationship with Jason's.

I LOVE that:
~They have a Huge Menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta etc.
~They have baked potatoes bigger than my head
~Their simple but perfect salad bar
~The ginger bread muffins at the salad bar * 1 reason alone to go*
~The assortment of wrapped crackers at the salad bar
~Everything  looks so good and is so big
~They always have some new "special" when I go in
~If you have room after lunch you can help your self to a soft serve ice cream cone

I HATE that:
~They are always packed liked sardines
~They aren't very clean
~They serve a pile of greasy broken ruffles with the sandwiches
~The Tuna isn't good
~There is barely room to walk between the tables
~The sandwiches aren't ever as good as I want them to be, but are OK nonetheless (see pics)

***3.5 starsFor a simple egg breakfast, it was pretty decent! I would go there and order it again!I like this location because they have a drive-thru. Even though there is almost always a long line, they get you on your way fast. The staff is friendly and competent. Also, they rarely run out of anything (other locations seem to go through their entire inventory of breakfast sandwiches and scones by 9am).

If you are the type that does not drink your morning coffee inside a moving vehicle, they also have comfy chairs inside and decent patio seating.  The patio faces the parking lot and drive-thru but it does have shade umbrellas so it can be very pleasant in the morning.Lowes is fine but DO NOT use their contractors. Especially their door installers. Don't show up, don't return phone calls. Horrible service. Lowes should find better contractors as they are a poor representation of a good company.Received a coupon in the mail for a free entree and decided to try it out.  I got the buffalo chicken quesadilla and the boy got the blue moon burger.  He said the burger was pretty good.  My quesadilla had good flavor, however I could feel my arteries clogging with every bite.  There was SO MUCH cheese and I didn't realize the chicken would be breaded and fried.  Probably obvious to most, however I didn't connect the dots.  I ate half and took the rest for the boy to eat for lunch the next day.

Everything was clean, service was friendly, food was good.  

I love that you can pick two songs for 25¢, I only wish we had the chance to hear the songs we picked.  Next time, I'd love to hear a little Incense and Peppermints.Nothing really special here.  Service is nice but takes a while to get your food and I wasn't really blown away.  Salsa isn't really even good either.  Will likely try again but I don't have high hopes.For someone like myself who hasn't plugged in her TV for six months, Jilly's is a great place to go for a little television fix. Although one time there wasn't sound, the televisions are great for dinner discussions or for instant distractions when you don't feel like talking

I think the food is fantastic as well, especially the wings. And rounding everything off, the wait staff is very relaxed and friendly.Ok, so, I finally ate at Wanda's.  It is located right near the Chandler Harley Davidson, and its alright.  The seating is really intimate, and rather small.  The largest table in this place is for seating of 4. I didnt care for how small it was, in regards to limited seating.  They do have outdoor seating, but again, they lost points with me for only having tables for either 2 or 4.  What I DO like about it, is that the service was quick, and its not the usual chain resturants like IHOP or Waffle house.  Limited menu, only open a few hours a day (like 7-3) and primarily have a breakfast and lunch menu.Cool little find. Average food but awesome servers and friendly environment draw you in. I noticed nobody even needed a menu lol. They were all greeted by name and asked if they wanted their "usual". Family feel for sure :)Red Lobster reminds me of Olive Garden with a seafood focus. Our server reminded me of Brian, the sever with "flair" from Office Space. He seemed nice, just a tad over the top.  I appreciate the effort, but he had a little to much energy for me.  

The food was better than I expected and they were perfect size portions for lunch. My salad was a little over dressed and the add on shrimp were the tiny little ones (now I see why it was only 99 cents), I wouldn't get them again. The biscuits and jambalaya were good.

We went there to use a gift card we won. I would go back if we won another one, but with so many places to eat, Red Lobster is not going to be my first pick.Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  

They ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them "ooh"ed and "ahh"ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.

I would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)

*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories
*Mojito = 190 caloriesIt's Red Lobster. What do you expect. If you think it is going to be the best seafood you have ever had then you haven't had really good seafood. But at the same time it isn't the worst. It isn't some dark dirty place with questionable seafood that will make you sick just looking at it. It is what it is.
You go to Red Lobster when they have a special. Which most of the time are pretty good and not to expensive for what you get. The regular menu, to me, is not to exciting. Same old same old. The most recent time I was here I got their pick two special for like $12 or $13 dollars. I got the shrimp and crab pot pie, which sounds interesting I know but it was actually pretty good, and the Parmesan fried shrimp. You think you need cocktail sauce for the shrimp but they taste great just by themselves. Overall it was surprisingly good. Plus who can resist their cheddar biscuits. So good. The pot pie was topped with the cheddar biscuit dough so it made it that much better.
Like I said when they have a special that looks good I will be back. The restaurant is clean and nice and the service is always good. It is what it is.Went here because my friends wanted to. I asked our server how much a specific drink was since they don't put prices on the menu and he said "Oh, $5, maybe some change", I thought it was reasonable enough and got one and it ended up being $6.99. It may sound stupid but this really bothered me because I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it was actually $7 for a shot of rum with some fruit juice. I'm a server in a similar price range restaurant and know what it's like so I don't expect a server to have every price of everything memorized but just check and come back if you don't know. If that wasn't the case then he just flat out lied which I also don't appreciate.
Entree tasted okay but was overpriced. The salad looked pretty pathetic and like it was from an elementary school cafeteria...small amount of cheap bagged salad with one big dressing blob in the middle. Darden should probably spend less on interior decorating and more on fresh food.I arrived at lunch time it was really busy... I stood there to be seated for while and I finally ask someone what they wanted me to do seat myself or did they seat me. The staff was really friendly but really slow took forever. I ordered Spicy Noodles spice level 4 it was pretty hot good flavor it came with a spring roll really good but the salad it came with was just ok. I will give this place another try really good lunch prices.I had read positive reviews about Swaddee Thai being one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoenix and was excited to finally have an opportunity for a visit.  I recently moved slightly closer to Swaddee, and a visit seemed inevitable, in part, due to the location in a strip mall next to Zoyo.  Overall, it was okay.  We entered a little after five and were the only patrons.   A few guests joined us and there seemed to be a few to go orders.  Our waitress was Thai and accommodating to my family's dietary proclivities.  The food was entirely unremarkable. My green curry, the dish I eat always order and use to judge all Thai restaurants, was watery and bland.  My wife was in full agreement with my tepid evaluation.  My daughter didn't seem particularly excited either.Red curry was watery and rather average.  Hot and spicy noodles were tasty, although I wish there were more noodles than the rest of the items in there.  Seemed to be filler items like iceberg lettuce in this dish, which were rather random.  I

f you want delicious Thai food, go to Siam Thai in Glendale!  Still my favorite in the Valley.  No other Thai place I've tried out has measured up.A little pricey for a timepiece re-size, but convenient location.This is a hard one because their food is so good and in such large portions but everytime I've been there the service is really slow and crappy.

Was there for dinner on Monday and whilst there wasn't many people in there we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to order the appetizer... with our food btw.

But their bread rocks at the beginning of the meal and the chicken marsalla is so awesome as is the goulash and mostly everything else.  The cheesecake is the best i've ever had even though I don't get it everytime... not a huge sweets guy but it is really good.

I'd still say go but be patient...It's not best buy, but it's certainly not worst buy either.  It's a corporate chain, what do you expect?  Personally, I'm not a fan of the stores where employees are scrambling all over each other to get at you - either to upsell, push a credit card on you, or to guarantee a commission - so when these employees ignore me, I'm much happier.  I will not step foot in a Best Buy without knowing what it is I'm going in for and I always make sure they have it in stock before I enter the realm of mall-like craziness.  When I need help with an item or am looking for a recommendation, their staff has been fairly useful for the most part, and I've been able to navigate the lazy river of numbered high school employees without much issue.  

I do think they need a few more registers, however, because the check-out line gets ridiculous, especially during the holidays (oh god, why would you even bother?) or when they only have two people ringing everyone up.I wasn't expecting this restaurant to be so expensive. 


Went here yesterday with the boyfriend and his grandparents for his grandmothers birthday. The waitress was attentive and kind and there wasn't a wait for a table so there aren't any complaints there. 

The menu didn't really impress so I just ordered sushi and miso. His grandparents meals looked good and his grandma let me try the sauce her chicken came in and tasted great. They also ordered calamari for the table. It was very authentic calamari but the portion was pretty measly for an appetizer meant for a table. The spicy mayo sauce was to die for. The sushi was okay but not worth the price at all. If my boyfriend has to pay 22 bucks for two nigiri and one roll, I really want the sushi to wow me and don't want to just give him the rest of the rolls because I'm not satisfied. The miso soup was wonderful though.

I think I wouldn't mind trying here again if I came during lunch or happy hour. The prices were just outrageous to me. I really don't mind spending a lot for a quality meal but this place simply didn't sell me.Kona Grill is one of my go to for Happy Hour with my husband and friends. My favorite is the Avocado Egg Rolls but I often get Veggie Rolls with tempura flakes and eel sauce. YUM!   But even if you just go to have a drink at the bar it has a great atmosphere for just hanging out.Its what you expect, burgers and fries.

But wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum.

I find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side.

Here's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal.

Comfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert.A Sunday brunch connoisseur cannot ever get blown away by this place. 

I will not complain about the ambience, it is indeed pretty. But I'm definitely not going to vouch for the food here. I don't know if this has something to do with the Chandler location but nothing on the menu is upto the mark.

When you look at the menu it sounds grander than it actually is. Believe me when I say that the pancake or french toast looks far more appetizing at IHOP. I'd suggest that you spend 10 mins preparing the Potato and Leek packet soup (by Knorr) at home rather than taste any of their creamy soups.

During the shopping season they put novices behind the cash counters and take inordinately long to serve a plate that totally falls short of your expectations.

A strategic location or good interiors does not make for a good restaurant!I have always liked this place and find the overall ambience and food to be very enjoyable, although it's generally very crowded around the lunch hour.  I stopped here for lunch today at 12:00pm on the dot.  It was packed, very loud with about five to seven people in line.  Fortunately the line moved fairly quickly since I was starving.  

I'm on a low carb diet, which limits my food options in general.....why I'm having lunch at a place known for their homade bread doesn't make much sense!  I must like torture!!!  Well, I stick to the diet and order the grilled chicken ceasar salad to go.  I've eaten this salad at leat five or six times and always enjoy the tangy dressing, freshly grated parmesean cheese and nice portion of grilled chicken, along with the addition of sauteed mushrooms.  It also includes homemade croutons and two HUGE slices of freshly baked sourdough!  I was, again, able to avoid temptation!!!  This time the salad was just not that good...it had too much dressing, not enough lettuce and a smaller portion of chicken.  I should have gone with the hummus plate which is still fairly low carb as it's served with grilled vegetables.

I have stopped here for breakfast from time to time and have really enjoyed the frittatas and breakfast sandwiches (pre low carb era).  It's nice to be able to sit in a comfy chair and read the newspaper while enjoying the food.  Overall, I think Wildflower is pretty good at what they do.  They sure know how to pack in the crowds :)The hair that was baked into my muffin was not as delicious as some may believe. Watch for hairs before you bite into your muffin. ;) Luckily the service, especially the guy at the register(Oliver), were really nice and made the experience better.Ok I can eat here and be full but nothing to write home about......YSL Counter at Nordstroms.

I have shopped at Nordstroms my entire life, and I've never had this much hassle before. I had three products from YSL that my mom bought for me that just didn't suit, so I brought them back for an exchange. The poor saleslady had to keep going back and forth between me and her manager because, even though the products were bought at Nordstrom, I didn't have the receipt. It was so much hassle the saleslady and myself, just for an exchange. 

In the end, they exchanged it. The saleslady herself was super friendly and introduced me to new products and helped me try on a bajillion different red lipsticks. She even gave me samples of products she thought suited my skin. 

But seriously, Chandler Nordstrom, all that back and forth for an exchange?Food is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you pay. Way too pricey!I have to go here every now and again. Why, you ask? Isn't this a free country? Surely a modern man, one who lives in the wild west no less, can decide where he wants to sup. I have a 14-year-old daughter, that's why. I have to give in on the little things so I don't have to give in on the big things, like faux-stache-wearing guys named Larry pulling into my driveway in Camaros.

Olive Garden is Olive Garden. I've no primary evidence of this, but I understand they have no actual chefs on the premesis and everything is just portioned, frozen boil bags. I don't really need to review the food because it's underwhelming, overpriced, and featuring enough butter to kill an elephant, and everyone knows it. Ever wonder why your body groans in protest for six hours after eating here? Yah.

I give the food 2 stars but the service 4. The only real difference among Olive Gardens is the service. Our dude was cool, and he didn't even try pushing the wine on us. Now that I think of it, he didn't do any upselling at all and that's fine by me. What was cool is that my 8-year-old daughter was clearly freeloading, eating several big plates of the table salad and a couple breadsticks. She wasn't hungry enough to order anything, and of course she ended up munching. The waiter didn't say anything and didn't charge us any plating fees or what have you.

So, they lost a few bucks that a kid's menu item would have cost, and gained a customer that will come back again when he has to give in to his teenager. Larry will not be accompanying us.I have to tell you, this is a 2.5 star review masquerading as a 3-star review.  And I only went with three because our server happened to write something cute on the little card that they pass out with every check now.

The food was really "meh" at this location.  I realize Olive Garden is not gourmet Italian food by any stretch, but the location I usually frequent has more more "flavor."  

We also went and noon and were "frowned upon" by the wine server for not tasting (sorry, fresh out of church - not on a date!) and were not even OFFERED the lunch menu until we asked (which is a savings of $3/plate.)

As I said, our waitress was about 4 stars, the rest of the place about 2.  I think a solid 2.5 is good.Sometimes you want a meal you don't have to think about. Nothing about Olive Garden is particularly exceptional. Food is good, drinks and alright, desserts are solid. It's just a good, casual place to carb up and hang out and grab a glass of wine. It's easy, fun and a no-brainer ... perfect when you want decent food and don't mind the noise from surrounding families.

Give these a try: Glass of Moscato, Gnocchi & Toscana Soup, and get the alfredo boat to give life to those breadsticks.Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. There were 12 of us and our waiter took great care of us in spite of the group size. We asked for separate checks and he didn't show any signs of an attitude at all. At the end, when our checks came some of us realized he had forgotten to charge us for our sodas. When we pointed it out to him, he brushed it off and said, "If it's not on the bill, it won't be there at all. Don't worry about it!" Now if only all our waiters can forget about charging us for alcoholic beverages...

As for the food, my favorite was the free corn bread. Fresh from the oven, piping hot, sweet, with whole kernels of corn baked in and served in a mini baking pan. I could have eaten an entire pan of it and called it a night. In hindsight, that's what I should have done. The birthday girl suggested I try the Grilled Miso Salmon since she knows I LOVE seafood, adding that it was "pretty decent salmon considering we're in the middle of the desert." I'll also admit I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Well, let's just say I'm sure there can be better salmon found in the middle of the desert than at Z'Tejas. The salmon was overcooked even though I asked for medium rare. The mashed potato cake on the side was just a lump of dry mashed potato that tasted like it was leftover and sitting in the fridge since last Thanksgiving. I definitely should have gone with a salad or Mexican dish.Zteja's consistently delivers good food. I frequent the Chandler location for lunch because it's near my office. "Satisfied" is the feeling I walk away with every time.... Not ecstatic, not disappointed.   I particularly like that they've updated their menu to include vegetarian and gluten-free sections.  They've always offered these selections, but you had to pick through it and remove meat... but get charged for it!  The new menu allows you to get regular items without meat at a reduced price... me likely ;-).  

My favorites are the Ancho Chopped Salad (Minus the meat and bacon) and the mushroom enchiladas.   Their chips and salsa are okay, but not really worth paying the $4 for.  I would recommend holding off for the corn bread... hint, hint... they don't bring it out until you order, it kills their ability to up-sale! 

I definitely recommend Zteja's for lunch, its good food with quick service (45min out the door).  My actual rating is 3.5, but that's not an option.After visiting my third or fourth "Mexican" restaurant in Chandler, I have come to the conclusion that I have to drive to an actual neighborhood where people of Mexican descent actually live to get good Mexican.  

I think I've had better Mexican in Maine than Arizona so far, it is distressing.  If any of you native Phoenicians (is that how you say it?) out there are reading this review, please drop me a line and PLEASE tell me how to get REAL Mexican food!

Anyhows, this place was very pleasant, I stopped in here late for a drink at the bar, checked their menu and saw the usual American interpretations of Mexican food.  So I can't really rate the food here, but it sure as heck doesn't look like good Mexican to me.

The margarita was their best (shouldn't you get a great one in the Phoenix area?  I think you should) on their drinks menu, made with Cuervo 1800 tequila.  I realized after a few sips that I prefer Sauza Hornitos, but it was passable.

Two inebriated ladies sitting next to us at the bar made the experience more enjoyable!Great staff.  The first time I visited a Z'Tejas, it was at the location in Phoenix for brunch.  I didn't even know there was a location in Chandler.  At night this location has a "grown and sexy" like vibe with the dim lighting.  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Love that they have a whole veggie section on the menu, it made choosing my meal so simple.  I had the wild mushroom enchiladas, my friends had the salmon.  The Food was good but the portions are a bit small.  My friends enjoyed their cocktails and the Ancho Fudge Pie was Yum!  Staff is really kind and accommodating.  Love the cornbread!Good place to come after work.  The appetizers on the happy hour menu are the way to go.  I was very disappointed in my seafood burrito - hardly any toppings at all!Affordable eatery and the food tastes pretty good too. Changs Spicy Chicken is pretty good though the Hot and Sour soup could go easy on the sodium. Dimly lit interior fits in with the whole vibe and style of cuisine. Pretty friendly waiting staff and the service is above average. Lots of drinks to choose from. PF Changs is a nice establishment to venture to every few months.I don't bowl, but I make a fierce cheerleader. So when CJ invited me to a Democratic fundraiser for another district, I jumped on it. Even though, as CJ pointed out, I'm not a registered Democrat. Whatever. The lanes seemed nice, but more importantly they have good, cold beer. Their food leaves a bit to be desired, especially when the beer goes down so smoothly.

On a side note, we had some fantastic gay drama towards the end of the night. It almost wrecked my buzz.My co-workers and I have tried going here for happy hour drinks/food twice. The restaurant is great. Don't get me wrong but, I don't think they know how to deal with a large party. I've even called ahead and all they say is well we can't accommodate you until you've arrived and then they run around like a chicken with their head cut off for 10 minutes pushing together 2 tables. Pretty good prices overall though.Great food but service was a little slow, seemed under staffed. Overall very reasonable for the quality and quantityI've eaten here before and had the steak which is really good. This visit, I had the prime rib since I was trying for something different and the server said it was what they were known for. The prime rib was really good and so was the grilled veggies and baked potato it came with. The food here is pretty good and consistent but I gave it 3 stars because, well, it's a steakhouse and there isn't anything here you can't get at other similar steakhouses. Would I dine here again? Yes, but I like to try new things so it wouldn't necessarily be a first choice.I think Espos has been there since the dawn of time.  I've eaten there off and on since the early 80s.

I went back today for the first time in probably 10 years.  The food is good and certainly plentiful for the price.

Today I ordered a carne asada burrito and and chimichanga.  Overall they were good but were in serious need of salt.

As always I found the salsa to be a little spicier than I prefer.

The guacamole was quite good.BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless, tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me, not so much. However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well.

I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot.

For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.

I recommend BJ's for a casual night out.Consistently good Happy Hour. Good burgers and drinks. The downside is how crowded it gets and that the happy hour is only good in the bar. It should be entire restaurant.In years past I would have easily given Flemings 5 stars.  The restarurant is too noisy.  We always dine in the bar, but there is very limited seating.  My husband loves the bone-in rib-eye and it was prepared perfectly for him.  Our salad was delicious and of course no complaints about the beer and wine.  Fleming s Potatoes, (layed potatoes, cream, and cheese)-usually slightly spicy, were old and flavourless. My food was gross; braised short-ribs and spinach. Too much fat on the meat.  My dessert (for my birthday!) was cream brulee and was always one of the best around, but in this case, the texture was mushy.  I have had jello pudding that was smoother and tastier.  
The worst part was that we both got sick serveral hours later.  The only thing that we both shared was the Fleming s potatotes and the salad - the Perfect Wedge  with blue cheese dressing.  It tasted really good though.  So maybe it was the potatoes.  Bottom line is that it was a shame for a Saturday night, $150.00 dinner.Please note that this place should get 3 1/2 stars.

The food is very good here.  I find it way better than typical bar fare.  Their menu is better than good fo sho.  Good place to watch a game and throw peanuts around.  It is priced very well too. 

 I would actually like this place alot more, but I always get a waitor instead of a waitress! I love waitresses and I love talking to them and having fun with them.  It completes my dining experience. (GO Ahead and make fun all you want)  Waitors are just not my thing.  If you are going to have a guy in a place like this put him behind the bar and let him make a stiff drink.  Leave the waitressing to the ladies.My wife and I rolled in here late yesterday afternoon to meet some of her friends. I dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling. My eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - Score! Nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people. 

Started off with a nice refreshing pint of Guinness which hit the spot and was on special. My wife and I ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.And by the way, when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings. I live for a while near Buffalo in Rotten-chester...eerrrr...Rochester New York and wings are definitely supposed to be served with Blue Cheese as the dipping sauce...I digress.

Anywho, after I ordered I said to myself "Dam, I forgot to tell her blue cheese" and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve. When the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce, which I find disconcerting, and low and behold there are 2 LARGE ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch. Steven Tyler Pj's, Steven Tyler PJ's...nice call Teakwoods. The wings were really good too...I nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings (and I should have). Only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate.

For dinner, I ordered the Caesar Salad with "Grilled & Chilled" shrimp. Sounded good...tasted awful...and for $13 bucks far from a good value. The salad itself wasn't bad but a Caesar should be mostly the hearts of Romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap.  I also overlooked the Caesar faux pas of the red onion rings...but the shrimp was unforgivable. My guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of "Grilled & Chilled" shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in. That pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today...zoiks! Fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a HUGE difference AND justified me throwin' down 16 bucks for it, which is how much you figure it costs with the tip. Maybe the owner should watch an episode of Chef Ramsey's "Kitchen Nightmares," in fact any episode, and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin' lazy cook it all ahead of time method. 

My wife has been on Phase 1 of South Beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin' a nice cheeseburger and fires. She was psyched to see sliders on the menu; however, they too were a HUGE disappointment, in fact she didn't even finish them. The bread was not moist and obviously stale, and the meat was dry and tasteless. They screwed up the fries...how do you screw up fries?  She said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless...dude...some type of seasoning...any seasoning. 

Teakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient, I liked the vibe, and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet. 

Two parting words of advice for this restaurant "Fresh Ingredients."I have moved to Seattle, and pre-order tamales when I'm back in Phoenix over the holidays! The dine in food is also good!The food was good, but really not what I had been looking for.  I wanted a nice sit down place with a frozen marg. and that is not what this place is.  This place has good food, served in disposable aluminum take out containers.  Again, the food was good, but greasy.  My party sat themselves and you go up to the counter to order and pick up your food.  The woman at the counter was helpful.  As a pescatarian, I can't say there were many options that satisfied my criteria.  This was a good place, in my opinion to get take out mexican, but a bit too much like burger king or McDonalds for a dine in place.   Plastic silverware, served to you on a cafeteria tray, etc. Also, no booze.  Sad Panda.  That said, there was a massive rush of people coming in around 630pm on Sunday.  Maybe the meat versions of their dishes are really good, but I wouldn't know.  It got a bit loud from the noise of the dinner crowd.While this place is better than most generic, greasy Mexican places that are popular in Phoenix (go figure), the only really great thing here is their carne asada tacos. The horchata is too sweet and kind of bland. Service is okay- they forgot my order but promptly made it when I brought it up to them. The salsa is BAD. It tastes like the pizza sauce that comes in Lunchables.Food is decent .... nothing to rave about, portions are good and fairly priced.This place was really pretty good. Food served take-out style in styro containers, but it is quite tasty, and huge portions. Working in Gilbert, it seems really hard to find good Chinese food for lunch, and this fits the bill perfectly. While it may not be perfect in terms of culinary execution, it is definitely tasty and I will be back for sure.I went to this Serrano's location after a hard days work on home improvements with my dad. I got the taco salad, which was disappointing. I think you get more food in the taco salad from Taco Bell and it's half the price and even tastes a little better. Our waitress was great though, she was really nice and attentive. 

To sum it up, the food was disappointing, but feed me and the service was great. That's all she wrote.Have eaten here twice. Both times I was a little...how do I say it...underwhelmed.  Fish just not quite as fresh as it I've found it at other places. Rolls not quite as tight, or interesting as other places I go to regularly....like Sakana.  

In this part of town there aren't many places to get sushi, so it's convenient but not where I'd bring a date.  More of a...I need a quick sushi fix kind of place.Ok...so we all know (or at least I do...) that the Floridino's on Alma School is really really good. Not only is it good, but it's cheap! 


The BF and I decided to try the new location and to our surprise it is not really the same restaurant. I think it has different owners (?), the menu is different, the prices are higher, the food is not as good, and the service is lacking to say the least. I was SO disappointed. The restaurant itself is a lot colder feeling than the original, with weird lighting and is strangely quiet (the place wasn't empty, but it didn't have that bustling with business feel or sounds like the original has). Our waitress did not smile and seemed genuinely angry when we needed a minute to decide on food and when we told her we were sharing. Not real cool. We shared a salad, breadsticks, and a calzone. The salad was fine (but the dressing tasted slightly off from the other restaurant), the breadsticks are totally different....like thicker and hard.... the calzone was bigger, but the dough used was not as tasty as the dough at the original location. I still gave the place 3 stars because the food was decent, but, needless to say, I would never choose this location over the original. 


PS: The BF asked me if it was fair to compare this location to the original (because, honestly, if there was not an original and better version I probably would have given this place a 4) BUT I do think it's fair because even if it is different owners, they are using the same name and so, in my opinion, they should have consistency in their menu, prices, and service..... Just sayin.....Saw a live band at Crabby Don's. 
This was the first time I've been to this little dive bar. 
The location was pretty funky - graffiti art on the wall behind the band. 
The bar seemed fully stocked top to bottom shelf.  For a small dive the tap selection is AWESOME.
Since it was really loud, we ordered from the Bar Keep with a series of hand gestures. It was funny but very effective.  

The bar is technically two pieces, one side for live music and one side for the "drinking crowd" 
I also saw that they serve food, which I wish I had tried some, because it smelled pretty good.

Overall, it was a dive bar, with a great beer selection.Now if you like cheese this is the place for you. I almost always order something different and so far my favourite is the Seafood Relleno. A bit odd with the seafood, but it works. Swimming in cheese, luckily its easy enough to push the unwanted cheese to the side. After doing so, I finally get to the pepper itself and all the goodness that it is stuffed with.

The salsa is always good and comes with some hotter salsa that you can either mix with the regular or eat with the warm tortilla chips.Like others have mentioned, this place is tucked away in a strip mall on the SW corner of Val Vista and Baseline behind Arby's and soon to be behind a brand new IHOP.  I've driven past this place 100's of times and never even noticed it!  

Stopped in on a late Sunday afternoon and there was steady traffic in and out and for carry-out as well; always a good sign to me.  We were seated in a comfortable booth right away and it wasn't long before they brought us out chips and salsas.  The chips were warm and the salsas were mild!  Even the little cup of "hot" salsa had barely any heat at all.  Even the wimpiest of spice haters wouldn't even know it was "hot".  I mentioned this to our waiter who was quick to offer the "REALLY HOT Habanero salsa".  It was hot, as hot as I expected the other stuff to be, and certainly not as hot as other habanero sauces I've had.  It did have a nice taste and I'd for sure ask for it next time.

I had the seafood rellenos and they were okay.  Covered in sauce and cheese, and more sauce and cheese I had to dig through to find the actual relleno.  Seafood here really means shrimp, and there were a good amount of small shrimp under the cheese and sauce.  The actual pepper had a nice taste, and the pico de gallo served on the plate was cool and spicy.  Serve the relleno/shrimp with 1/2 the sauce and cheese and twice the amount of pico de gallo and I would have been much happier.  The beans and rice were good and served to sop up most of the sauce when I ate it the next day for lunch.  Portions are huge!  The margarita was tasty and guacamole was okay.

I'd probably stop in again for a margarita and try something different from the menu.  Had a comforable atmosphere and a nice sectioned off outside eating area as well.  Overall, everything was just okay, nothing special, not bad, just not particularly memorable.Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their "Burger Daze", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!Grew up in Phoenix but spent the last 10 years in LA where my food expectations have skyrocketed. I thought this place would still offer viable competition but the food was just okay. I think it's perfect for the audience so it's smart business making but nothing really exciting or original is going on here. They've stuck  to the basics and do well so can't fault them for that. 

Desserts are strong. The Salted River bar and the fruit tart were delicious.I went there last Thursday for breakfast with a friend. I love the area and the décor of the restaurant. I ordered the Sicilian Scramble. I thought the portion was a little small to be honest. It tasted good, didn't really blow me away. Like previous reviews mention is the time it takes to get your food. It was a Thursday morning at 8:30 am, there was 1 couple in line in front of us when we ordered. After finding a table, I noticed every table had a number on it, meaning they were still waiting for their food. It probably took a little over 20 minutes to get our food. If you're in a hurry I would not recommend this place. I will return but I think they should find a way to speed up service. I did take a look in the kitchen and it looked like there was only 2 chiefs in the kitchen, that could be the problem.I liked my chicken pasta. But for $15, I expected a bigger portion. It seemed like more of a lunch sized portion than a dinner portion.Went around 1pm on a Saturday for lunch and was surprised to find nobody waiting beforehand. The restaurant was half empty when we were seated and waitresses were kind enough to check up on us the minute we sat down. 

I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad which was over seasoned with a special thai seasoning. With the dressing on the side, the salad tasted like pure sodium. It was not my favorite dish. But the omelet my lunch date ordered was decently sized and seemed to please him quite well. The cinnamon roll we ordered came out later than our meals due to our waitress' confusion. She apparently had problems with the frosting machine cause the entire plate was drenched in it. Some may have found this welcoming but it was quite disappointing to see one of my top five indulgences be presented so poorly ... haha but taste wise, it was pretty enjoyable...although a little too sweet due to the unnecessary amount of frosting. 

Overall, cute restaurant. Family friendly.~~~sticker shock~~~

Three of us ate here and we all really enjoyed our sandwiches...in fact they were darn good!

                                     ~~~sticker shock~~~

We passed the sandwiches around and shared so we could all try each others.  The prime rib was very good (no sticker shock for a prime rib sandwich), the club was very good and the patty melt was very good.

                                    ~~~sticker shock~~~

The bread was very good and all the ingredients were high quality.

                                   ~~~sticker shock~~~

A soda is nearly $2.50 and we got nickeled and dimed a bit...leading to us trying to figure out how 3 sandwiches and 2 sodas came to nearly $40 bucks!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sticker shock~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Decent restaurant.  Nice food, nice people, not great enough to go our of my way for but good enough to stop at if I was driving by.It's Safeway.  What can I say?  This one is typical of Safeway.  Usual range of products, typical pricing, etc.  Nothing special compared to any other Safeway.  They have good sales sometimes, especially if you use their smart phone app.  Some of the store brand products are pretty good, including their deli soups.Breakfast was very good. We had eggs, bacon, pancakes, hash browns, and also tried the biscuits and gravy. Hash browns tasted fresh, not the nasty freeze dried stuff from Denny's. The restaurant is not fancy but was clean. Service was excellent.It's a farm - they sell overpriced home made goods so they can continue farming - I get it.  - It was a good experience for my kids.  The peach pie is $17.00 but very, very tasty.  You decide if it's worth $17.00.

OPPORTUNITY:  They REALLY need to recycle at their events.  It's hot and everyone has bottled water - I expect them to show more responsibility.  They use solar power but they don't have recycle bins - That was a big dissappointment.We had been talking about playing Johnson Ranch for about a year, and this summer we finally got out there.  We figured you can't beat $25 for a Saturday morning round.  The course looked interesting: the front nine is a fairly typical tract, snaking its way through a residential community.  The back nine winds around a desert butte.

When I got there, the first thing I noticed was that the GPS was ghetto (and after I paid an extra $1 for it, of course).  And it turned out to not even work.  The other quirk I noticed right away is that they ran out of ice boxes on the carts, so the lady in the bar gave me a plastic bag full of ice.  Fair enough.

There was a tournament before we got there, so they started us on the back nine.  There are three or four really interesting holes on the back nine, with some drastic elevation changes as it winds around the mountain.  The front nine wasn't bad either...the fairways were wide open.  The greens were in good shape, although they weren't the fastest in the world.

The biggest problem with this course is that they don't take care of the fairways.  Grass was dying all over the place, and on some of the holes, as much as half the fairways looked yellowish brown.  This was incredibly disappointing, considering it's otherwise a pretty decent course.Not the best sushi, but good for Chandler, AZ.  Came here during lunch and service was quick and friendly.I've had a few good experiences here, getting my mountain bikes serviced. However, last time I was in there. the service went from professional to amateur. I simply wanted my old pedals and odometer swapped off my old bike to a new one. The young kid helping me kept telling me they were slammed with weekend work tickets. No problem, I was planning on leaving the bikes at the store. This was Tuesday a.m., wanted the bike back end of day Weds. He kept telling me there was no way they could promise that. Fine, but this was a only 20 min job. I don't fault the young kid, he was just doing what he was told. It was his boss/manager, working on the computer, who seemed thoroughly annoyed with every question the kid would throw his way about my needs. Not once did he seem interested in helping me, nor did he even take a moment to turn around to greet me and behave like a manager or professional should. 

I left and took the bikes up to Bike Masters at San Tan mall. Scott told me he would be happy to do it right now. They also had bikes they were currently working on, but he went out of his way to take care of me in less than 20 mins. I expected to leave the bikes and pick them up later. This was above and beyond.Decent neighborhood restaurant. Use to go there about once a week. Usually order the taproom steak with the string beans & basil tomatoes. Last time I went to my surprise they no longer have there delicious string beans that they sauteed with mushrooms & onions, instead they had flavorless steamed broccoli. I asked the waitress why they no longer had them she didn't know but said a lot people were complaining. also my steak was dry & overcooked. My husband ordered the fish & chips but usually orders an extra piece of fish when he is really hungry because the portion is on the skimpy side although tasty.I snuck in here on late evening before going out. I ordered off the HH menu. I wasn't overly impressed or disappointed.

The bar was packed with late 40's and 50 yr olds which seemed kind of weird to me. Don't get me wrong, party on, I encourage it. It was just weird having 35 middle aged folks partying at the bar on a Wednesday night and my girlfriend and I being the only ones sitting at the tables.I've met a friend here a couple times because she likes this place and the hot stones they use.  Personally, I'm a little more picky about nail salons and as a former massage therapist who used stones during treatment, these were awful.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anyplace I'd recommend either.  My polish started chipping at 3 weeks and they never do a great job scrubbing my heels.  Cleanliness, which is my pet peeve, was OK.

Places like this are a dime a dozen.  You just have to shop around to find one you're are comfortable with.  I'm still looking.I came here because I could not make it to my usual place. Okay for a quick visit but I probably will not go out of my way to visit again. Very friendly staff but there was a little bit of a language barrier and so I did not get exactly what I wanted.The deli itself is good, and the chicken salad is great, but the price tag is a bit much for a local place. It's always a shock to get a $25 charge on three things at a deli...I grew up eating deli at Canter's, Factor's and Jerry's in Los Angeles, this makes me a deli snob. I am, a deli connoisseur. In Phoenix, good deli is difficult to come by.  I ordered the pastrami on rye and matzo ball soup, standard deli fare. The sandwich was pretty disappointing; it was greasy (despite the fact that I ordered extra lean pastrami) and the bread didn't seem fresh or homemade. The sandwich was also not as high as I like to see my deli sandwiches, stacked only about 1/4 inch.  I have no significant complaints about their matzo ball soup, except that it was scalding hot. The final disappointment came in the form of their pickles, or rather a lack there of. One of the many reasons I lust after deli is because I live for traditional deli pickles. The pickles at Goldman's weren't good either, they seemed strangely similar to Claussen's brand, and they were pretty stingy with the pickles in the first place, we had to ask for pickles throughout the course of our meal. In general, Goldman's is decent deli that I would absolutely eat again, but my quest for amazing deli in Phoenix continues.Why doesn't this store change the title to Barnes and Nobles instead of Bookstar?? The B&N sticker is on the windows.. Very strange. 

Found lots of clearance items when I entered the store. It was so exciting to peruse through calendars, books, and Christmas items. I bought a Christmas toy since it was too cute to pass up.

I went into this store at 8:30pm, and was surprised that it closes at 10pm. Anyway, lots of books at this store and the store workers are friendly.I generally don't come in here to browse, I buy most of my electronics, games and DVDs online. The reason I come here is to pricematch other offline retailers.

My specific reason for coming here while I was visiting my parents was to pricematch a Family Guy set and a Wii game against Circuit City, as well as picking up a GPS unit for my father that had been ordered online.

Online pickup went smoothly - the item was ready to go and promptly served up and the desk was adequately staffed so there was no line.

The store was laid out like any other Best Buy, but I actually couldn't find the Family Guy after checking the normal section and realizing there was a specific Fox section. (is this general knowledge? I'm guessing this isn't Best Buy's vengeance against Fox since I've seen it at Circuit City as well, but why would you make your box sets harder to find - do people really have such strong brand identification?) I still had no luck in the Fox section, although I found where it should have been.

Going against my instincts of avoiding contact with staff in big-box retailers, I asked an associate who was helpful and checked the promo areas at the head of the appropriate aisles and found one for me, which was appreciated.

When I went to pay, lines were minimal (again, adequate staffing) and the cashier needed manager approval for the pricematch. The manager was in disbelief at the Family Guy price, but approved it anyway without any actual difficulty. Distrust by managers doing a price match tends to annoy me when I'm doing something legitimate that is within their stated policy, but to her credit, the way she stated it was careful to at least appear to state that I'd casually made an error in interpretation of the ad, not that I was intentionally trying to mislead them. Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity, as they say.

This was one of my better Best Buy experiences, but I'm still not compelled to start shopping there more frequently for anything not on sale unless it's an emergency as one can get cheaper prices online.In a pinch Ill go here as I generally buy ALL of my electronics and such online.. the staff is friendly (couple of hotties don't hurt either) and seemingly eager to help. 

As far as brick and mortar retailers go, I think their pricing is pretty good. It seems like just yesterday I was in front of this store at 4am in line to get a Wii.. fond memories indeed.Mr. Handyman's business model is smart.  They are excellent in customer service, especially with answering calls and scheduling.  Much better than some of their competitors.  Their handiman, (who has come by twice) does do great work and there's little to no flaws in that.  The only reason this isn't higher, is they do charge per hour and try to book appointments that last more than 2-3 hours.  Our handiman was a little condescending as well.  I may still call on them because they actually respond and do very good work. (this includes dry wall, fan installation, basic plumbing, etc...)Unfortunately, in Scottsdale you can't find a freakin' Pizza joint open late.  This is the only option for us in the part of the city.  We've ordered delivery from this place at least 5 times over the past year.

They're always on time, so that's a bonus.  However, the Pizza is good only about 60% of the time.  3 out of the 5 orders we've placed were decent.  The other 2 times the Pizza wasn't as fresh.  Another time they forgot our dipping sauces.  Here are some photos from the best Pizza we had:

That day, they were firing on all cylinders.

Return Factor - 100%...Because we have no other late night options.I stopped in because I searched Yelp for "carne asada fries" and this was the closest place to my hotel.

It's not much to look at from the outside.  And really, it's not much to look at on the inside.  But we're not shooting an HGTV episode here.  I'm here for the food.

I ordered up an order of the carne asada fries along with a mexican coke.  I sat down in one of the booths to wait for my food.  The guy called out my order in short time and I went up to grab my food.

Full Disclosure:  This is only my second time trying carne asada fries.  I first them in San Diego a few months ago and just loved them.  So now I'm on the lookout for them whenever I'm west of the Mississippi.

I liked these fries.  The ingredients were a little cheaper than what I had out in SD, but it was still pretty dang tasty.  If you put french fries, guac, steak, and cheese on a plate, I'm a happy man.  The serving size was huge and I ended up taking some of it back to my hotel.

If I'm back in town, I'll definitely try to make it back!I flew into Scottsdale yesterday to spend the day with my aunt who turned 90.  Having a hankering for real deli, we chased on over to Chompies.

I had a half corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.  The tasty corned beef was lean and thinly sliced and piled high.  The rye bread was soggy on the bottom.  The lean corned beef is probably healthier than the marbled kind, but that is what you can get in LA and New York and it is sooo good.

The matzo ball soup had a few carrots and noodles, but the soup itself was nothing to write home to mom about.  The matzo ball was fluffy and comfortable.IMO, Chompie's gets a solid 4 for food.  I have never not had a good meal here.  Sandwiches are intense - brisket and turkey is my favorite.  Great knishes...  Overall, really decent deli and great rye bread.  :)

My complaint, and why I dropped the star, is that I have also never not been wrongly overcharged, or had them get a take-out order wrong.  This happened today, in fact, as I was in buying a lot of Mothers Day pastry.  And I was charged for items I didn't receive.  Same thing always happens with deli takeout too, though more often, they get the order wrong.  Of course, you don't realize this until you get things home, and you'd think I'd learn to double check before I leave, but the place is always a bit of a madhouse.  

Good food, but if you do take out, check things before you pay.  They seem to have an issue with not getting the items and the bill to coincide.I have wanted to like Chompie's so much since I'd heard good things but most of my experiences have made this place mediocre, at best. 

There is seriously nothing-and I mean nothing-healthy on the menu. No vegetarian options, no whole wheat bread. Even the salads are all made with 90% iceberg lettuce even when advertised as "crisp greens". It's so easy to make a really good salad, I'm not sure why theirs suck so bad. On my most recent visit I got a bowl of split pea soup and it was probably the worst split pea soup I've ever had. Too salty and otherwise boring. 

The baked goods are pretty good, but it really depends on what you get. The bagels are not all that great, but the honey bran muffins are bomb. 

**Note: avoid visiting the University location which is riddled with loud, sometimes trashy college kids.Tried this place for the first time. Ok menu would have been better with more options. Food was good with a lot of great flavor. Would dine there again but would get it as take out.3.5 stars
Service is great here! The food was okay. I was recommended to order the Seared Ahi Tuna salad and although they had removed it from the menu, they were nice enough to put it together for me and another in our party. The tuna part was ok but the lettuce had much too much dressing to eat. The mango pieces were a nice touch. We also ordered the Spinich Dip Yelpers recommended but it was nothing special.After walking in I was half greeted by 3 girls in white shirts at the front.  Unnecessarily snotty I might add.  It was lunch on a wed. Almost full restaurant but we managed to get  seats in the bar.

Our server was good. He was pretty attentive  about keeping up with refills.  Nice touch with the frozen glasses for sodas.  Seemed knowledgable as well.

I ordered the California seabass.  Was a little like halibut.  Seemed a bit dry as did my friend's swordfish.  Both needed a lot of sauce to make up for the dryness.  The spaghetti squash side was undercooked but still ok.  No one really enjoyed the little tomatos doused in olive oil they serve with the fish.  Everything seemed just drowned in oil or butter.    Nice selections on the menu though.  I would definetly give it another shot.  Hopefully the guest services girls at the front lighten up a little bit though next time.My wife has always liked Houston's (for a chain, she says), so we finally went together recently.  I admit the ambiance was nice, quiet and subdued, but our server and my dinner were very underwhelming.  I had the Hickory Burger, but I consider myself to be a sort of hamburger connoisseur, so maybe that was too much pressure to put on Houston's.  My wife still enjoys it there though...so we'll probably go back again.Large selection at decent prices.  Disappointed that they had Dbacks gear but not the NL Division champs t-shirts.Massage was great, but only 3 stars because the common area is not seperate from the men.  We share a sauna, steam room, hot tub, etc.  I wasn't thrilled about having to wear my swimsuit and having men stare at me.I really struggled with how many stars I should give this review. I went here with my mom for a spa day a couple weeks ago. We enjoyed our day but the facilities are just ok. 

The reason I gave it three stars is because the girl who did my facial was great. I think her name was Leah?? Hopefully I am right. She was lovely.

The steam room was just ok. The steam is preset to go off at regular intervals but for my taste the intervals were just way to far apart. Towards the end of the cycle I felt more like I was in a hot yoga studio, not a steam room. And I love steam rooms so I was a little disappointed. But even the quality of the steam room needs some updating. Several tiles are cracked. One side of the steam room is a constant puddle due to the inconsistency in the floor. I tired not to step over there because water that never drains just seems like an invitation for bacteria. There was also some white substance in spots on the wall that I am not sure what it is. Leftover soap not rinsed off, growth, I don't know? 

The pool and hot tub area are basic. They have some big trees overhead so I try to give some benefit of the doubt with all the leaves in the pool. However, it is much harder to overlook the edges of the pool and hot tub that just seemed grimy. I think the pool service might need to scrub the edges a little more often. 

I won't go in to extensive detail on everything because I don't want to feel like I am beating them up. It is a nice place. It just maybe needs a little more attention to detail, cleanliness and some updating.

I would recommend getting a facial here. However, I would recommend going with realistic expectations. This is not going to be as nice as one of our local spas but it is a nice way to spend the day.It's a park with a big lake, a very big lake. Nothing stands out here too much, the running trail around the lake is good, but you must use the far parking lot at a point because the path is not a full circle. All types here, families that fish, dog people and lonely seniors too. An oasis in the desert so to speak, but you can't drink this water.This is a pretty good place in a good location.  I liked the two pools, one with volleyball and two spas.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.

My biggest gripe is the lack of high speed internet and/or WiFi.  The "high speed internet" was downloading around 24kB/s.  Terrible.  There is no WiFi in the rooms, and if you could find it within the hotel, it was very slow and spotty.

I ate the breakfast buffet here every day and it's pretty good.I am only reviewing the conference facilities. the location was close to home, so we picked a continuing education course hosted at the Doubletree. 

the auditorium style room was terrible for temperature control...it was a very steeeeeeeep auditorium. the provided sound system was also lackluster. 

that's about it. not a great room to have a conference.No wireless ? You've got to be kidding.  Thank goodness for a hotspot connection from my HTC G2.  I also didn't enjoy the mandatory msg from the hotel phone, insistently beeping until we listened to a long rambling message about checkout procedures.  I have fond memories of this place from the early 90s, and it hasn't changed much, which is both good and bad. The staff as always is consistently nice and very helpful.  A low-scale renovation is rolling across this hotel, so I hope it updates what has become a Scottsdale institution.Still one of the best places on earth to buy toys and video games.  Their selection is great and usually they have great sales right before major holidays.Very nice location with excellent service.
Pros: Customer service, beautiful interior and exterior, comfortable and well designed rooms, excellent food, good prices and awesome valet. 
Cons: If you're a light sleeper like I am, you'll wake up a lot. 
Ceiling creeks at night, guests can be heard through the walls and people start getting up at 5:30 am. We stayed on the second floor, so maybe that's isolated for the creaking ceiling. 
I'd stay here again because of the service.In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... 

During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day). 

In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!Nothing to really wow about. The rooms and staff are nice. If the price is right, you won't be disappointed.

The best part is the complementary breakfast and the 4th Floor Grill ensure you won't have to leave the property to get a good meal.This place is OK, not too flashy, but OK. Our family of 12 called an hour before for reservations on a busy thursday and managed to get great seating without a wait. The waitress was phenomenal, totally on top of her game and didn't batt an eyelash when she kept being sent too and froo by various sections of the table (we tipped her really well). However, the food was slightly above mediocre. My potatoes were overly cooked, and the sausage tasted wrong. My omlette was also tasting strange and was rubbery. So service was wonderful, but the food was meh.Surprisingly good! Was expecting the typical greasy breakfast platter but they have a variety of selection from healthy egg whites to thick rich gravy. We tried the bisquit w gravy which was pretty tasty. Bacon was ok... Nothing to rave about. Otherwise everything we ordered was good and at the right price. They even leave you a pitcher of water and coffee so you don't have to keep asking the waitress for refills. No wait for seating even on a Sunday for brunch.Just another average strip mall in Arizona....but like a lot of the establishments there it will benefit greatly from the new Salt River Fields spring training facility there especially during the month of march when there will be tons of visitors in town for spring training games. While your at the Pavilions though don't forget to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!I like this place!  Others have complained that the food is bland, but I beg to differ.  The lunch special is a good (not great) deal for 8 bucks, and the salad toppings are bountiful.  No - you're not going to find extraordinary quality here, but for those days when you can't make up your mind between a few different places - its a good spot.

Go for the soups.  There will be six or seven of them, and I suggest you try at least two.  On their menu, they list over 100 different soups that make the rotation and they're creative.  While I've only been here once, the day I visited I found one vegan soup, and two other vegetarian offerings.  All were very good.  My buddy told me the mac n cheese was good, too.

My chocolate muffin was great, too, and the frozen yogurt was a nice surprise.  The foccacia was a bland disappointment, but overall - not bad for the price and exceptional when you just can't make up your mind as to what you want to eat - but ya gotta be in the mood for soup...Stopped into this stylish, comfortable Sweet Tomatoes today for lunch.  There's always something new to try here, & today's exciting item for me was "Joan's Broccoli Madness with Bacon"  This was a raw broccoli dish that was really tasty & different!  My other favorite things today were the Albondigas Locas Soup, the Chicken Dijon Soup, & here's a surprise:  the Pepperoni Pizza!  Yes, it was good!

This is a nice lunch at a fair price:  $8.39, $7.55 Sr.Pretty well kept for an older store.  Use the self checkout for a speedy in and out.My husband and I went to Devils on Friday night for happy hour, the martinis & appetizers were 2-4-1, so 9.50 for 2 martinis, which was a good deal. We tried the French Devil, Grape Lemon Drop, and a Passion Fruit martini, The Passion fruit one was better than the others. The appetizers were also half price, we tried the sliders, crab cakes, and chicken quesadilla, none of the appetizers were any good, we ended up trying a bite, and leaving the rest. The chicken in the quesadilla and sliders were dry & the crab cakes were tasteless. The martinis were ok, but not that great. The music was good!It's hard finding good Chinese food. This place is pretty good.

I had the king pao chicken and it was good but could use more kick to it. The rice and egg rolls are pretty good. 

The lady at the counter was very friendly, which is nice. 

Overall, good Chinese food at a good price.I can say that everything that I had here was pretty damn good. I went for my birthday with my husband a couple of months ago.

We had the onion soup to start which tasted so familiar.....we both decided  that it tasted like the broth in BEEF TOP RAMEN....hahahahahah. Not necessarily a bad thing...

Then we had some fried rice, chicken, shrimp, and steak....all very yummy. No complaints and the cook we had was super cute !!! Always a plus. 

We shared our table with another family that were very nice and social and they had a birthday girl in their party also. They gave us a hilarious pineapple boat for a birthday treat, sang a song, and took a picture. 

We had a great time and the only reason that I gave 3 stars is because we spent a shitload of money in here and I was stilla bit hungry when I left.I understand the inflated prices on the entrees surely factor in the "entertainment" factor, but I still can't help but be underwhelmed by the food at the end.  Our server and chef were great, but I would have felt differently about spending $35+ for my meal had it not been for the birthday voucher.The gyros meat is delicious but the pita at times throws everything off by not being super fresh. 

What I will say rocks at this place is the gyros salad. I've never seen one with such a generous portion of gyro meat. Delicious dressing too.Good price. Good food. Good service.  One of the better breakfast places around.  Skip I-Hop and Denney's.  Come here!There aren't many sushi restaurants with high-quality ingredients and a well-designed menu selection in the area; this is one of the better spots. 

But OH MY the server, a young woman I'd bet was used to getting by on her looks, took more than 40 minutes to bring our sushi combo platter and roll. I actually had to get up and ask her where our dinners were before she brought them, sans apology. 
Drinks were slow too. 

And in case you're wondering, it was a Friday night dinner, but an early one. The place was not busy enough to excuse the service, even a little.I have been here several times.  Food is always good and the service always sucks.Good food most of the time. I have not had a bad meal there. It does not wow my socks of or anything but I would go back for sure. The owner is a bit of an idiot at times, drinking and hitting on girls in the bar is pretty inappropriate but I guess he can do what he wants.Ok food here, probably living a little too large off the tourist traffic in Keirland Commons. Had the fois gras raviolli, it was pretty so so - not enough goose to make up for all the pasta; the duck consume with it was very good. My wife's French onion soup was good by her account, I thought the smoked gruyere cheese overwhelmed the flavor. The main course was good, pretty small portion though. I had the RACK of lamb, which was two cutlets with a couple of bites of lamb belly. Both had a nice taste. My wife had the short ribs which were pretty good, had a nice slow cooked taste to them. For dessert we shared the beignets, which were very average. And where I previously read that there French press coffee was THE bomb, I thought it bombed. It hardly had a coffee flavor, it was made very weak. Overall, I'd give Zinc 2 1/2 stars.They now have smaller lunch-sized portions (which are still enough for two and average 1300 calories). But it's still a smaller portion and a smaller price on top of that. 
Service is always excellent - staff bends over backward for you. How nice is that at a chain shop??The food here is okay but I can't help think that this place is a master of none.  The draft beer is standard fare.  The service is okay.  The menu is large but the advertising just looks tacky to me.

I ordered the gumbo which seemed to be more like jambalaya.  They don't even give you a spoon to eat it.   

They have added a skinny menu which is nice to see and the women in my party liked the items.  Obviously they are moving away from the large portion thing.  

The cheesecake, as always, is great with a large selection to choose from.  I just wished the server would stop bashing the smores choice.  We liked it.I haven't had nearly the poor experience the other reviewers had, but I also never go in expecting much. Everyone I have spoken to was pleasant, and a couple helped me find things I needed. They always ask how I'm doing and if I need help and seem fairly genuine about it. Checkout isn't bad at all, they always seem to have enough cashiers to manage the line of customers.

If you want to feel appreciated for your purchase of higher end products (Urban Decay, Clinique, etc.), to go a department store or even Sephora. Everything else is drugstore brand/quality so why would you be expecting the white glove treatment for $7 mascara?I have heard great things about Flo's restaurants, so imagine the excitement I felt when I saw Flo's Asian Kitchen across the shopping center at dinner time!  

We decided to check it out and, to sum it all up, the service was fantastic, but the food was a bit of a let down.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't find any of the dishes to be anything more than average.  The sauce with the crispy & spicy chicken was salty and lacked any real heat.  The chicken itself was prepared fine, but it was not unlike any other chicken breast that has been pounded, breaded in panko and fried.  The green curry was good, but I there was not enough coconut milk in the recipe and the dish was very heavy on the onion.  I also wished there was more of the green curry sauce....lots more.

The service is what redeemed this visit.  We were greeted and then seated immediately after we entered the establishment.  Waters were brought to us with out having to ask, including a small cup with a lid for our daughter.  Our server was completely on the ball with taking orders, refilling drinks and checking back with us to make sure we were taken care of.  The service she provided was good enough that I might be willing to give Flo's Asian Kitchen another go....maybe.We've come here several times for lunch, as it's close to work. It's mediocre. I'm a vegetarian and they don't have a ton of options -- they have the usual stir fry veggies, veggie lo mein, veggie fried rice. I opt for the crispy tofu and veggies with brown rice. 

I'd suggest to STAY AWAY FROM THE TEA. Their iced tea is gross, and probably a Nestee product. They don't brew it, and if they do, I don't know what kind of crap they use. My only gripe with Flo's. 

Overall, it's an average experience with Chinese food -- for an average lunch price ($8-11)I know, I know...it's way past Easter, but I had travel and meetings and whole pile of things to do and I just didn't get a chance to review Easter at the Westin Kierland until now.
So here it is in one well chosen word...easy!!!!
We got a suite at the Westin for Easter.
Neither the Beautiful Carin or I had to do a friggin thing for Easter, except show up...Starwood Resorts did it all. They cleaned up after everybody, they provided games and fun for the kids, big screen plasma HD TV to watch the Master final round, and a great spot to do it all.
The pool was nice and warm (as I understand it...way too many people and way too cold for me to go swimming...I let the flatlanders have the pool).
Instead of Deseo or room service, we all brought along eats (I did my world famous beer can chicken and dirty rice...there is no bigger fan of my cooking than me:) ). 
I know I said we didn't have to do a thing, and we didn't "have" to, but I enjoyed the cooking and I didn't have to clean up, so good deal!
We stayed at this resort before several years ago at Christmas, just before we moved to Arizona, and we liked the place then and we like it now (it does seem to be the holiday redoubt for us, so that may be a trend).
No golf on Easter (except for the Masters on TV), but I have played all 3 nines at the Kierland many times and they provide a pleasant golf outing (a review for another day).
All in all, a good way to do a relaxed and relaxing holiday.The Rack in Scottsdale, has a great selection of brand names for an affordable price.  The only thing is that the staff is not friendly or helpful.Like the sister store, Upper Crust Pizza, the wings are VERY good.  Very neighborhoody feel - a bit mroe downscale than what you'd expect 1 mile from Scottsdale Road in north Scottsdale... but if you can get over the ambiance, the wings were very good, among the best I've seen in Phoenix.  It feels like the old pizza and wing bars back in Buffalo NY!You must like country music and dancing if you go here.  I've been here twice for drinks and dancing with my country-lovin' friends.  I've never eaten here.  The drinks are A-OK, but the people (late night folks) seem to creep out of the crazy pictures on the wall.  Let's just say I try to hide in the corner so no one asks me to dance!Not bad for the store itself, great location and it's within easy reach from SR-51 & SR-202 on the corner near Scottsdale Rd. & Shea Blvd.  This store even opens 24/7, which is a plus if you need something in the middle of the night and can't get it anywhere else.Didn't feel like cooking Sunday night. The assembled horde were hungry. Decided to order Italian and have it delivered from Guido's. Then, later that week, we all wanted to watch the CWS-NYY game and I had a hankering for eggplant parmigiana

Sunday, we ordered a margharita pizza, sausage pizza, garlic bread w melted mozzarella and marinara and cheesecake for all. The second time, we ordered eggplant parmigiana, antipasto, fried calamari w marinara, a couple of subs and cheesecake for all.

Okay, for starters, I understand that any restaurant-delivered food is not gonna be as fresh as it would be in their dining room. That said, the food from Guido's was pretty good on that score. The delivered food was reasonably warm or reasonably cold depending on the item. The spaghetti accompanying the eggplant was al dente.

Other than the calamari -- it was over-breaded, soft and overdone -- everyone was delighted with their dinner. Except me. But, that's what I get for ordering seafood in Arizona. The pizzas were warm, but a little light on the sausage topping. 

The cheesecake was especially good, a nice-sized portion, reminiscent of NY cheesecake. The filling was creamy without being too heavy. Guido's cheesecake has a very thin graham cracker crust. 

Be warned: there is an 18% service charge for orders delivered. If this food was served in their dining room, I'd knock them down a star. But, as for delivered pizza/italian food, this is about as good as it gets.Don't get me wrong, this place is tasty, but goodness sakes, did I seriously just pay that much for a hot dog that tastes like the $1.50 ones at Costco down the way?Friday for date night the hubby picked the restaurant.  We had movie tiks @ iPIC for later that night so this was close and somewhere we hadn't tried.  We made reservations the day of and headed into Scottsdale.  We arrived a tad early and had to wait a few minutes.  Lots of smaller tables for the two of us were available but could have been reserved for other parties.  We were greeted by who I can only imagine to be the owner and the hostess.  Both were trying to do the same thing.  Several waiters gave us the stink eye and I'm not sure how much I enjoyed that part while waiting.  

We were finally seated and waited a while for someone to take drink orders or explain the specials they may have that night.  Bread was dropped off.  Literally just thrown on the table and water delivered.  Napkins were placed on laps (which didn't make sense - if you are going to throw bread @ me - don't feel obligated to place my napkin for me)  anyway letting it go....  Our waiter finally came over.  He was either intimidated, on drugs or truly just couldn't be bothered by our table.  He couldn't look me in the eyes the entire time while rattling off the specials.  He would look outside - up @ the ceiling - down @ the floor - other tables - anything from looking me @ directly.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and he went on his merry way.  We waited a while for everything to arrive.  

My melon and prosciutto was amazing.  Perfect sweet to salty in every bite.  Yummy.  DH ordered the gnocchi.  There are no words that I will ever be able to use to explain this stuff to you.  It was like butter.  If you've ever had cotton candy and experienced it when it melts in your mouth.  Without the sweet.  This is what this gnocchi tasted like.  It literally melted in your mouth.  No chewing necessary.  Just savoring it all.  The white sauce with the ever so slight bit of red sauce to accompany it was PERFECT!!  IT was soooo delish.  Two days later he wants to go back for more.  Buckets and buckets he says.  I ordered the lasagna and Josh ordered the tortellini.  The lasagna was pedestrian.  It was ok.  Nothing like the gnocchi.  And the best part of the tortellini was those mushrooms.  Man those were delish!  It was sooo good.  

There was a couple celebrating what I have to assume was her b-day next to us.  We were treated by Mama Tutti coming over to her table and singing to her in Italian.  IT was terrific.  What a treat.Love RA.... This RA is small & has a cramped feeling to me compared to Chandler .. Love sake sangria... The sushi .. All good:-)Fun Americanized sushi bar.  Usually packed with a 30-something crowd at the bar.  Loud music.  Sushi is average, but what you would expect from a place like this.  Service is good.  If you want drinks with some sushi on the side, this is a great place.  If you want authentic, try Hiro Sushi instead.The wife and I are hanging out at Kierland doing the window shopping thing and it's time to eat.  Sushi sounds good!  Oh' look it's RA Sushi!  (Ok so we rarely have a plan...)  Just so happens it's happy hour and there is some live event being video taped for channel 3 TV.  Place is packed with silk and the men who love them....to our amazement we were seated right away albeit next to the kitchen but oh well...

RA is a place for redefined sushi, tetaki, sashimi and assorted japanese style choices...we tried most of their specialty plates from the happy hour menu and a couple of signature rolls from the menu.  I tried to dislike the food, but, it's good!  And you cannot beat the prices for happy hour!  

Turns out the taping was a charity event for a young man battling cancer, proceeds from a special menu were being donated by RA.  Kudos for that!

RA isn't my kinda thing but I would go back for happy hour or late night...the scene is a little too moda LA for me.This place is nothing special but it is special.  It has a very unique clientelle who are very loyal.  It reminds me of one of those places you see in TV where the working stiff's pony up to the bar and order a shot and a beer (beer and a bump) from he weathered looking bartender.  The food is pretty good. I had some kind of deep friend mushrooms stuffed with bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon.  Yum!  The beer is served in a football shaped glass for a touch of "dive bar".   The off track betting draws the old and tattered crowd who are living one day to the next and having a good time doing it.  The servers here are VERY nice and some will even call you "honey".  Don't ever second guess one of them though because they are on the ball and will be insulted if you second guess their order taking ability.  :)I'm always up for trying some handmade Italian food, and I went to La Torretta for the first time. The north Scottsdale spot is pretty from the outside, with twinkly lights adorning the exterior of the restaurant.

Inside, the spot is really nice, with big murals of Renaissance-style figures covering the walls. Tables are covered in linens, and there's a lounge-y bar area with a single TV in the corner.

Both my companion and I noticed the place was pretty quiet despite being full of people-maybe it's because it gives off a romantic vibe. There was some Frank Sinatra music playing in the background, though, which was a nice touch.

After a great meal a week before at Tutti Santi, La Toretta had a lot to live up to. My first impression of the food was the bread, which was ultra-crusty small pieces of a baguette served with packages of butter. It didn't taste super-fresh, and for how classy the atmosphere was, the foil packages of butter was a turn-off.

We ordered the Mozzarella Caprese and Bruschetta ($9.99), one of my favorite dishes, to start. The portion for the price took me aback, considering I had seen much more generous plates at other spots. To get only two small pieces of mozzarella was sort of shocking, and my favorite part of the dish was the bruschetta. If I go back to La Torretta, I would try to order a full appetizer of bruschetta (it's not on the menu, but maybe they'd do it.) The bread had an amazing flavor and texture to it because the heaping hunks of tomatoes perfectly saturated the bread.

My entree was by far my favorite part of the meal. It was the huge Tortellini con Ricotta ($18.99), which came in a cream sauce covered with mushrooms and peas. The dish was gigantic-I could only eat half of it-and every bite of the tri-colored pasta was delicious. I really, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you go.

My dining partner got the Ravioli Farcitti dell'Aragosta ($25.99), which was the lobster ravioli pictured here. He said it was great.

Finally, there was the Tiramisu ($8.95). It was served with whipped cream on the side, which I found odd,  and topped with strawberries. It was super-cold in the center and didn't have a strong coffee taste, but I did enjoy the cream part. The dessert just wasn't as traditional as I would have liked-I like a ton of espresso soaking the ladyfingers, but it tasted good and was served up generously.

Maybe it's because the place was pretty busy, but we noticed the service from our bartender/server was pretty slow. It could have just been because the spot was going for a laid-back vibe, but just be prepared to take your time throughout the meal if you go.

There are definitely some tweaks I'd make to create a better experience at La Torretta, but I would go back for the atmosphere and that amazing tortellini dish.This place has good bagels, but tepid service. I get bagels to go, and the last time I was there the kid making the bagels had no food service gloves on, and was taking money, making bagels, etc. Not the end of the world, but it does kind of junk you out. Another odd thing is that when you like your bagels double toasted, for some reason they put SO much butter on, it's almost like the bagel is deep fried. I haven't been back since the kid had poor food hygiene practices, but I need to get back there.Let me start this by saying that the place is ok. The food is decent and the prices are ok....maybe a little on the high side for some of the dishes considering the location in an old strip mall.  However, my judgement of their prices must take into consideration the plethora of overpriced mediocre pretentious restaurants in the Kierland area.   My experience with Italian food is from growing up in San Francisco and eating at the neighborhood Italian joints, including those in North Beach. Also I have traveled Italy extensively.

I had the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and one meatball.  The soup was pasta e faggioli.  We also had an order of garlic bread.

The soup was ok. The pasta in it was rigattoni that was properly al dente. That was promising.  The beans had the right consistency as well. The soup however, was not quite as hearty or flavorful as I've had in the past. Still, I would recommend it.  I'd give it a 5 out of 10.

The spaghetti noodles were of decent quality and just slightly past al dente.  Perhaps it's because americans like their pasta a little bit softer. The pasta I've had in Italy was really al dente.  The sauce was tangy but there was really little meat. I thought it was plain sauce until my wife pointed out a few spots of meat. To me, that's not really a meat sauce.  I like a sauce that has a bit of a kick to it.  This was more of a tangy  crushed tomato sauce. So overall the dish was a 5 out of 10.

The meatball had a lot of filler in it. It tasted good but you could taste the filler. But the bottom line was it tasted ok.  I'd give it a solid 5 out of 10.

The garlic bread was bad. Do NOT order the garlic bread. First of all, the bread was plain bread shaped like a roll. That's not proper. Get some good sourdough with a good crust at least.  There was very little garlic taste and it was not toasted enough.  Go to Ernesto's on 24th and Clement in San Francisco. They make GREAT garlic bread and it comes complimentary.

The service was earnest but plainly there is not enough wait staff. On a Sunday night, there was only the cook, one waitress/busgirl and one server/greeter.  It took forever to get our check. They were nice but plainly overworked. The solution would be to hire one more waiter.

Ambiance is meh.  It's an oasis considering the horrible shopping center it's in. But it's not North Beach Capp's Corner.  Throw some candles on the table at least. Spice the place up.

Clearly though, this restaurant has a following. It's usually crowded. I guess people need a casual place to eat away from the silicon breast and botox crowd over at Kierland Commons.

I will return again to try some of their other dishes and report back.Nice friendly staff, Good food!  Gets busy quickly.  LOVED the  Meat Sauce!  Will definitely will stop again to try something different. This time I had the veal cutlet which was a veal patties and not "real veal slices" but it was good. I would prefer to had the real thing though for the price of $ 15.00.  

CASH ONLY so leave the plastic at home.It was good.  The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, the pasta was good, the meatball was very good.  It is not overpriced, and it is not a great deal.  Service was good.  If you want to have a simple, relaxing, pretty good Italian meal at a fair price, and atmosphere is not all that important  to you then give this place a try.We're still at 3 stars. 2.5 if I could. 

We were in over the weekend for Soup, Salad and Bread Sticks. It was an interesting experience. While our server was over the top nice, she was also over the top awkward. She tried so darn hard to be good but it left us all feeling uncomfortable. I won't go into many specifics but she needs to tone it down and just let us enjoy our lunch without a bunch of theatrics. (I will not leave her name)

We received our salad first and when that came my father asked for our soup as well since we prefer having them together. We all finished our salads and sat there for a while before we received our soup (despite hearing it was coming multiple times). 

When we left we all stood there in shock at how uncomfortable that lunch was. Between the server and a few other events. We will not be back to this location.I remember the Red Lobster when they used to be incredible.  Now, they are just middle of the road.  They have become what they are:  a restaurant chain.  But my son loves them [he's 8], so we go there from time to time.  When we were younger, we went because the food was good to decent, and it was relatively inexpensive.  However, the food is still good to decent, but their prices have crept up to the point where they are no longer a bargain.It's a Dollar Tree, so I really didn't have high expectations going in, and I'm wasn't overly disappointed.  It's loosely organized, mostly stocked, and staff are rare except to check out.  Not a big selection of items, but again it's a Dollar Store, not Target or Walgreens.  I don't typically shop here, and just went in with my wife looking for a particular item (large nail clippers), which they didn't have in stock at the time.  I do appreciate that they actually stick to the $1 price tag, versus other "dollar" stores that do not.This is good clean fun.  The best part to my story was I was willing to lose all my chips just to get to the bathroom and I just kept doubling up on the tables.  Thanks!I have never in my life seen so many people at a casino except in Las Vegas for: NBA finals, Rodeo, and New Years Eve. This was a Wednesday night! I think almost every single slot machine was taken, there were some with obvious lines.
I began to play this winless blackjack where I got a blackjack on the first hand and it didn't pay blackjack money. Of course this was some indian casion rule where they show you the dealer's hole card in exchange for awful terms. YOU ARE ALWAYS JUST SUPPOSED TO ASSUME THEY HAVE A TEN.  SO that game sucked.

Their video roulette is okay. Of course this is where the degernates sit and play. After about 20 or so spins, you hear how they "just bet" every single number that just hit, but not this last time. 

They have a nice little cafe there, with some pretty good food. The cheesecake is OK. THe Chicken sandwich is good. The money is in the Steak Fries. Those were pretty good. You can also play about 100 games of Keno at once, so you can sit and watch that while you eat. 

Lastly, I think you can just go ask for free tickets to "showstoppers" it is first come first serve, with a 2 drink purchase. I've heard it is pretty good. 
No comp booze? What kind of law is that?Several steps up from Fort McDowell, several steps down from Talking Stick.i go to this depot too all the time because it is right across the street from work. so when i'm done with my paying job, i drive across the street and can pick up stuff for my non-paying job. 

pretty standard depot....unless you vigorously hunt someone down for help, you ain't gettin any.Being from California, the sushi was alright. Nothing that blew me out of the waters. But what I did appreciate was the service and how the restaurant was owned by Japanese people (instead of the Korean-owned sushi places that is everywhere from East Coast to West Coast). Service itself was excellent. Our hostess was very attentive to adjust to even the smallest changes to our party's requests. Sushi, on the other hand, was served at a varying rate which I found a bit annoying because some people got their food really quick while others had to eat after the rest of our group had finished eating. The quality was good but I have found "good" elsewhere also. I'll probably give it another try after I explore some other restaurants.Totally solid.
Really.
Reason it's not five stars... is the price!
IMHO, there are other sushi bars in the PHX area, that are just as fresh and tasty, and not as $$$$
I ended up spending $75 on food and drink, including tax and tip.
While it was tasty, it wasn't that tasty.  I can find better for $30.I come here when I need I need my fried mushroom fix.  I think they buy their mushrooms because when I get a large mushroom, the inside is still frozen.  The good thing is that they are not stingy with their ranch...very generous.  Hubby usually orders the philly steak - they're just ok.  Chicken wings are large and very good.  Service is always good.  Overall, its an ok place, not outstanding.So, Goldie's is the "sister bar" to Zipps.  Personally, I prefer Zipps over Goldie's, but it is nice to go somewhere a little different sometimes.  We usually head straight upstairs where they have 2 pool tables, Big Buck Hunter, Golden Tee and a dart board.  We went here last night for our Buddy's birthday celebration.  He and his wife live right down the road, so it's super convenient for them.  The big difference to me between Goldie's and Zipps is the quality of food and sometimes the service.  We had an order of wings and they were still pink inside and I ordered a Monaco Foccacia, which was really dry.  However, the Goldie-rita was really good.  It was strawberry.  Super delicious.  Another issue is that there is only one server upstairs and there must have been at least 75 people at one time up there.  It's not really her fault for that, but at the same time, she wasn't that nice or personable to us when we got there.  After everything died down and there were just about 20 or so people, she was showing the guys how to do push-ups (the guys were betting eachother earlier on how many pushups each of them could do).  That was kinda cool.I think sometimes reading reviews first is not a good thing. Like Melaney I was happy that I found a place with a high rating and close to where I was. I had a mediocre experience, the staff was okay and my pedicure was decent. I think $26 for a kids mani/pedi with a flower is a bit much.... maybe because I got such awesome treatment and prices at my nail shops in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga. Needless to say I will be trying another nail shop while I'm out in AZ.I don't normally frequent the "chains" cause I like to give the locals the biz, but I had a gift card, and I took my daughter.  

It was early (6:00) on a Sunday, and there was a waiting list in the dining room, so we ate in the bar.  Taylor was the bartender and server.  I told him what I wanted to drink with not too much this and not too much that, and he made it perfect.  Thank you, Taylor!  I had the shrimp portofino and my daughter had the lobster ravioli.  I am only giving the four stars cause I thought the shrimp should have had some kind of flavor to it -- It was a bit on the bland side -- and my daughter's ravioli was a bit on the sparse side.  That being said, both dishes were good.  The pasta was flavored to perfection.  I wouldn't have minded having chili peppers on the table cause I like my pasta spicy hot, but that's okay.  That's my taste.  The hostess forgot to give us menus, and Taylor, our server/bartender was surprised at that.  Slight oversight, I'm sure.  No big deal."It's a chain. It's fondue. BUT perfect for the right occasion. I would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates. You get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on. Pretty pricey however."For the price you're better off buying a fondue pot and doing this at home... plus it can be much more romantic.  I'm never a big fan of chains, and although this one manages to gain points from the atmosphere standpoint, the prices just don't justify food that any novice can make.  If money is no object and you want someone to serve you, there isn't anything "bad" about Melting Pot.Visited from out of town on a one day pass. It was ok. The space is very large but there isn't all that much workout equipment - a lot of the space is devoted to the basketball court, overlooking the court, personal training areas, the café, day care, staff offices, etc. They didn't have any equipment one wouldn't find at a run of the mill gym. The locker room is humongous and well-appointed.My wife and I arrived for lunch and unfortunately were greeted by a strange burnt smell lingering in the main room.  Luckily they have outside seating so we opted for that.  With the misters outside even the +100 degree heat was pleasant.  

The menu looked solid and interesting.  I opted to have a cranberry chicken salad sandwich with a cup of gazpacho soup.  My wife chose the curry chicken salad over greens.  The gazpacho soup was pleasant and especially nice on a hot day.  Both of the chicken salads were a bit underseasoned but otherwise were tasty.  They had that homemade characteristic to them however we both agreed we could do better at home.  I thought the wheat bread on my sandwich was really good -- nice and nutty with a sweet touch.  We ordered the iced tea for our drink which matched our expectations.

Overall this place seemed solid but nothing special -- a nice neighborhood cafe.  The service was good but not great.  I do recommend this place and would come again but I didn't feel it was good enough to earn 4 stars.  Too bad I can't give it 3.5 stars.I had lunch here the other day. Not bad. This review is probably going to be a bit incomplete.

The service was kind of useless though. We had to wait several minutes just to get a freaking menu. No one really came by to check on us.

I ordered some sort of pita wrap which was very tasty. It came with a side salad that had no dressing on it whatsoever. I also ordered a side of grilled chicken breast. 

If you come here, sit on the patio. It's nice. Don't come here if you are on an hour lunch break. You will feel rushed. You need to come here and be at a relaxed pace. Maybe on a weekend. Or a weekday if you are unemployed or wealthy with no life.

I need to come back to get a better experience, and maybe order something more memorable.This was the first Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that I tried.  It was close to home, we had been shopping all day, and decided to try it for a late lunch. I was disappointed - not because the food was bad, but because it wasn't much different than most of the Mexican restaurants in Spokane.  I was hoping for something more adventurous, more authentic, and not the Americanized Mexican food that is prevalent in Washington.

That said, the food was as advertised, and was good for what it was.  The lunch special price was pretty much standard for the area, and the servings were large.  I did look at the individual items on the menu, and noticed the prices seemed high.  But since this was the first restaurant that we went to in Scottsdale, I just figured it was the area. The service was good, and the waitress was very friendly.

To show how unimpressed I was, this is only about a half a mile from my place, and I have yet to find a reason to go back.  Again, the food wasn't bad, but I would rather drive to restaurants with more authentic and adventuresome recipes.We went there this past Saturday evening. The place was very busy, but we were seated on the patio pretty fast. Music was nice. The service was non-existent and we were noticeably ignored by several waiters on the patio for
more than 40 minutes- we were getting ready to leave when a server finally asked us if we were ever served.  Then the manager apologized and a waitress appeared.  Food was very good.A lot of my Midwest friends rave about how good their burgers are, being from California I've never had the opportunity to try one, until today.

Immediately I noticed the size of the bun, this thing is huge! I enjoyed the burger and fresh ingredients, the bacon and jalapeño added a great touch to the burger. I guess I'm spoiled in California with options such as habitat burger and burger city , i would not say this burger is better than In-n-Out or Fatburger , sorry friends. 

Customer service was nice, I liked how the cashier comes to your table with all the different sauces you can have. Tried the spicy ketchup, has a nice mini-sized kick too it.Ajo Al's is just OK, its nothing fancy or different from any other mexican restaurant. The Queso dip is AMAZING, The Chiicken pollo con queso is pretty good, be warned though, it is overly stuffed with dried chicken, and some of the chicken is basically a HUGE SLAB OF CHICKEN. 

It's a bit of a busy place, so be prepared to hear everyone's conversation thats within hearing range. 

Servers are friendly, and you are served with water, chips and salsa within seconds of being seated. Just don't get a seat close to the bathroom, in the bar, or close to the front door. EVERYONE will be in your face.What a strange bunch of reviews for this restaurant.  Of course, you always get a few people who had a bad experience, sometimes because of something the restaurant did and sometimes because they just had a bad day.  And of course you always find a few people who LOVE everything.  But the mixture here makes me wonder if there aren't two restaurants named Ajo Al's at this address, or perhaps a time warp, virtual reality, or witch's spell.

The truth is -- Ajo Al's is an average old-school Mexican restaurant.  The chips are ok, the salsa is ok, meaning if you are hungry you'll eat them.  Some of the entrees are good, but you have to know what to order.  I recommend the chicken enchilada, which is overflowing with white meat chicken.  Some entrees are just decent, like the beef tamale -- lots of beef filling but it had a lackluster flavor.  The beef tacos are ok, the rice is ok, the whole beans are ok.

If you just need a quick fix of standard Mexican, and Ajo Al's is conveniently nearby, I don't think you will be seriously offended.  If you want anything more, this is not your burrito, amigo.Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was decent. 

They basically have two vegetarian items on the menu that aren't salads: guacamole tacos and garden fajitas. I wish they had something like a grilled veggies burrito or something to that effect.

I ordered the guacamole tacos and they were just ok. The guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix. I guess it's personal preference but I like guacamole to taste fresh and like avocado. This tasted like garlic and had a weird consistency. The tacos came with a side of beans and rice, which were REALLY good. 

The chips they give you tasted like they were from a bag and also not made in house. 

Next time I think I'll try one of their salads.Random stop this AM as I saw the door wide open and they had decent breakfast deals. Ordered the small egg, bacon and cheese on an Italian roll for under $3. This was a decent breakfast sandwich, eggs were freshly made, bacon was a bit dated, but cheese melted nicely. The bread was the best part overall and it was a different way to start the day, which is exactly what I was seeking today.Service was really good... Food was so so... I would not go backThis place is decent, but not quite what it was yelped up to be.  One reason is they give 6 bagels in exchange for a positive review. Bagels are good, but the lox and breakfast burrito were just ok.LOVED the "hot" wings.  I rarely find one that is truly "hot" but today I met my match.  Good thing I didn't go for the "extra hot".  This comes from a girl who always carries hot sauce in her purse.  ;-)

Good food.  Love that you can get half fries and half onion rings.  Typical sports bar.  Good drinks although they didn't have any of my faves on tap.  Nope, no Guinness on tap.  Overall a great place to watch "the game" and enjoy some good bar food.The rooms are big and equipped with everything you need. Almost too big! 

There is a nice pool that was packed!

I took two stars away because of the customer service. The girls at the front desk made a HUGE deal about us wanting to use the shuttle. We were only going a short distance away but too far to walk and the girls made us feel pretty bad about it. 
They also made a half attempt to ask us how out stay was. She asked as we were halfway out the door and she was braiding her hair.......From me, the Chart House gets 5 stars for location and ambience, both of which are very sadly lacking here in Scottsdale.

Unfortunately, what is also lacking in Scottsdale is quality, and the Chart House suffers a little from that as well.   That is not to say that the food isn't good.  It is.  But it isn't something you will rave about.

But get a waterfront table in the evening when the candles are burning, have a martini, and enjoy the salad bar if nothing else!  The nicest overall experience in the area.

Update:  I returned to the Chart House about a year after this review.   And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service, I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food.   $30-$40 for a very basic seafood dish, and $16.00 for a nothing-special salad bar, are beyond the quality they are providing.

Further Update:  07/15/12:   Leave it to Landry's to destroy another fine dining establishment.   For 20 years I've looked forward to visiting The Chart House in many cities.   But it is now just another chain establishment, and with each visit, it slides downhill.   I must shed a tear and move on.  RIP Chart House.They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5HwMy cousin and her fiance had their engagement party here on the Patio which connects to the lake and park. Never having eaten here before I don't know if I got the best impression from the pre-prepared catered food. We were served their sliders, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and cheese and crackers. Nothing that could really make an impression! I thought the restaurant looked nice enough, but everything came off as a little bland.Our family of five just stayed at the Gainey Ranch for 5 nights and had a great time overall.  I was torn between a 4 and 3 rating but the high daily fee and charges for Internet access made me lean towards a three.  Here is what I would say are the pros and cons:

Pros: nice rooms, comfortable beds, great maid service. Restaurant was a '4', good food and not as overpriced as I would have expected.  Location worked out great for us, we went hiking and horse back riding 15-30 minutes north of the hotel and went to dinner in the downtown area just 10 minutes away.  Pool was great fun for the kids albeit as others mentioned a bit dirty.

Cons: we had two rooms so paid 40 per night on 'resort fees' and I could not think of one benefit we got from the fee.  They overcharged me for 12 for 'resort recreation' that I need to inquire about as we never rented any recreation items.  The Internet charges on top of a resort fee are just ridiculous, if this is the norm for all Hyatt hotels I will avoid them in the future.  The bigger con for us outside of the Internet fees was the rooms are not sound proofed at all.  Our neighbors got up at 5am every morning and we could hear their entire conversation.  The Hyatt also had a nightly concert/band (likely what our resort fee covered) and unfortunately the music was so loud we could not relax and read or watch.  The Hyatt should have forewarned us we would have been situated in a room right on top of loud music.  I would say bathrooms were a con too, one of our rooms had a standard showerDand the other had a very small bathtub shower/combo.

It was a nice hotel but I would not stay again unless I knew they had concerts and started offering free wireless.Yelp brought me here, as always!  I didn't exactly know what to expect of a place that calls itself Qwik (Chinese) - doesn't really lend itself to delicious, quality, or any other adjective that is the opposite of fast food.  

That having been said, the food was good!  I had some wonton soup and the almond chicken delivered.  The soup was flavorful enough, though there was probably more soup than ingredients.  The wontons themselves don't have the super thin kind of consistency, more of a thicker, chewy, doughy kind of texture.  I prefer the former which is why I brought this up.  Still good though.  The chicken dish itself was pretty good as well, using quality chicken (not that questionable, "is this rubber thing I'm chewing actually chicken?" taste).  Flavorful as well, and doesn't leave you with that greasy, grimy, stuck in the bottom of your stomach kind of feeling like most other chinese does.  

To sum it up I'd say this place has the intent of a more traditional/home cooked kind of chinese meal, but it's been tailored a bit for stateside consumption.  Won't stop me from going back though!It was an ok place to stay for Thanksgiving weekend. I didn't like that we had to pay a resort fee, especially when the rooms were already a little pricey. We had broken lights in our room we got charged a mini bar fee when we didn't even get the key. Now how does that happen? It was especially difficult to get them to refund it. I highly doubt I'll go back. All I can say is I'd rather stay here than Motel 6, but that's not saying much.I came here for a work event, imagine that. The rooms were clean and the property was in fairly decent shape. The staff was extremely friendly. The place itself is somewhat isolated from a walk to a restaurant or bar standpoint. But good if you are here to focus on work and meetings or perhaps relax with a good book for a weekend.We've been here multiple times now, but we stopped going a bit ago. I think we just thought that it was a bit grerasy? But I guess all Chinese can be greasy.

Good food and good prices. Would go back if I was craving Chinese.My daughter and I ordered take out only on a few occasions, each time wishing it would rise to the level of our native San Francisco favorites.  Alas, it did not, and perhaps that is an unfair comparison.  Bottom line, on the 3 times we ordered to go, the orders were incorrect when we arrived home.  The food seems to be fresh, but the preparations are not consistent, nor are they authentic Chinese. Bland and Scottsdalian.  I suppose the great reviews here, may be warranted my Mid-western snow birds who don't know better.  I am not sure great Chinese food exists in Scottsdale.It's clean, brightly-lit, and very close to my apartment, but why are the prices generally so much higher?  Maybe it's bec. of all the organic items they offer?  Organic or not, I hardly ever come here anymore, as I'd rather go to Whole Foods on Mayo for my bread and organic foods' fix, and to Fry's on Shea for the stuff my Mom wants.  It's nice to know that there's a grocery nearby, though.My friend and I stayed here last spring when we went out to AZ to visit our friends.

It was pretty standard as far as hotels go. We had a double queen room and it was clean and kept clean. 

The hotel's near a bunch of businesses including a grocery store across the road and was conveniently about ten minutes from our friends' apartment. 

I didn't specifically choose this hotel- it was part of a flight package on Travelocity. But I'd stay there again if traveling to Scottsdale. It was affordable and convenient!Im doing three starts for this place, not because the service (which was great the first time, but eh this past time), but mainly the food.

First time I went to this location, the food was so great.  I had ordered some baked ziti and enough to feed a small army. The taste was tremendous and I had leftovers for days (not really, but I dont want to sound like a pig).  The bread they brought out before hand was fresh and the drinks were perfect.

This last time...

We sat down and waited a while before the waitress came over.  After getting our drinks (good), she brought us some, what seemed like day old bread and luke warm marinara sauce.  My girlfriend ordered a sandwich and I ordered a calzone.  Im a big fan of calzones and have loved them.. well not this time.  It was pretty tasteless to be honest with you.  You would think a ton of cheese with sausage and mushroom would be good right? Nope.. I had to add salt to even flavor it up some.  I only ate about half.  Pretty disappointed.I got my lasik done here in 2007. The results were great but as time has passed my vision has faded no longer 20/15 as it was right after the lasik. Schwartz is professional and the staff was pretty good. The only negative is the price I paid $5000.00. He is probably the best in town but if I could go back I'd have done more shopping to try to find a better deal. His work is great but the price makes it 1 or 2 stars. So the work 4 stars price is 1.5 stars.This is your basic full service car wash. They run it through the exterior wash, give it a nice dry, and vacuum and wipe down the interior. I've been here a few times and it's always hit or miss. Sometimes you are in and out and others you will wait a while. It's pretty pricy too. I'd prefer Frances and Sons over Cobblestone due to these reasons.I really want to give them 3.9 stars, but not possible, and they don't deserve 4 quite yet until they do something about the food.
My review is based on yet another outing with the manfriend while he worked and I hung out (sweet!).  We stayed 4 nights.

+ 1 Star - Holiday Flair.  Marriott got their Xmas yayas out big time.  Big ole trees in the lobby and stuff displayed here, there, everywhere in the public spaces.  Tasteful but festive.
+ 1 Star - Fruit.  I am addicted to the fresh fruit in the lobby.  Yum I say!
- 1 Star (really minus two...) Food.  God Awful restaurant.  Breakfast is okay but price!  Ridic!  $16 for the "cold" option?! seriously.  And whatever you do, DO NOT order the pizza.  I had it for dinner and literally could not eat it.  Makes Dominos look gourmet.  Instead.....
+ 1 Star - Fridge.  No lame-ass overpriced mini bar.  There is a bar sized fridge that you can go to the Whole Foods nearby (10 min) and stock up with numnums.  Also good way to avoid the overpriced breakfast and the other meals (that are toxic).
+ 1 Star - Room size.  Out here in the middle of the desert, there is a lot of room.  So it's nice to see that they gave us a sitting room with rull on sofa, chair, coffee table-y stool things, desk, settee, little outside patio with two chairs/table, entertainment center, wet bar with fridge, good sized bathroom with 2 sinks and separate shower/tub.
Neutral Stars - Toiletries and such. I heart these guys for giving up the bathrobes (the room, strangely, only came with one, but asked nice housekeeper and she gave me more).  But where are my fuzzy slippers? And what's with the skimpy washing stuff - only 2 soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion. No bath gel?  And it's sunny here normally, so it would be nice to have sunscreen or some other "Arizona" type thing.
+ 1 Star - Flat Screens.  Cannot believe that the last 2 places I stayed had dino-tube TV's.  So I must start giving props for the flat screens to show some love to the hotels that are getting with the 20th century! Woohoo!  Also, they have some funky free programs on the TV here.  Check out "Jellyfish".  They are your friends.
- 1 Star - The Water Trick.  I hate this, personally.  Don't be such cheap arses that you put the water out (especially here, in a desert) with a $5 (!!!) price tag around the neck.  How about - 1st one free, after that you can order more from room service for a fee or something?  Ugh.  That is one of my pet peeves as is....
- 1 Star - Internet Charge.  Seriously?  $12 a day?  Come on people.  
+ 1 Star - Parking free.  Self park of course but valet .....
- 1 Star - Valet parking gouge.  Are you joking $20?  How about I will park some one else's car once and you give me free breakfast.  But not dinner.  Poison. Ugh.
+ 1 Star - Nice.  The people here are just so darn nice.  Geez.  It's like they all are on some sort of medication.  Nice nice nice.  Lalalalala. Nice.

All in all, would we come back? Yeah, we would if it's the only price-appropriate place at the time (this time was about $210 a night with tax etc).  Now that we know to avoid the dining room as much as possible, we are better psyched up.  But I think there might be some better options for us, so tbd in the future. 

Check out the following while you are in Scottsdale/Phoenix:
The Talesin House (Frank Lloyd Wright) - 15 minutes from hotel
Bikram Yoga Paradise Valley - 20 minutesI like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't tink they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live. 

I also like supporting local Arizona business.

The staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff.I visit this establishment with a friend that is getting Physical Therapy.  The PT. staff has always been nice and they seem to care about the Pt's. and they progress they are making.It's been a while since I've eaten at this location.  Was in the area for a quick lunch and decided to get:

Western Bacon Cheeseburger, $3.99
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-7628-scottsdale?select=1RONucdG2fUzaUSkPblGyw#1RONucdG2fUzaUSkPblGyw

Big Carl, $3.99
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-7628-scottsdale?select=vRfvthRQhtZoM-XXpUqokQ#vRfvthRQhtZoM-XXpUqokQ

The Big Carl has become one of my favorite Burgers at Carl's Jr.  The Western Bacon Cheeseburger is an old fav of mine....and is just OK.

This particular location does a good job of making a decent fast food meal.  It's also a very clean restaurant and the employees are friendly.

Return Factor - 60%Went looking for notebook binders I could get in Atlanta; no can do. Either this store doesn't carry them or they have been discontinued. When I asked if we could order the answer was it lloked like don't carry them so probably not - probably not?!

Had the other items I was looking for.Baja Fresh is not Chipotle Mexican Grill, not even close. But, what they are is a interesting upscale casual Mexican fast food restaurant. They were owned by Wendy's for a time, and Baja Fresh executes on their menu items more often then most, Qdoba comes to mind. 

The quality of the food is good, but only slightly above average. Their newer seafood items are very bland and clearly they were aiming at Rubio's (one of their misses).  Prices are fair, but their main unique entree is their Salsa Bar which is very fresh and also very good!

The problem for the chain is that their locations are sometimes across the street from a Chipotle, as this one is.  I like the chain, but if I'm in my car I might drive pass them and go to Chipotle instead.  Sorry!Concerning popular chains like Jamba Juice, the only reason factors that can push a review off the 3 star edge is the service, whether good or bad, or the food - whether they have a secret menu or they often screw up the recipe. This location really hasn't done any of that for me. I can get my smoothie in and out no problem, and the service is standard. 

This location does everything it needs to get by as a business, but nothing really outstanding has happened for me here.I usually get the 3 piece dark combo which is delicious. But I have to say those chicken drumsticks and thighs come from the skinniest chickens on the face of the earth. A couple of nibbles on the thigh and you're basically down to the bone. 

I think Boston Market needs to feed those skinny chicken models a little bit more. For the $9.67 they charge for that meal, which includes a drink; I think Boston Market can do better and I'll just have to go elsewhere for my chicken fix until things improve.You go in here at pretty much any time of the day and you would swear that they were giving away free food... the lines are so damn long! 

The burritos or bowls are good. The proteins are always pretty fresh... as you can see the staff cooking them right over the prep line.

Today's trip was slightly disappointing because several items I wanted were almost depleted in the serving pans, and I wouldn't let them use the "dregs" on my burrito. 

Be careful ordering the guacamole: It's a $1.50 for a "scoop". 

My tips: Try one of their Margaritas! They are interestingly pretty potent!My buddy and I go here and sit at the sushi bar and plow through some giant clams, tako salads, saparo's and yellowtail.  My friend is an ex seafood exec and is pretty happy talking fish to the chefs and tasting what's new.  I go along for the ride.  I like the atmosphere and the service is always good and the sushi is decent with a good selection.  Then we head to Chompies next door for desert!This is an average Wendy's restaurant.  It's very clean and the service is average.  We come here every once in a while with our Son to grab a quick bite to eat.  Here are some items we've had in the past:

Single w/Cheese, $3.59

It's a fast food restaurant, not much going on here.  As long as it stays clean and offers fast/accurate service we'll be back.

Return Factor - 60%Quick drive thru if you are on a lunch break, nice staff.  Went at an off time for a small fry and small frosty since I was hungry and needed a snack (~2 p.m.).  Fries were hot and tasted fresh and the frosty was delicious as always.

Parking lot is poorly designed, so it can back up into the main road, which blocks traffic flow and irritates other drivers.  It can also block you into a parking spot in their already rather small private parking lot and you will need to wait for a kind driver to not move forward in the line for you to be able to back out.  I would recommend parking in the lot close by and walking over to avoid this dilemma!Shopping - I hate it. Except for the PGA Superstore - but that is another review.  Anyway, we were hungry, so we decided a pizza sounded good. Nello's is in the same shopping center, so we decided a pizza sounded good - plus they had beer.  

The inside is neat, clean, and boring.  But we were there to eat pizza, so my wife had a spinach salad, and we shared a Grand Deluxe Pizza (pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions, black olives & mushrooms). And, of course, beer.

The service was excellent - we were immediately seated and a server appeared immediately to take our drink orders; brought them right back, and took our order. And it was only a short wait for the food.

My wife really enjoyed the spinach salad; and the pizza toppings were above average.  They pride themselves on their crust, which I found was better than average.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I found the sauce rather bland.

Pizza is really a matter of individual taste, so others may like the pizza much better than I did.  I will certainly come here again, and maybe upgrade my stars if the sauce is a little spicier.I dig the super dog friendly patio.
I really like the setup of the patio overall - it's a very comfortable space.
The menu has choices for everyone and portion size is way up there.

The food itself is OK at best - relatively bland, overall. But, it's bar food in N. Scottsdale, so I think that's par for the course. Nothing bad, just a little on the blah side.

The service...well, um. Yeah. The service. I think the only requirement for employment as a server is to be cute. They sure as hell aren't hired for any of the actual skills needed to be a decent server. Reminds me of the staff at Ra Sushi and way too many other places.

That said - it's still worth a visit! Just bring some good people to have great conversations with and the patio will be a lovely and comfy backdrop for that. And if you're patient and, well, patient - you'll even get some good drinks and decent food. Fido will even get a water bowl!I enjoy me some Mexican food. This may not be my favorite Mexican food place, but it's alright. 

The rice and beans are pretty good. I have had a few things from the menu and so far my favorite is the Pollo Fundido (it's called something crazy on the menu) and it's pretty tasty. 

Their lunch menu is great because the portions are just right and it's not that expensive, but it isn't really cheap. 

Overall, it's alright.This place is OK. It is a cross between Mexican fast food and a restaurant. The food is a little above average but I think costs a little too much. I would think with the volume of customers they have they could do better in both categories. 

My only real complaint is that the waitress asked "sour cream and guacamole on the side". This made it sound like it was included but just being placed on the side, as opposed to the top of the food. When the bill came it was $1.00 for the sour cream and $1.25 for the guacamole.I haven't been here in a while but my lunch was good on this recent visit.  The chips are fresh and I love their rojo salsa.  My two enchilada combo with rice and beans made for a nice meal.Four Peaks is one of our old stand-bys for lunch or dinner whenever we can't think of someplace else to go.  It's not super great, but it's a long, long way from being dull.  

Being a brewery, the beer is really good.  I always have the Kilt-Lifter which is excellent.  Lindsay always has the Peach beer and is always really happy.

Foodwise, I usually get the fish and chips or the French Dip.  Both are good - not great, but not bad.  I've also had their pizza which is also pretty good.

Just about every time we visit it's extremely crowded and super loud.  If you're out drinking and looking for fun, this is great, but if you just want a bite to eat and spend some time with the family it's not so wonderful.

Despite it being a hangout for the 20's crowd, this isn't a bad place to bring your kids.  I rarely see tons of kids, but there's always a few and we've always found plenty for our kid to eat.Typical - a good glass of beer and so-so food.  Also typical - the noise level - high.The husband and I ate at this location for the first time Sat evening. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer and they came out still cold in the middle from being frozen. When we mentioned it to our server, she apologized and brought out a fresh dish a few minutes late which were hot. We shared a pizza, it was good not great. Peach beer was delicious as always. Three star experience overall. Nothing terrible, nothing great.Sure beats Einsteins...The bagel and lox...not too shabby.  Bagels are a little more chewy than bready which is a plus!  Good coffee.Wildflower as a whole is a fantastic chain. I've never had a bad experience with anything the chain itself has control over. 

However, there are some things that, while not completely in Wildflowers control, only seem to have happened in this specific location. It's in the middle of a set of stores all nicely lined up... in a corner with a small parking lot for that specific section. This means that the parking lot is not so fun to navigate.

I feel bad stating this as it is completely out of Wildflowers hands but is still relevant to whether you should pick this location or not. If you get there early or at specific times of the day, it's quite nice and not a problem - unless it gets packed while you're inside, then it's a pain to get out. However, if it's a busy time, then be ready to not only have a hard time finding seats inside, but in finding parking as well. I actually have had it happen a few times where I got stuck waiting behind someone in the parking lot who's waiting for that one spot that's a few feet closer than the other three spots that are rapidly being taken by other cars, but because the parking lot was so narrow I couldn't get around the car. 

The inside gets packed as well, but even when it's slower and only has a medium amount of customers, it still has limited seating. This means that sometimes you are there with your family and need a larger area for them, but you can only quietly groan as you see anywhere that would be comfortable is taken and that quite a few of the bigger places to sit are occupied by just one person playing on their cell phone. As I've not worked for Wildflower nor known anyone who has, I don't know what the regulations are for instances like that, especially in today's age where common courtesy is rare and when a customers review/rating rule more than actual productivity of the place - so asking someone to move might could actually hurt the restaurant-  but it's pretty annoying that this happens and it happens a lot at this specific location. 

Basically, Wildflower is a fantastic restaurant. Their bread is fantastic, their soups are wonderful as well, and I really enjoy some of their salads. The restaurant itself is great. However, there ARE better placed locations that have better parking for your car and have better seating inside (so better parking for your rear too). I wouldn't say don't come here as the service is pretty decent (not fantastic but not bad in any way), but that if you can go to another location without it being inconvenient then I'd recommend it.If you look at the front, it doesn't look like a very appetizing place to eat, but my grandma dragged me in because she wanted Mexican food, and I guess I shouldn't judge books by their covers...to a certain point.  The inside was okay, just rows of booths. I have a thing about dirty places, so I think it should have been cleaner. I didn't dare go into the bathrooms.  We were two of about five people in there. Service was pretty good. I got the guacamole tostada lunch special with rice and beans. It was sooo good. My grandma got a chicken burrito which was good too. Their chips and salsa were BOMB.This place has been here for a very long time. They do a decent job but in the last couple years I have thought they have lost some of the quality of the food as well as the service. Many other Mexican places to choose from in the neighborhood.This is a non-traditional Catholic Church that our family will go to from time to time if we are unable to attend our regular parish.  It's very different than what we're accustomed to...so we don't come here very often.  It takes some getting use to and requires an open mind to adjust to the differences.  We always feel welcome here and that's what counts.

Return Factor - 50%Did a detail there, they did a good, but not oustanding job, but for a reasonable price (like $150).  Tons better than Danny's would ever do!

I've had other, better, details in the area, but they were closer to $250... so comparing the quality of the work versus the price, Airpark was a good/very good value.This theater is pretty basic - nothing more, nothing less. Movie tickets are $7 before 6p and $9 after, which I think is pretty standard. No stadium seating, but the seats are pretty comfortable & no one sat in front of me so I was alright. 

Was impressed they had a nice variety of movies - some foreign & indie films I hadn't heard of before.This was one of my favorite places to go when I was growing up.  We tried it recently because of my fond memories of it but it was just OK.  The steak was very high priced & I ordered the filet mignon.  It was tough & very fatty.  I ordered it medium, it was well done.  The drinks were weak & the service was slow even though it was a slow  night.  Too bad it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Glad its still there though.Scenic Golf Course
Even with a cart it is difficult to walk, cart paths are much higher than the greens
Very few flat lies on the golf course
The day we played the greens were probably rolling at a 6 on the meter, incredibly slow, the greens are very large and it is difficult to tell if you are putting up or downhill
Aside from the greens the course was fun to play
We got a summer deal and only played $30 so we got what we paid forI haven't yet stayed here, so will write more after my stay.  At this point, I am very irritated with this hotel.  I am going to be staying by myself in a room and my sister and her husband are staying in a different room.  My bro-in-law had to cancel and so I called to cancel my room, so I could stay with my sis instead.  They have a 72 hour cancellation requirement and I am staying there Friday night.  I called at 2:50 Pacific on Tuesday.  Because of the 1 hour time difference, the hotel REFUSED to cancel my reservation, even though there was only a 50 minute difference, so 71.2 hours instead of the full 72.  This IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Now I'm just hoping the hotel isn't stuck in the 1980's.

***UPDATE***

This place almost redeemed itself.  It was very spacious, with spectacular views and also very calm and quiet.  It's no wonder that they made me pay for that first night...the place was pretty deserted.  But again, I have no complaints except for the fact that it's pretty far from all of the bars, etc.  If you are looking for a place to stay that's serene and relaxing - - this is the place for you!Overall, we were pleased with this hotel and would be willing to stay there again for the right price.

We came to this hotel for a short two day "staycation" to celebrate our 8th anniversary. By deciding on this hotel, we were able to use the saved money (in respect to some of the resorts we were considering) to go towards our time at a nearby spa. We chose a "luxury suite" with a king size bed and separate living areas.

The rooms were interestingly designed in that two units comprise a small Adobe style building. Very pretty. You generally don't hear your neighbor unless they are overtly loud. Because these are independent dual units, you share hot water. You might find yourself having to wait to get in the tub/shower if your neighbor decided to use all the hot water before you.

The room was very clean and had a nice Southwest decor. We loved the fire place in our bedroom and the view of the surrounding mountains was very nice. The bathroom was very large and my wife really enjoyed the nicely sized jetted tub.

If you are getting away from the electronic world, this is a nice place. However, if you want to use the internet, you will find it to be very finicky and slow. We weren't able to watch Netflix movies on our tablet as hoped. The cable TV was also just as particular in that it would continually give us digital garbling.

The do have food available via room service, but as you can imagine, it will be extremely expensive. We chose to eat out for all our meals and brought some snacks back from the nearby Fry's and stored them in the units fridge. We highly recommend the nearby Dragonfly Café if you are interested in a wonderful brunch.

As for the hotel service, it was generally pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately, when the hair dryer broke (a mounted wall unit), they never sent anyone to replace/fix it as they said they would. In the mean time, my wife made do. (She would never have used theirs in the first place if she hadn't neglected to bring her own.) Since we didn't stay long, we didn't press the matter.

Again, we liked it here. It wasn't perfect, but it was nice. 

I should also mention that we didn't spend any time on the hotel grounds. We cannot review things such as their pool.We ordered takeout.... I think it's good for a Mexican place. However I was not blown away with the food quality or taste.

a lot of great reviews for this restaurant... I did not go in I just ordered takeout. But it wasn't that much better then a fast food Mexican place.

If you have a craving for fast Mexican food that is decent and then you can't go wrongTonight it was a bit chilly out side and I wanted some type of hot soup. I decided to call Chen's and ordered their WOR WON TON NOODLE SOUP. It warmed up my inner SOUL.
Wor means "everything", the soup had shrimp, won tons, sliced chicken, green leaf vegetables, sliced carrots and noodles. I picked up my order ten minutes late and when I got home...it was still piping hot, just as if it was just prepared. One thing, I wish there were more green vegetables.
So on a COLD night, I recommend this dish. You won't go wrong.After 'Love in the Hills' event on Valentine's Day, my wife and I decided to try and have dinner at Euro Pizza. We got there in time to be seated immediately. We sat more to the front of the restaurant and furthest away from a view of the fountain. So it seem we were in any typical restaurant, nothing special.

Our waitress was okay. Told us the special of the day  for Valentines, which I had. My wife started with a glass of wine and I had their Lemonade which wasn't that great. It didn't have that tart or sweetness flavor. My wife had a glass of wine and we ordered our entrees.

My wife had the 14" Classic pizza and I had the Valentines Special for $20 which included a salad, 8 oz sirloin steak with aspargus and pilaf plus a choice of desserts. 

My wifes pizza looked great and she thoroughly enjoyed it. On the other hand, the salad I had was pre-made. You can just tell that it was plated and had Saran wrap over it. It  was still fresh and with the Blue Cheese dressing, it was satisfying. My entree came and it looked pretty good. My steak was covered with brown gravy and the steak was cooked perfectly except it was pretty dense and chewy. I don't know if it was sirloin 'cause it looked like processed meat. The pilaf or gravy was WAY to salty and I just couldn't eat the pilaf. My 4 asparagus was cooked nicely. For dessert, I chose the Pecan Pie which was half the size of a regular slice of pie. I guess you get what you pay for. I don't consider my meal as a Valentine's Special but more like a Senior Special. Our total bill came to $46.

If I go back again, I would order their Pizza instead of their dinners because they seem more adapt at making them.nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.Nice chocolate, great icecream...... pitty that nobody behind the counter (3 people) actually looked like they wanted to be there at all! They were all pissy looking, not sure why. Maybe just an off day. 

Go and try the icecream though (icecream was better than their sorbets), especially on hot days, you can take it down to the park and watch the worlds largest fountain on the hour.Took the family here tonight they have a full bar and outside seating which is nice although we sat inside.  As you walk in you cant help but notice the many salsa awards propped up in the corner for both hot and mild salsas.  Although Ive had better I would certainly say that theirs is the best restaurant salsa that Ive tasted in the valley.  My wife ordered the pablano pepper and said it was a little spicy because it came with the seeds in it but she liked it.  I had what they call the Accupplulo Chicken or something like that basically a Chicken Burro with Cream Cheez Sauce on it.  Presentation was fair taste was good.  Kids had the beef tacos they where good.  Service and Pricing was Good.  All in all certainly not bad but when your salsa is better than your food you get three stars.  They also serve  breakfast and the prices looked very reasonable for Fountain Hills so we will go back to see if its better than the dinner menu.Just moved into the neighborhood, so thought we'd give Streets of NY a try. 

Decided to go in to pick up the pizza instead of ordering delivery. We didn't make it very far in, because they have a pick up desk just inside the door, but it looked clean and appeared fine (no sticky floors like one of the other reviewer mentioned).

I was disappointed to find that the sausage was little mini balls, I generally find that sliced tastes better - I am the one that prefers the fajita meat in her tacos, instead of ground beef, too.

I gave the pizza three stars because the dough wasn't as crisp as I like it. It was good, just a little too - um - doughy/soft for me. It kind of reminded me of the last time I had Dominoe's (which was ages ago).

I will definitely order again, perhaps I'll try pepperoni next time - they also have a good sized menu, so there's a lot of options.Out this Sunday morning doing a bit of GeoCaching, we decided breakfast was in order so where to go? I-Hop or Denny's ... Ok we decided on local so off to Denny's. Walked in, the place was about half full, greeted right away and seated. Coffee & water came out promptly, placed our order and our food arrived hot within about 5min. Service was great & food was good ...

Service: 4 star, our waitress was great, fast & friendly
Ambiance: 2 stars, casual setting, a bit dated
Cleanliness:  3 stars, appeared clean although lots of water spots on the glasses
Food: 3 star, food came out hot and well prepared
Price: 3 star, fair price's, my wife had a BYO Grand Slam for $6.59 and I had an All American Slam for $8.89The new digs are off Hermosa and Mill...so of course, I wanted to find a beer store or bar within walking distance.

As this is Tempe, the home of the "beer-soaked ASU undergrad", there are numerous choices.  Between 7-11, Frys and JP's Food Mart,  the retail outlets, as well as the Q and Brew along with Monkey Pants, Yucca Tap Room and Time Out Lounge, the choices are abundant.

JP's Food Mart is apparently intended to be the non-corporate Quickie Mart in the area.  There are numerous munchie choices of the 'prepackaged' variety, as well as cold soda, juice and water offerings.  The beer selection ranges from low to high-brow.

Prices are representative of most offerings in the Valley...between 10 and 20 cents cheaper than the 7-11 on the corner and more oriented toward single item purchase instead of the six-pack offerings at Fry's.

Probably the biggest consideration: the hours.  Sunday nights apparently have the most flexibility...generally closing 12:30 am...with Fridays and Saturdays around 1:30 am, while Monday-Thursday maintaining through 2 am.

Maybe the clerk has plans on Friday, Saturday and Sunday...?

As I am presently working in South Tempe until 12:30 am, it is significant that I might be able to find a beer to carry home about 12:40.  

Will keep you informed about the bars in the area as they become relevant.

BTW, credit and debit cards are assessed a charge for purchases below $6.50...so beware.First time at Riazzi's tonight. Had a celebration for 20 people. Table was ready as promised. I was first to arrive but waiter greeted me quickly and offered to take my drink order. There were already 8-10 parties seated at 5:30 PM -good start. 

As guests arrived, same good service was offered. 

Lots of different dishes ordered but I'll stick with what my family ordered. My wife sampled the antipasto salad and steamed mussels as an entree. Our daughter ordered from the gluten free menu and had the shrimp scampi with GF penne pasta and salad. Her husband ordered chicken piccata which came with a side of pasta and salad. Our youngest daughter ordered the spinach lasagne and I had the house special tortellini Riazzi pesto with a salad. 

The mussels were tender, tasty and hot. There were plenty of them (about 18) too. The GF dish - shrimp scampi and penne, came with gluten ingredients. I don't know if the waiter/cook got confused by taking 20 orders or not, but there was only one GF order for the party. She didn't get to eat anything. Our waiter was so busy keeping up with everything that he didn't even offer a redo until the table was nearly cleared. The spinach lasagne was huge, plenty of sauce and cheese. The piccata was done right, with lots of capers. The side pasta was rather boring tho. My tortellini was outstanding and I recommend it tremendously. Over a dozen big, tender pillows in a rich, creamy pesto sauce. 

I would have liked to give Riazzi's five stars but you can't mess with allergies. I would suggest he circle the GF order on the ticket, highlight it is something!Tried the 95 minute deep tissue massage with the new client discount (95 minutes for the price of 65 minutes).  It seemed like my masseuse used the 95 minutes to go slower at what a regular 60 minute massage would cover than to work on problem areas (upper back, neck, shoulders), despite my mention at the beginning that I have a lot of tension in those areas from working out and from my job.  She did mention that there were some knots to work out in my back, but she didn't make a lot of effort or put a lot of time to work the knots out.  As a result, my shoulders and back are still yearning for knots to be massaged out.  I went with a friend who had Anya, who said she was very knowledgeable and had very good suggestions on preventing further tension, so if I go here again I would probably request Anya.  The new client discount is a very good deal, since my 95 minute massage ended up costing only $79, and if you bring a friend next time you come in, you and your friend both get an extra 30 minutes free to your massage.Ok, I finally made it to Dilly's.  I can't say I was all that impressed.  The food was okay, the service sucked, and I don't really see what the big deal is about this place.

I grew up eating real deli food.   This, is not real deli food.  It serves a very limited selection of menu options.  For starters, you only have 3 choices of bread. I got a half sandwich and half salad.  The food was good, a notch above "decent."  Good enough to eat on a regular basis becuase its near my place, but NOT deserving of a special out of the way trip.

I dunno, I wouldnt NOT reccomend this place, but, I left unimpressed.  The Greek salad was good, the sandwich was good, but I feel like I left unsatisfied.Basha's definitely has a lot to catch up on as far as technology and the layouts of their stores. There prices are definitely a lot higher than Fry's and they don't have as much on sale. Sometimes they have a few things that will be priced really well. The thing that actually has me visiting Basha's every now and then is their Deli. They make pizza there for really cheap and even have meal deal specials every now and then. It is really fresh and their crust is unique in that it's kind of sweet. We really like it, it's definitely a better deal than getting a tiny $5 pizza from somewhere else. I also have to say that there service has also been great; everyone seems like they've been working there forever.My niece want to go here for her birthday, on a Friday night.  The wait was about 30 min.  

The onion blossom was not as crispy as I remember but still pretty good. Its horseradish sauce was stronger than I expected.  I had to ask for a side of ketchup.  

My steak was cooked as ordered (medium rare) but lacked taste somehow; the lobster tail was grilled right.  The steak of my niece was on the dry side (overcooked). My daughter's steak was as she liked it (medium rare).

For dessert, we shared a gigantic scoop of ice cream and whipped cream and an Oreo waffle with more ice cream and whipped cream.  We couldn't finish.

The service was good. Our waitress was very friendly.I've worked Arizona Mills for several years an have seen many sides to it. Before getting that job, I was hesitant to shop there because of the reputation it has as a lower class mall. But honestly, the place is clean, well-managed and always changing. Even if the targeted market is to the more frugal crowd, that just means great deals! Security is wonderful and each guard I've encountered has been friendly and helpful. The parking lots can definitely get a bit crazy, but that can be said about any busy establishment. I shop a lot on my breaks (it's a bad habit, but I can't help it) and always find something worthwhile. The Sanrio store is my favourite with all the adorable merchandise!It's ok. Prices or not cheaper than regular prices.I come here and go striaght to the gap, off 5th, marshalls, and the ross. Thats it. Lolz.This mall is literally 5 min. away. So, its where I like to shop because its close and convenient. I usually shop at the sports stores like nike, champs, footlocker. Also, hat club and burlington. It's not bad, selections in brand names are pretty good. The only downside are probably the bathrooms. It always seems to have that distinctive smell regardless of how much its been cleaned. Also, I noticed that they have redone the food court with more and better selections. Looks pretty fancy.Pong Pong, pretty good Chinese food for ridiculously cheap! They offer huge portions for small prices and they deliver for free! Gotta love that. I'm not going to say that this food is the best or will change your life but to get a huge entrée with sides for like $6 bucks or so...it's pretty darn good for the price. I don't eat Chinese food very often but when I have a craving or really want some soup I get this delivered. The staff is always very nice too.I enjoyed Pong Pong for exactly what it was, fast and cheap chinese food. I was not expecting a 5 course meal with all the trimmings but what I got was totally worth the price I paid. There were HUGE portions and the dish was spicy enough to suit my tastes and my boyfriends. Literally when I say fast I mean it. I was in and out of there in under 10 minutes and the food was piping hot!

The staff was quick and efficient, though not overly friendly. When I walked in the establishment was clean but definitely not modern by any standards. 

You get what you pay for at this place and when I want fast and cheap chinese food I will be going here again.I've been looking for a groomer for a while and have tried out a few. I decided to try shelly's. I call and someone answered only hello and just sat there I had to ask if I had called the correct #.  They said yes then quite again, I had to keep up the conversation asking if I could make an appt. And I was New that's when the lady finally was pleasant and wanted to help.  Then I show up for my appt and I felt rushed the lady didn't let me explain what I wanted with my dogs hair cut. also I have an allergy dog that has special needs shampoo she just took the bag and said ok  she didn't let me tell her the directions. I'm a veterinary technician so I now what my dogs need and after I picked my dogs up she needed to tell me that my dogs ears were bad but it seemed to be her tone more than anything.  The dogs looked good but the main problem with this place is the customer service which was horrible! I plan on trying them one more time hoping they were just having a bad day.blah... it was just blaah... ugh - our server was tired and wasn't that attentative... she tried to apologize but she kinda just trailed off... lol. But I guess its okay, but THEN... there came in a white couple and all of a sudden our waitress sprang to life!!

Uhhh... okaaaay??

At first I thought, great now she'll be attentative... ummmm... no. no she wasn't. I know that the East side of town is racist... ugh, I don't wanna talk about the ASU Bookstore Incident... Good grief!! 

This chick, I WISH I caught her name... was all smiles and giggles and then came to our table (which was only about 6 feet away) and was all frowns and excuses. It was sickening.

She failed to bring us our drinks, she only refiled them once and ignored us twice when we tried to ask for more water... okay the Iced Tea was too much for you... how impossible is water?? 

We had enough and were ready to walk out on the check when; I guessed she sensed our frustration and brought it to the table early! *harsh sigh* 

We paid in cash and got about $8 in change... which she brought to us in all ones!! omg, is she for real?? lol, I just laughed when I saw it... and I chose to leave a yelp card instead of any cash!Totally bummed to find out (once we got our bill) that this can no longer be the place we call home for our select happy-hour Friday night out. 

Beware that they have changed the rules to their happy hour.. Imports and select martinis got taken off the list.

Would really have been nice to know this before we ordered a few of each. Yikes... $$$. :-/I like the variety and the prices of Ross stores and this one definitely had a lot of merchandise.  We found a cute set of full bed size dinosaur sheets for only $10, 100% polyester, wash in cold water, tumble dry low.  I would personally prefer all cotton I could wash in hot water but my daughter was satisfied with them. 

We also visited the Marshalls and Burlington stores in the same center and I found more things I liked in Marshalls Store to be honest.
  
This store had a huge selection of pretty nice bras for pretty cheap prices too.  And for being late in the day, near closing, I found the store to be very well kept up, a difficult job I know with all the customers  disarranging the merchandise faster than it can be put back.This is actually the former location of this Goodwill Store.  I think it was about a year ago that it moved around the corner in the same shopping center to a larger, nicer location.  I used to come in this one but don't remember being real impressed.  I like the newer one. It's more spacious and usually more organized, depending on how many idiots go in and let their kids run wild in the store, taking things down, ripping open bags, losing pieces to games and toys, and leaving clothes all over.Let me explain the 3 stars.  I give LoveSac 5 stars for their product. Love love love it.  We have their Sactional series and think it is the greatest thing, great quality, fun to configure, soft, comfy.  So definitely you can not go wrong with the product.  

However, good luck dealing with the staff.   Every single time we have bought something, it is like having all of our teeth pulled.  It feels like they have no idea what they are doing.  Luckily, we have gritted our teeth and stood our ground, and everything has worked out each time.  

But on a recent visit, we were one of at least three customers in the store with complaints and problems in a 10-minute period.  Shouldn't they realize that if so many people are complaining, they should do something about their customer service?  Plus give more respect to repeat customers?  Order online instead to get the great product and have more control over your transaction!

UPDATE:  I want to say that  "Roy" has definitely come through for us this time and impressed us with his initiative; go Roy!  But this weird service issue has been ongoing since 2010.  So like I said, it usually works out, and there is at least one conscientious staffer, but in general the service is frustrating.LOVE the food, LOVE the ambiance, service is not impressive but friendly enough, but the bath room wreaks more then Chevron.NIce to hang out here (when it's not packed) and play chess, but I had to stop going because their CD player was skipping like MAD and they WOULD NOT TURN IT OFF. It drove me and my friends nuts. Every time we returned we'd think "they MUST have fixed it by now!" ...but we were wrong.

However, they did have some awesome breakfast burritos.Of course, the first problem with being a regular here is that you have to tell you friends to meet you at a place called Xtreme Bean.  It sounds like some horrible Taco Bell concoction.   Assuming you can move past the name, you might like this place.

I walked into the cafe and realized it used to be a bank which is sort of interesting, I suppose.  The associate (I hesitate to call him a barista) greeted me, "What's up bro?"  Though very informal, he certainly wasn't being rude.  That's a good way to summarize the feel of the whole place actually.  Aside from my "bro", none of the other 5 or 6 employees made eye contact or spoke to me.  

My latte was completely unremarkable.  That's not to say it was bad.  It was just a latte.  In fact, I'd venture to guess that I would not have been able to pick it out of a lineup of lattes from Starbucks.  

If you're in your late 20s early 30s, you might love the atmosphere.  While I was there, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, and Pearl Jam were pumping, quite loudly, through the sound system.  If you're not in that age bracket or just not a fan of classic rock- you might be annoyed.

There's always the high-speed wifi, which was very fast.

The entire place had a very corporate feeling to it.  I don't mean that as an insult.  It looked clean and well-calculated to create a feeling of coolness, if that makes any sense.  

I never did find the restroom here either.... not sure where it is.

Ultimately, not bad, but not great.  I'd rather drive 1 minute south on McClintock to Steve's.

--

UPDATE:

Even though I talk crap about this place, and even though it's really not very good, I still go there a few times a week.  Here's why: they're the only ones open.  Despite the fact that ASU is one of the 3 largest universities in the nation, our local establishments keep bankers hours.  Steve's closes at 10, Gold Bar at 10, hell, even the Starbucks nearby closes at 10 (9 on Sundays... 9!?  In a city?).  

So yeah, if you're awake past your bedtime, Xtreme Bean is pretty much your only choice other than IHOP or Del Taco.  And I'm not touching coffee made at either of those establishments.

Unfortunately, everyone else is in the same boat.  Which means, the baristas are in a huge rush most of the time (and, thus, aren't terribly pleasant) and good luck finding a good seat.  You're likely to be stuck in the "study room" which is woefully underlit or the main room which is frequently very noisy.

So-- crappy coffee joint, but the only game in town past 10pm.they are open late and that's the one thing that sets them apart from any of the other coffee places i go to. i'll stick with gold bar or even coffee rush if it's during normal hours, tho..Diclaimer: this review is for Xtreme Bean as a good coffee shop to study at

Can't beat free WiFi, good hours, pretty decent coffee drinks with a wide variety of options (including SF blended drinks!!), and helpful friendly service. Good amount of seating in and out. As a grad student, I LOVE the study room with desks!!! However, the outlets are hard to use unless you have a long cord... My iPad charger cord doesn't reach from the wall around the front of the desk, and there is no way to have it come up from the back of the desk. Only a few of the desks have good lighting (would like to save my eye sight thank you), and there needs to be a sign or something on the door stating priority to people who want to quietly study. That room and the study environment is what keeps me here... If I can't study, I have to go elsewhere, no matter how much I like a place. Every now and then, people who just want to socialize will use the slightly bigger table in that room... Not cool, esp if there are tables/seating in the other areas. Ruins that environment for everyone else in there. Hence the 3 starsAdd then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.

I have seen this type of grilling in the mall before but never actually felt the urge to dine there. I came here with friends who walked me through the experience. First of all, it is a stand alone restaurant. When you enter the door you pay $9 for the bowl and $0.50 for a togo box for your leftovers.  For the quality of food,  I think $9 is over-priced.  You are really paying a premium for the "experience" of watching someone sloosh around your food on a grill.  It is the express version of benihana.

You walk up to a buffet line and the first thing you see is a box of wax paper.  Those little squares they use when you get donuts.  You grab a couple sheets and proceed to the assorted meats (chicken, beef, pork) and a white fish (cod??) which were all frozen. These items are usually used for chinese hot pots. The quality is mediocre. Next in line are assorted veggies, tofu, and then an array of sauces.  You pick and choose.  As you fill up the bowl, people are using those wax sheets to moosh down the food to maximize space.  Add an item then smoosh.  Repeat.

The meal comes with soda, soup, rice, and frozen yogurt machine.  The best part of the meal was the service.  They are continually replenishing the ingredients and ensuring a cleaning station.  The cashier walked around to check on everyone's meal.  She even offered someone a new bowl since they didn't care for their creation.  That is service!  So even though the food was eh, the service made up for it.The Good:

*Produce is cheap
*They carry a wide range of milk alternative cheeses
*They have a lot of interesting products

The Bad:
On several occasions, I have experienced poor or weird customer service. A friend of mine accidentally knocked over a beer display and a couple of beers fell out and broke. Annoying I know, but the person who came to clean it up was openly irritated about it. Lots of loud sighing and eye rolling. I've worked in grocery before, and had to clean up entire wine displays that have been knocked over. Sure, I was annoyed but I would never treat a customer with such open disdain. After all it was an accident!Another venue not living up to their full potential.  I like that the venue and bar have seperate spaces and the outdoor patio/bar is nice as Im a smoker but lately they have been booking bands too large for the venue and you end up elbow to a-hole w/ a bunch of little kids if you want to be anywhere near the band playing as the over 21 fenced off area is about a 10 inch radius from the bar.  The bar staff is pretty laid back,  the security staff is kind of ego-maniacal meatheads that kick people's asses for no reason.  When i went to The Germs show someone got their nose broken.  Lots of blood.  Which, typically would be a normal scene for a punk rock pit but it was inflicted by the security simply because the kid told him to F off.

Liquor is kinda expensive but decent specials on various nights.  usually reasonable cover charge for bands which is nice in this economy. The usual bar games, i want to say they are free during certain times . . . not sure on that tho'.Decent selection, you will pretty much find all of the brands you are looking for. It's pretty expensive overall. Maybe that's just groceries in general, but I spend a lot of money on food, I guess. The liquor and beer department is pretty large and they have good deals on alcohol most of the time. It gets busy during dinner time. Usually their cashiers can handle it. There is a Wells Fargo bank and Starbucks inside of the grocery store, which is a big perk for me. They also have Coinstar and movie rentals, I think a Blockbuster box.Yeah, it's got a lot of the obnoxious ASU crowd. But so does every other bar in Tempe, and at least there's not half-naked 18-year-olds dancing on tables here. When I come here with friends I avoid big game nights and usually hunker down at one of the tables in the sunken area near the front door - I find that usually shelters us from general bar idiocy, which is nice. They have pool, air hockey, and.... ping pong (which is TOTALLY irritating to pool players, I'm sure... but I don't really care).

I agree that the womens' bathroom is terrible (maybe they should put some AA info in the stalls for the girls who end up puking their guts out in there at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday night...) but I also agree that the food is surprisingly good, I had a pretty bitchin chicken philly here.Doc and Eddy's is okay. Nothing special, nothing great. Might be a decent place to meet with a larger group of people for some bar food and drinks. The place is huge. You won't feel cramped going here.

Towards the back, there are many pool tables and various games to play. There are more tables toward the front to eat. You can't go far without a TV in sight.

I had the SoCal Chicken Sandwich on a recent visit. The sandwich was okay, a bit dry. I did like the seasoning on my fries though. I think the food is decent for a bar. I was actually full from the food when I left. That doesn't happen often. 

Service was okay. The service was just enough to keep you satisfied, but not great that you felt you needed to tip extremely well. My previous experience the service was well below average. 

My draft beer was pretty flat with no foam. I'm glad it wasn't half foam, but maybe a bit? For a place that serves draft beer, this is BAD!

I can see myself going here from time to time, but mainly because it would be a few minute walk.There were ample pool tables which was nice but the sitting tables were seriously garbage. The seating was horrible and I felt like I was gonna fall every second. Also they were unnecessarily close to eachother. 

The prices were alright for bar food. Nothing too special on pitchers of beer. 

The food was SO good. Like, I was really surprised. Usually bar food is only tolerable. (even at some of my favorite sports bars)  But everything we ordered was extraordinary. It was restaurant quality and worth the price.

As for the atmosphere, it'll keep me from going here again. Absolutely FULL to the brim with college pukes. If you don't know what a college puke is, I suggest you walk around Mill Ave from 6pm-11pm. You'll soon find out. Not my thing, but some people might love it. (college pukes)Good food, but $11.50 for a salad and a drink?  I ended up only getting water..  Should have got $2.50 back..  Still..

Everything was good and seemed fresh.  Tried 2 soups, both of the current vegetarian ones.  I enjoyed them.  I guess the concept of the buffet is that people will come in and make 12 trips and eat everything..  

If you only want 1 salad trip, a cup of soup, and a drink, go elsewhere.  Not worth the price at all.

That said, I knew all of that going in, and went anyways..  So I give myself 2 stars for going in and having the nerve to complain.  I did make a hella good salad, so I feel my 2 stars are well deserved.My company rented the place out for a little team building politcal bs awards...thing. ANYWAY, the bowling was actually really fun! Staff was very helpful as we "dumbies" tried to enter our names into a screen, they also put up bumpers (yeah, you heard me) and got those metal ramp things for the little tiny kids to roll their balls down. Everyone had a good time.By, oh....11 am we were in desperate need of energy drinks. They only had Amp behind the bar and they were 5 frickin' bucks but we were deperate. Although it was a corporate business event, it was apparent they hadn't pre-selected any music for the video screen-but that said, they had a really cool video screen! I did hear some ACDC but I heard way more of Pitbull, Lil Wayne, Ray Ray and some other randoms that I don't know. "I put ON fo my city-ON ON fo my city!" Way too much Michael Jackson in my opinion but whatever. It was cool that you could request songs. I don't know if this is all the time though. The "EXTREME" bowling was fun with the lights and glow-in-the dark neon. I felt like I was in a club-ony with a bunch of other losers that were bowling! Fun place. I won free games so I guess I am going back!Used to go to Boston Market a long time ago.  Loved the chicken and the cole slaw, so went in just for that.  Guess what?  They don't make cole slaw anymore.  So I won't be a customer anymore.  Just ok.Dry cleaned items came out great, but my laundered shirts were very wrinkled. 

Cheap though for 6 items I paid 18 bucks.i've never heard of this place, but i received a brief history from one of my friends on this establishment. Gold Bar was located where Xtreme Bean now stands on the (south west corner of McClintok and Southern) a long time ago. I guess Xtreme Bean bought them out of their location or they just took over... that's why they moved to the location there at now (North East corner of Southern and McClintok) 

i thought this place is really neat, they have comfy seats and outside-furniture inside with cushions for your bum. It's a smaller place which to me is a lot better especially when you're trying to get things done, no distraction like loud people or a piano playing. 

the only thing i didn't like about this place was the price of their latté it was the same price as starbucks or some other place and it didn't even taste that good. i was disappointed on that fact. Maybe i just ordered a bad drink so i'm going to go back and give them another try....Hogi Yogi seemed so perfect to me in Theory...how disappointed I was in the end. So my boyfriend says he wants me to try this place because they have sandwiches, salads, teriyaki bowls, and best of all FROZEN YOGURT.  One of my favorite things in this world in case you couldn't tell. 

So maybe I had to high expectations, but I was expecting Hogi Yogi to be like a cafe. Not so it was built like a cheap fast food joint minus the drive through. Atmosphere is very important to me...why I don't know. I ordered the sandwich combo which was a really great deal. For about six dollars I got a hearty six inch sub, drink, and chips. The frozen yogurt though, which was definitely my soul motive, did not make me happy. My boyfriend and I decided to split a large, super huge for 
$ 4.50, Raspberry Sherbet blended yogurt. Maybe the Sherbet blend was a mistake and we should have stuck to chocolate or vanilla. It did not taste like rasberrys and it didn't taste like yogurt either!  I'm just going to hope they haven't mastered their Sherbet Yogurt Blends and they still have good frozen yogurt! Sandwiches alone aren't worthy enough to keep me coming back.Feeling a bit sluggish one night during vacation, Lisa H and I decided to order from a local pizza joint.  After searching Yelp reviews of places near our hotel, Venezia's seemed to be the place to check out.

Venezia's online menu was nice and comprehensive.  A lot of the pizzas looked really tempting, but we opted for the simple, large one topping pizza (pepperoni), so we could take advantage of the Yelper discount that was available.  We also got an order of the family-size breadsticks.

Venezia gets big points for having an online ordering form!  Nicely done!

But they lose a few points for taking over an hour to deliver to just a few miles away.  Yes, yes, I realize they're probably consistently hoppin', but 60 minutes to get my foodstuffs was a little longer than I'd normally be willing to wait for pizza.

That being said, the pizza and breadsticks did arrive warm, despite the long wait.  Everything was really tasty, definitely some good pizza here!  I was a big fan of the crust.  Just thick enough not to be obnoxious.  And obviously still foldable to be considered NY style, right?  The breadsticks were also quite delicious.  But for two people, the amount that we ordered ended up being way too much!  I guess that's better than not enough.

Overall, if I lived in the area, I'd probably be back to check out more of Venezia's menu.  Good eats at a decent price, for sure.Pizza was pretty good. The wings were undercooked, and uneatable.Ordered 2 dozen wings online on the way out of work...

Hit the front door at exactly 25 minutes, the estimated time the order would be ready.

Wings were hot and the seasoning, while I would prefer hotter, came in as a 100% buffalo wing sauce with appropriate heat.

The order was  respectably heavy for the number of wings ordered...the price for 2 dozen wings at $20 is a bit more than I am used to spending.

The snips of celery and carrot are barely recognized...c'mon, folks...the veggies are cheap.  As for the dressing, 2 ounces...really?

You are the closest location to home.  You are not, however, the least expensive of my options within a reasonable (1.5 mile) radius.went with a group of about 20 ladies on a wednesday evening about 6:30pm. The owner/waiter was very helpful and humorous.  Each entree comes with soup or salad, choices of soup were lentil or tomato.  I had the tomato and thought it was delicious! Only one lady in the group mentioned she thought it was a little salty.  The lentil was also good according to the ladies that had it.  I ordered middle eastern tea, which was lovely.  Just the right amount of sweet and it had very pleasant taste.  My entree was vegetable mousakka, which came with rice pilav.  The pilav was good but I thought the mousakka was very greasy and I could only finish half and I skipped dessert.Our family ate here a lot when we lived in AZ.  Last night I was in town and my folks wanted to go.  It has not changed a bit!  

Outstanding salsa (you have to ask for the "hot" if you want it).  Great thin chips.  Prices seem to have gone up which is disappointing but you get plenty of food.

Nothing great to look at, not the best Mexican food in AZ, but good solid stuff.I went here yesterday for lunch with some friends. The food was pretty good, but the service was a bit lackluster. when we went in it was early afternoon and the place was pretty dead.  I had a margarita pizza, which was pretty tasty... very garlicky. The service was really slow, especially towards the end of the meal. Someone had asked for a box and had to ask 4 times before she got one. So that was not so good. We also had to wait about 20 minutes for someone to come by so we could ask for our check to be split. I would probably come back here, but maybe just for pizza to go.We loved our pizza but we couldn't put our finger on what tasted off about the Caesar Salad.  At first we thought it was maybe too much lemon but after tasting the dressing alone we found it contained overpowering amounts of mustard.  But otherwise we're fans.Wings! You can get them any way ya like and order more on wing Tuesday!!  I like the honey bbq and the pinapple teriyaki.  YUMMY.  Some co workers and I hit this place last Tuesday.  We had 5 in our party and we were seated right away.  Service was good, drinks were refilled, and the bill was brought promptly.  Thats great during lunch hour because time is of the essence to get back to work.  The interior could use a little sprucing up at this site but it's fine for lunch or a quick bite.  Probably a hopping place during football season too.I've been a native customer for some time, mostly in Maricopa which, btw, has a great staff that almost always does a good job of attending to your wants. The wait staff at this location unfortunately does not do the same, mostly young looking kids who pretty much don't know squat about multi-tasking and being attentive to the customer. If you are going to sit outside in the patio area you should probably try to sit right at the bar where you can get your drinks sooner and not have to wait like 15 minutes for someone to come and take your order. As far as food goes, the wings are always awesome, my favorites being honey hot and asiago parmesan and the strippers, which are chicken strips sold by the half or full pound. Sandwiches are pretty good, but the pizza reminds me too much of food chain pizza, which of course it is. Overall though, its a pretty good place to have a bite and sip a few drinks.We went here somewhat often because we lived in the neighborhood. The food is alright. It's never too busy and the service is fast. Pretty cheap. Regular margaritas are small, so get the large.Went not expecting much as I have been to Arby's numerous times.  I went through the drive thru this time where I was greeted kindly, but the service was pretty slow.  The food was exactly what I expected, and my appetite was satisfied.  Recommend if you're looking for something other than your typical burger and fries.This nice mid-sized place has patio dining available during the cooler months, and a full bar.  It's comfortable inside, & the food is ok, but to me there was nothing exciting about the place.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was delicious, but the lentil soup & yogurt salad dressing were not as good as at Indian Delhi Palace, & I had more fun at Delhi Palace Cuisine of India.  With the price a little high at $9.99 for lunch, & both of these alternatives nearby, I can only give Royal Taj 3-Stars.Like most of the reviews have already stated... no one else was in the restaurant. I don't understand how they stay in business, and I assumed the restaurant portion of the building was merely a front. 

I did not enjoy the atmosphere of this place, at all. A nice woman took our order, then went to the kitchen to make it, I assume. The food was decent, actually pretty tasty. I ordered the vegetable platter, it was about 15 dollars which was twice as much as what my friend got, for half as much food. I didn't care, I thought it was pretty delicious. 

I don't think I will go back because I'm fairly sure I can find a decent indian food place with a slightly better vibe.I love REI, non rei products and services.  I buy 90% of my gear there.  The reasoning for the 3 stars is the following:  1.  REI brand gear is terrible and have had nothing but problems.  2.  I recently decided to try their 100% satisfaction guarantee policy on a backpack that has given me a lot of issues.  The employee gave me a guilt trip about how much they lose when I return, interogated me on my issues with the backpack....that said, very knowledgable staff and everything need for outdoor gear.Good spot, but can be a little hit or miss. The patrons are always a different type of people depending on the day or even time of day. It's a shot and a beer, keep 'yer head down kinda spot.Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.

Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.

I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!

Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.I am donning my flame suit now...

I did not enjoy Ted's. I did not enjoy my hot dog. I did not enjoy my trip there that much. I got a footlong because I was that hungry. I ate about a 1/4 of it...and am still slightly hungry. The bun was too crusty, they drowned it in ketchup so much that the bun was breaking at the bottom where it joined.

...That and some of the customers were just...RUDE. I got shoved out of the way by granny with a terrible bun on the top of her head. I had to curb my initial reaction of pulling out my scissors to cut it. I CUT YOU!  We were also getting the stink eye from someone who had ZERO rights to be giving us that kind of glare with her robin's egg blue eyeshadow. She was so 70s that she's just barely back in style...and failed in her attempt at putting on her black cake eyeliner like Cleopatra. I guess these people were hungry or something...but no need to knock me over and shove my husband in your bid to get the hot dawg in yer tummy!

Rudeness and oddball people aside, I found the actual workers extremely friendly and courteous -- that made the whole experience a lot more redeeming. I loooved their fries. Best damn fries I've ever had. They made up for that mess of a hot dog. Hubby had the onion rings. OH.MY.GOD. Best goddamn motherf****ing onions rings e v a r -- E V A R  --- EVARRR!!1!!!!

The smell alone of the place made my mouth water, but the hot dog made me so sad. Maybe I'll try it again, but I'll make sure to go when the freaks aren't out..

For now, Ted's gets 3 stars. I'd have given them 2, but they serve Pepsi (woot!!!) and their fries and onion rings gave me happy tummy, even if their hot dogs fell short of what I was expecting...As most customers have said, the prices here are and the service is speedy.  My clothes have always been ready on time.  The staff is very friendly, and most of their work is very high quality.

My only complaint is that for the past two times I've had my shirts done here, the buttons on the upper sleeves have come back to me either shattered, broken or completely missing.  Another shirt has come back to me with a frayed cuff.  I don't know if it is the methodology or just not enough care taken.  So while I appreciate the prompt, speedy service, decent prices and affordable prices.  I will not be using them again.The view here is better than the food. The food was okay, but definitely way tooooo expensive for its quality.

I had the belly pork which was good just SO small. My boyfriend had a chicken dish which was good but not anything special. 

Our waitress was okay, but I didn't think service was exceptional either.

If you go here, go for the view and atmosphere!I've been here 5-6 times. Always impressed in the past but not this time.  Service was quick and good. Menu has changed from the French-American fare I've loved to a local, add ingredients by how exotic they sound menu now.  View was okay except for the reflection of the football game from the bar in every window. 
Nice place, they need to return to their rootsOne thing is clear, these people don't know how to run a restaurant. We made a reservation for 9 on a Thursday evening and were surprised to find that we didn't need a reservation at all, the place was empty. Even thought we were nearly the only ones there, dinner, for which we only had one course, took 3 hours. The waitstaff, while not overtly rude, were unattentive and unapologetically uninformed about the menu. 

The bright side: the food was great. We ordered a variety of entrees and everyone was very pleased with the quality and presentation of the food. 

Three stars is honestly generous for this experience. But at least we all left full and satisfied.Nice but older Marriott property that was well kept. I love the fact that it was built into the rocks. 

My work had a conference here and the place was very accommodating. Great breakfast, nice bars (though pricey), and decent facilities for the event.  Pool was quite extensive as well as the property...meaning you had to walk a bit at times to get anywhere!

My room was clean, well kept, quite, and spacious. Just what I like.I am normally a Marriott fan, so I was beyond disappointed with the fact that this is a smoking property.  Smoking at the pool bar and grill, and smoking at the pool and hot tubs.  It seems other Marriott properties provide smoking areas for the smokers leaving non-smokers to enjoy the bulk of the property.  My son and I were trying to enjoy our meal at the pool bar and grill and there were at least 3 men there smoking cigars!!!  What gives, Marriott?  Needless to say, I will be staying elsewhere the next time I visit the area!This small little eatery serves up huge breakfast burritos that are easy on your wallet. We shared a steak and eggs burrito (~$4) and a machaca and eggs burrito (~$3.50). The steak and egg burrito had a generous portion of meat and egg, with flavorful, thinly cut steak. I liked that the machaca had veggies in it such as tomato and onion, but I couldn't taste much of the machaca in the burrito, and the flavor of the other ingredients tended to drown out the beef.

They also have your standard fare such as enchiladas, various burritos, tacos, as well as menudo. 

We also tried some horchata ($1.70 for large size). It was cool and refreshing.

Condiments are basic, and they have a tub of individually packaged green and red sauce for you to go with your meal.

Overall, the breakfast burritos were good, but my favorite choice for a breakfast burrito is still at Los Favoritos.Bearded manager was kind of gruffy and staid, but I came in here for a cheap basketball and found one for $3.99. They had basketballs starting at 8 bucks and higher also. Mission accomplished I guess.Walmart is like warm beer - you love to hate it!

Crowds are insane. Check out lines will age you. There never anyone to answer your questions. And even if you do find anyone chances to get anything beyond blank stares are slim-to-none. Its dirty. Stupidly design. 

BUT.....

Selection is pretty damn good (Granted you find crap on your own.) Prices will outdo any other store for compatible quality stuff. You CAN walk in there naked and walk away fully dressed riding a lawn more with TV at the back, waving a rug in one hand and a tennis rocket in the other.

Pretty much if you need cheap shit for cheap prices, have a bit of time and good nerves then Wal-Mart is for YOU! 

"Its alright"

EugeneIt's Walmart and they are all the same: extremely painful places to go into.  You go in there to get something cheap that you are willing to put up with the crap to get it at that price for.  I go there for dog food.  The brand I buy is FAR cheaper there than ANYWHERE else.  
But I have some doozy stories that would be hard to top by anyone writing reviews on here at this, particular WalMart.  
Here's one of them:
Well, I don't spend much time there anymore, figure out what I need before I go in, get it and get OUT of there before - something happens.  So it was on this day that I am referring to.  I went to the Garden center to pay - I had parked back there on purpose to avoid the ridiculousness that they call cashiers, lines and whatever else going on up there at the front of the store (I have numerous stories about management and "gelling" with them up there as well).
Well, the Garden center exit was opened, meaning that there should have been someone at the register.  There wasn't a single employee to be seen, anywhere.  
I stood there for fully 5 minutes before I whipped out my phone and called Walmart.  Yes, I called THAT Walmart from inside the store.  I asked the person that answered if they could send someone over to the Garden Center to run the register. At first I was the only one waiting, after a while, there were several people waiting.  Well, no-one showed up. I called again, this time asking for the store's manager.  They put me on hold.  I have been at this Garden center checkout for well over 10 minutes now, waiting for the phantom cashier to show up and now, waiting on hold. I was on hold for several minutes.  No-one got back on the phone to tell me they were trying to get the manager on the phone, they were, apparently, just leaving me on hold and that would be the end of that.

As fortune would have it, the store's general manager and a bunch of suits came walking up to a department just on the inside of the store, not 50 feet away from me.  The suits I assumed were corporate people.  I didn't know and I never asked, but they definitely weren't shopping there, lol.  I walked up to the manager and asked her if she was ever going to answer the phone?  She had no clue what I was talking about.  I informed her that I was on hold, right then and there, for HER to answer the phone.  This was obviously embarrassing for her, but, I had waited and waited, enough was enough.  

I explained to her the situation.  All of it.  We all walked back to the Garden center registers and lo and behold, a cashier had magically appeared.  The manager, however, stopped her in the middle of what she was doing with a customer and brought her near where "we", the suits and I, were standing there, watching all of this.  She asked the cashier if she has "abandoned her post"?  Why yes, was the curt reply, someone had dropped a glass something-or-other and she had to go clean it up.  Great, said the manager, but why did you leave the register unattended?  Because, the reply came, of the mess on the floor.  That cashier was rebuked, right in front of all of us.  

I will say that that was a pretty poor decision on the manager's part.  No matter how bad an employee messes up, you don't go giving out stern rebukes in front of customers, at least that's my opinion of it.  But, I said nothing, just listened to it.  

The manager got done with her and came back to me.  Go ahead, you can go now.  ??? I had a basket full of stuff.  About $75 worth.  I was confused.  I hadn't paid for anything.  I informed her that I hadn't paid for any of the stuff in my cart.  She said, yes, I know, you are free to leave now.  I mean, Walmart has all kinds of security, they have full time security and they have cameras EVERYWHERE.  I wasn't ABOUT to walk out of there without extreme certainty that she was giving me permission to leave without even taking inventory of the items that I had in there. 

She replied yes, that is all yours, sorry for the inconvenience.  I thanked her profusely for the free items, you don't get THAT everyday, anywhere!  I walked out of there with all that unbagged, unchecked stuff without a receipt and kept looking behind me.  Is this some kind of nightmarish joke? Are they actually going to pay me back for making trouble about it by sending security after me?  I continued to keep eyes on the back of my head all the way to my car and even as I was driving out of the driveway!!

I gave it 3 stars because usually, if you are willing to contact management, the ending is okay.  Getting $75 worth of product for free was definitely a good ending!Should be 2 1/2 stars ** 1/2*

There is really love/hate relationship i have with those guys. 

They fixed my flat for free - "Just comeback to buy tires from us." they say. And i did. Of course they tried overcharge me hehehe but i brought Tire Rack print out with me and they matched it.  Though they totally messed up balancing of those tires they fixed it for free 2 weeks later, no questions asked. 
Than i came back to get one of my tires replaced on my other car and they did overcharged me A LOT as i did not bother looking up any competitors info. And i mean A LOT, maybe close to 80%. NOT cool at all. Especially, when they look you in the eye and say - we guarantee this is cheapest price. 

I will come back, but sure as hell i am bringing competitors pricing with me for them to match it. And only reason i would comeback as they are real close to me or would not. I really REALLY hate to be lied to.

"I confused"

EugeneI haven't eaten at a Baja Fresh in probably 3 years. My coworker so graciously sprang for lunch the other day, in celebration of my engagement, yay! 

Their food is always consistent and yummy! I had the grilled veggie burrito, same thing I used to get back in the day. Very tasty! She got the Grilled Shrimp Salad, she was very excited about it so I am going to assume it was awesome! There was a huge line but they got threw everyone quickly and my food didn't take to long. 

It is a big of a drive from the office but I think it might be worth adding it to the lunch time rotation!There's a little something for everyone at this South Tempe dance club. Even my Mom likes to come here! Graham, as the regulars call it, features four rooms -- the South Beach room where a DJ spins hip-hop and techno music along with the country-heavy Rockin' Rodeo room, the retro Confetti's where a DJ spins '80s and '90s hits and Alley Cats, a karaoke bar. It tends to draw an older crowd and you'll see a lot of cowboys. But the beer is certainly cheap! There are drink specials galore every night.Read about Graham's awhile ago when I was looking for a club with an 80's night. Found this place and have been here a few times since. Three stars for a few reasons. The dress code can be pretty lousy. I understand hats and baggy clothes but sleeveless shirts? Also, the 80's room doesn't play enough actual 80's music, mostly a mix with lots of 90's stuff. Lastly, the bartenders can be hit or miss; don't come here and expect to get a scotch on the rocks or an old fashioned. That being said, this place is still awesome because there are three themed areas, drinks aren't to pricey and the crowd is always fun and unusual. Don't miss out on the shots from the test tubes; they'll do the trick.Not what I expected.  Food good.  Service lousy.  Waitress too busy gossiping with customers.  Manager had to bring food to US.Lots of pool tables, friendly waitresses, good long islands and they have Guiness on tap. The crowd isn't always the best because of it's location but as long as you are there with a couple of friends it doesn't really matter.I totally suck at pool; however, when my friend comes into town when he's on leave from the Army, I'll meet him here for drinks. 

For those that are saying this place is in a sketch area: Please, really?! I've seen worse in parts of Scottsdale. 

Never have had any of their bar food offerings, but that's usually because we'll go somewhere nicer for dinner prior. 

Edit 4/15: Best fried pickles EVER. They're even spicy, woohoo! 

Awesome drink specials. He introduced me to one of their "bubble gum" vodka drinks - not a big frou frou drink kind of gal, but wowee that hits the spot! 

Fun atmosphere. The hourly pool rates are pretty reasonable according to him - I have nothing to compare it to. 

Check out Skip & Jan's if you're in the neighborhood.I love a good bagel and cream cheese, especially on a Saturday Morning.  Mind you, I have been here several times before, so its not my first time.

The benefits of Einsteins is that they make all their tasty bagels in site. Flavors are tasty, with Asiago cheese, onion, garlic, and a few other flavors as well.  Great selection of different flavors of bagels.  They also have a few different options in cream cheese flavors as well.

They also have a great selection of lunch sandwiches, which I like.  Great selection pastries, juices, etc.

Where they loose points with me, is I don't care for the service here.  I always always always have to stand in line and wait; not only to place my order, but to pay and recieve my food as well.  Some could argue that maybe I am being fussy.  Others could say that I need to be more patient at times.  I do not argue that point. BUT, nothing irks me more then waiting...and waiting....and more waiting.

I have never NOT had to step in line here, regardless of time of day.  Why is that? I don't understand.

Also, I feel that service here lacks.  I always see multiple staff members behind the counter.  If thats the case, why is it always the same 1 person taking orders, and one working the register?  I also sense that maybe other customers get frustrated with this experience as well.  I go here becuase they do have great bagels, and their stuff is tasty...but at the cost of waiting....and iffy service.

Plus, sometimes this place is NOT super clean.  Its not filthy or anything..but I just feel like maybe it could use a good cleaning at times.I only bought strings but the guy gave me a discount because of the quantity. Wasn't expecting that. But the checkout "line" is a complete cluster effGood location. Clean, well kept, and good prices. But I almost never get in and out of here quickly because of the registers. Even during busy hours, there's always only one lane open until the line gets over 5 customers deep. Only then does someone open up another register.  There is no self check out so It's a major pain if you're only there for one or two items and have to wait ten to fifteen minutes at the checkout line unless you're lucky enough to be the only one in line, which rarely happens unless it's after 10pm. There's plenty of reps out on the floor so there's really no reason for the registers to be like this. And if there is a shortage in cashiers, hire/train some!

The real reason this review is getting three stars instead of two is because of the meat department. Have gone to multiple fry's locations and if I ask one of the meat department employees for a custom cut there they are either annoyed, reluctant, or rude. I have NEVER had that experience here.The Meat department staff is always willing and happy to help and even tell me how long the cut can take so I can continue shopping and come back instead of hanging around.

If I see improvement on the register side I will definitely update my review.I do not think they deserve 2 stars, i am giving them 3!

We went there Friday night. Place was dead, no one but us. But we used to it, its all good. Got seated promptly. Soon enough some Indian lady wearing sari came and patiently explained about drinks and such. We got a big bottle of some Indian i never had before. (Blue something.) 
Food time now. We had no idea whats what, as not all the dishes were explained. So, same lady explained all the stuff to us again. Soon after all the food followed. It was NOT the best Indian food, but it was not terrible. 
I do not think they deserve only 2 stars. It was not bad, all in all. However, with that said - i will probably not come back there again as Star of India is surely better.

EugeneGetting Better, but with Warner gone...i fear a real inconsistent couple of years coming up. Good Luck in 2010 CardsUninteresting. Not any different from Danny's or IHOP or similar. Tasted alright, was warm, relatively fast service. I do not know, what else would be there? I kind of was expecting something better then Danny's but was not really disappointed when it was not. It's alright, just do not expect anything special.

"Its alright"

EugeneWell, if there are no other restaurants  open in S. Tempe, then yes I will return. This restaurant is within walking distance, so I was really, really hopeful.We came on a Monday and it was vacant in the dining room. One other couple  was just leaving. There were a few folks at the bar and they looked like they were having a good time. I thought about coming back for a drink as we were being seated. I'm still thinking about it but I won't be eating. 


We started with the fried calamari - it was okay and oddly on the dry side for a fried item, I'd almost guess it was frozen and had been microwaved. We  both ordered the specials and they were awful. The pasta with tomato cream sauce and the chicken and sauteed vegetables.  Both were scalding hot to the taste, lackluster, bland and really, really salty. I got the impression the dishes had been frozen and microwaved on blast. It caused the sauce to actually bubble on my plate. The bread that was brought was good and my side salad was tasty. The dipping sauce for the bread was a little odd- grated Parmesan and olive oil. Makes for a gluey dip. 

The service was impeccable. Due to above mentioned saltiness, I powered through 3 glasses of water and the waiter was right there with the pitcher. So, excellent service, hence the 3 stars and the hope that they might have a decent bar. I'm a sucker for a good bar, so I'll be back and report my findings. Wish me luck .boston's. dirty, dirty, dirty boston's. 

the beer is flat, the decor is deteriorating before your eyes (literally saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.), and the offtrack betting is amazing and makes you feel even dirtier!

but this is a dive bar and you should have no standards when you walk in here. if you have standards all the time you should probably go hit up some glitzy, clean chain bar that serves those drinks with little umbrellas in them. this is dirty boston's.

they serve minipitchers during happy hour for around 3.50 depending on if you like domestic or you want to get fancy with an imported beer. service has always been friendly and actually pretty prompt. bathrooms are scary, but c'mon, didn't i tell you this was a dive bar? don't go looking for ambience, just come here if you'd like to get really drunk really fast. priorities.Another "do-it-yourself" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .1 star for being 2 blocks away from work
1 star for serving super cheap, super large beers
1 star for being kicked out from an Applebee's -YES, AN APPLEBEE'S- after 5 super cheap, super large beersI like Staples. I think they are one of the better office supply stores. I loved that this location was literally right around the corner from work. If we ever ran out of something I could be there and back within 5 minutes.

But now this location is closing this week on June 21. So booooo. It really sucks. Now I will have to order everything on-line or drive 6 miles to the next closest location. I still like Staples but dislike that this location is closing. So that is why it gets 3 stars.

Bye Staples. I at least will miss you.Meeting my friends there for lunch.  The first waiter screwed up my drink.  I asked for an icea tea, I got a diet soda.  The first waiter came by to tell me that he is leave this area, and someone else is going to be our waiter.  OK.  I told the second waiter that I ordered an ice tea.  He got me a new drink ASAP.  NICE!  

We ordered:  Fish & Chip and Crispy Chicken Burger.  The food was good but not jumping out of my seat good.  The steak fries are always bottomless, so it was good.BW3 used to stand for Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck.  What happened to Weck?  Was he fired?  Can they legitimately still call themselves BW3 if they are really BW2?  Is that misleading?  Are they Buffalo Wings and Water now?  That won't work because only Beer washes down chicken wings properly.  Then they would be BW2&B.  That's just awkward.

Anyway, I had the jerk chicken sandwich.  They actually pulled it off better than I expected.  The spice rub had plenty of pleasant hottness and it was seared and slightly blackened.  The wings were pretty tasty (I grabbed one of my wife's) but not as good as the ones I make at home.

Service was good and the atmosphere was an interesting and almost fun mix of sports bar and family restaurant.  We happened to hit on Guitar Hero night so the kids liked that.  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?  Who doesn't want to hear Orange Crush 7 times in a row?Good Service, consistent "Denny's Style" food prep and what appears to be a well managed franchise store. the wait persons were very attentive and happy. The whole experience was a pleasure.

Nothing much more to say...I got plastic covers for pages that go in a binder. They had them. The kind mid 20s, female employee lead  me to them. They had other office related items there as well. I used their bathroom. Don't worry, I got it all in the urinal...except the second half, but that's to be expected. I spoke to the cashier. He was probably about 55 years old. Apparently he "lost it all" in the stock market. Odd thing to share as I'm checking out. Whatever. Have a cool day bub.They are ok... Just go there they got wifi Internet and its all good to catch up with my work and school online while there during my vacation in ArizonaI want to give this place 2.5 stars until I can try something different. Went to lunch there on a weekday. Apparently we were the first one there. I guess whoever orders first for the day gets the call on the special of the day. So for those of you that went Wednesday, sorry it's taco. Looking at the prices on the menu, this place is definitely overpriced for your standard Mexican fare. The average food (not ala carte) is about $10-12. Taco was a hardshell taco. I asked for shredded beef. Taco shell is not home made. Your standard taco bell taco shell. I really really despise that. I want fresh deep fried authentic taco shells! Otherwise I can go and buy some Ortega taco kits! The shredded beef however was moist, flavorful and good. It wasn't totally dried up and flavorless as someone claimed. So basically the taco shell sucked, otherwise it was alright.I've been to the Subway on Gilbert Road several times now for breakfast.  The service is good and the people behind the counter are very attentive but their toasting oven is a little tired.  If you order the breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese on flatbread you need to ask them to toast it twice because if you don't, you'll probably get egg that is cold in the middle .. yuke! .. the good news is that if you make that request they don't hesitate and they do it for you .. they really need a new toaster over in my opinion.Decent sports grill.  There is always a crowd so you know the place must be popular with the locals.  The place does tend to get a bit loud as it starts to fill up.  Be prepared to talk over everyone else.

I have been here a handful of times.  The food is good... with the exception of my most recent time (1/4/2013) I went.  You can't go wrong with the wings.  As a wing connoisseur, these are pretty good.  Also, based on reading others reviews here on Yelp, you definitely can't go wrong with the Pretzel Sticks as an appetizer.  You get 7 sticks with a side of cheese sauce.  It could be a meal in and of itself.  

I also did have the bacon double cheeseburger lavosh  my past visit on 1/4/2013.  Although it did not taste that bad going down, there was something with it that did not agree with my innards.  Let's just say that the leftovers I did have immediately went into the trash.  I'm hoping that this was just one dish and not a trend of things to come.

No bashing on Teakwoods though.  I will go back on occasion and try other things on the menu.  I am hoping the one bad dish does not outweigh the other good ones that I have had.  And as a tip, if you go for the fish & chips, make sure you get there early.  The last time I went and tried to order it at 7pm on a Friday night, there were none left.I bought my Conceal and Cary gun from these guys.  I called looking for a specific firearm and they had it $20 cheaper than Cabalas.  

The store is really hard to find and in what looks like a rough area of town.  

The first time I visited the store I felt out of place and a little not wanted.  The staff didn't seem to be interested in helping me out and even scolded me for releasing the slide on a gun so that it slammed shut. What ever man.  

The next time that I came in the owner was there and helped me find the gun that I was looking for.  He gave me some tips on a good CCW course and even threw in some Bullets for a discount. wink wink...

The owner was awesome and made my experience great.  I don't think that I'll drive out there again though...By far not my favorite place, but others seem to love it.  Stopped here for dinner last night.  Chips and salsa are average, prices are high.  Best thing to me on the menu is the carne asada, but it costs about $17 for the meal so I don't get it often.  Had the combo #2 and have to say I liked it.  The beef taco was good, and the ground beef enchilada wasn't too bad either.  Think the plate was about $10, and came with a side of rice, but no beans.   They have made some changes to the decor since I was last there, but still think that the food is average at best.  I will say that even as busy as they were, food came out pretty fast which is great when you have hungry kids.  FYI - parking sucks.I'm not on this side of town very often but I was craving a pizza and very happy to see something other domino's or pizza hut or papa john's. I really am a big fan of Hungry Howies.

Just can't put my finger on what it was about this location. The pizza was okay (pepperoni with garlic crust). And they really seem to know their regulars. All in all, the pie did what I needed it to do. I'll be back I'm sure.I can't say much about this bar since I had only been here for a couple of times. It was recommended by a friend of mine and I went there one night. Drinks were great though.I usually go through the drive-thru here... and after walking inside, you'd probably be better off going through the drive-thru as well. 

It's really old and dated inside and they have a really large dining area. I found out that they sell ice cream cakes here which is kind of cool. They've got some in a freezer that you can just pick up inside and there was also a sign that said you could special order ice cream cakes as well...good to know.

I don't go here often, and I'm not super huge on their food - but it's quite nice to treat yourself to some ice cream once in awhile!It's a subway. Same ol' stuffJust opposite to Thunderbird business school...Food is OK .. The service is very poor.. Infact one of the person is very rudeThis was the first Carl's Jr I ever ate at.  The Realtor showing me rental houses back in '93 took me here for lunch.  The lunch was fine.  The only property he showed me that would accept pets I filled out the paperwork for only to find out cats are not pets according to that owner.  I also forgot my hat as we left.  Even though I drive by it several times a week I seldom stop as it doesn't fit my schedule.

This morning I had their breakfast burger, which I have had before, and with beef, bacon, egg, hashbrowns and stuff it really is a breakfast on a bun.  Even at 6AM on a Saturday they were doing a steady stream of business at the drive through but only one other customer at the walk up counter.  I am sure this location has been remodeled since my first visit over 16 years ago.  It is in very god condition.Hmmm I have not had the displeasure of dance night at the Chilly, I guess. I came here to meet some friends I haven't seen in a while and ended up having quite a good time on poker night. 

It was crowded but I never had a hard time getting a drink. Mostly regulars, I would guess, and I thought everyone was pretty cool that I played with. 

Can't complain, but can't rave, either...Located at SE corner of 59th ave. & Union Hills, this small location always seems to have polite and prompt service.  The only downfall is the smaller than average seating area, and given the proximity to the medical college nearby it can be hard to find a seat.  Just a few doors down is Rosatis pizza and a new Spanish tapas bar, so it's in a nice location within the strip mall.Coming from Seattle I have had my fair share of Teriyaki and by no means does Arizona have a place even decent.  However this place is A-OK status and that is a far cry from lowly Samurai Sam's that everyone here thinks is great.  

I see some really bad reviews but on this experience my chicken was moist and there was the same proportion I would get if I was in Seattle.  I admit the sauce is just decent but I spice it up with Siracha anyways.  The rice was sticky and not dried out like other places as well.  The salad was very weak so I'll skip that next time but hey guess what at least there will be a next time.  :) 

Summary:
If your from a city with great Teriyaki it's not going to be up there but if Samurai Sam's is the best you have had give this spot a try.If you're looking to drink on the cheap, it is hard to do better than Cheers.I've been to quite a few Indian buffets around the world in my lifetime.  I am being a little generous when I am giving this "palace" three stars.

The selection is quite basic: saag, tandoori chicken, a dal curry, chicken masala, and some other options which probably aren't worth mentioning.  The Naan came a bit late and a choice between butter and garlic wasn't offered.

The table settings were basic, with an attempt to be on the formal side but with napkins with shredded edges, a darkish interior, and diner-style booths.

Overall, it was decent and the price was reasonable (I want to say that it was about $8/ person), but I'd only return if I were in the mood for Indian and in the immediate area.Need tiny safety pins, googly eyes or fimo clay ? If you are a crafter, model builder or a kid of any size you might want to check out the Hobby Bench.  Model Airplane builders , train geeks and little old ladies with dolls ,have a super place to have their needs fulfilled. 

This store has a wide variety of model building supplies, craft supplies and science materials . Who knew my ten year old would actually request to go here to browse?   I was kind of shocked at how much there was and the variety. Great place to buy a birthday present that might actual make a kid use their brain. 

The store seemed strangely busy for a Sunday afternoon. I guess I was shocked because with the economy being slow and all,I thought it would be near closing..but good news the economy appears fine in Hobby Bench.  I watched  a couple of large purchases of items I was reassured that hobbyists must make sure to budget to have their creative needs fulfilled. 

Prices seemed reasonable  and clerks helpful..I came here last night with a friend for dinner and received average service.. Our waitress was very nice and prompt. +1  The margaritas were way way too sour and basically tasted like slurpees.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese Chopped Salad (in which the cheese is made from vegetable enzymes and is imported from Denmark, containing no dairy which was nice +2) and it was very filling. The side of potatoes were very good as well.  I will most likely be returning.Ok I admit it.  I didn't want to go here.  The only reason I went was because we had a $50 gift card burning a hole in my pocket.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised.  Blooming onion was good, or so I am told.  I don't eat deep fried onion.  Each of us had different entries and everyone nearly licked their plates.  Now this was after a long day of riding but still that says alot. 
I had a pork chop with vegies (instead of potatoes) and it was very good.  The wine list isn't large but I found one I liked.  The Captain's Mai Tai is delish if you throw the Captain overboard.  Skipped dessert so can't address that but everyone at the table was happy.Good dive bar, place is really big,Pleasantly surprised. Located adjacent to O'Reilly Auto Parts- Padre Murphy's offers a Sports Bar Oasis to those who find it.

We were there for the 'St. Pierre vs. Shields' fight. We were not charged a cover and were able to find a booth for our party of 6.

FYI, after the 'Live'  coverage, they do offer replays of the match AND offer $1 Sliders to go with. I had ordered the prime rib sliders and paid $9... I could have waited.

Drinks were pretty standard. They did have mojitos, which many sports bars don't seem to offer. TONS OF TVs. My BF thought the on-tap selection was pretty average but did like the mini pitchers they offered for any draft beer.

A disappointment was a server. I think she was 12 years old and had no idea what beers were on tap. Even when my BF ordered Red Rover because he saw the tap head, she said that they did not carry that beer... we had to convince her to just put the order in and see what happened. Low and behold, a mini pitcher of Red Rover came out 15 minutes later!

Food is pretty standard- no gross disappointments. My slider wasn't that great but they do have a Huge variety of sandwiches.

Only true negative is the parking. Many of the parking spots are reserved for the surrounding businesses. There were a few announcements being made throughout the game about people's cars getting towed by O'Reilly's.3.5 Padres is a North Phoenix "icon" but that does not mean I have to love each time I am there right? 

I like most of the food. The drinks are all good. The service is usually good. The live band "western bred" was really cool people. 

The rest is just ok. There was nothing that was outstanding or terrible. Just a good old bar. 

I know the ST Paddys experiance is a good time here.Family and I thought this place wasn't too bad. Daughter loved their salads. Wife also enjoyed hers. Mine must not have been that great since I can not remember what I ate!!!! It has been ten days ago since we were there. But once again I am drawing an blank. The service was decent though!Dang, I have to demote this to 2 and a half stars, rounded up to 3.  The food was a disappointment during a previous visit, but I thought it may have been just an off day for them. I went in today hoping to find the food as good as during my first visits, but unfortunately this meal was just as disappointing as the last one. There were still some good dishes - the clams in spicy broth, the shrimp dishes, the veggies, the baked yams. But the sushi - which I raved about in my previous review - was not quite fresh, the fish fillets had a batter that was still uncooked underneath the fried exterior, the fried chicken was a little tough and tasted like reheated leftovers. The rest of the  dishes remained pretty much the same as in previous visits: some good, some just OK. For now I have to take this off my list of preferred buffets.The pizza is OK, drinks are alright..the wait staff is the best part of this restaurant. The servers are funny with an edge of mean- which I personally enjoy.  The italian nachos are a really odd dish- but are delectable.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent here- I believe $4 vodka drinks and half off appetizers (italian nachos).Happy hour is very good! The waitresses were very friendly.  The reason of taking 2 stars off was that the Asian man (hope he is not owner). He asked us whether we are ready to go while we were enjoying the dinner.  He put the check without saying anything. We felt we were NOT welcomed & rushed to get out!We've been looking for a teppanyaki place in our neck of the woods but were a little leery of this place from the old "drive by" since it's in a strip mall in an older building.  This was nonsense however, because inside the place ended up being pretty interesting and delightful.  Sure, it's an older building but the place seemed really clean, the bathrooms were well kept and here's the BONUS - they got the long fountain / fish pond working and filled with fish (and turtles!).  It's quite unique - check out the pics here on yelp.

We came for teppanyaki and were seated right away and only had to wait a few minutes for the other half of the grill table to fill up.  My husband opted for sushi instead and ordered a rainbow roll.  He said it was good, not the best he'd had, but that it was pretty sizeable and filled him up.

My daughter and I had teppanyaki - she ordered shrimp and I had steak & lobster - yum!  (c'mon this was a Mother's Day celebration...)  The chef was really young but he was quite funny and obviously talented.  He was flipping rice clumps into our mouths (I caught it - yay!) lighting onion volcanoes, tossing prank eggs at us (empty shells) and making Nemo jokes - my daughter loved it!  He cooked everything really well and made the evening so special.  

They sang for about 4 birthdays while we were there, they were enthusiastic and the birthday havers seemed really ecstatic - they brought some special fruit plate type of desert thing out.

The ice tea wasn't so good but the turtles made up for that - let's hear it for turtles!Sushi is good the workers are friendly but when you come at closing they don't seem so happy who would but if you have gone the whole day with a good attitude you should end the day the same way! Food is good they also rush closing is at 11 but you have to order by the time they say.I have been here a few times with the kids bowling. And it has been a hit and miss for service. When it is good, it is just that - "good". Never really excel at being helpful and take forever with the requests.

 Examples (Bad):

- Ball stuck on lane, call the front desk who says "will be there in a min" - 5 min later no one... so I walk down the gutter and get ball myself. Employees come over and say I can't do that. Well, I was on a "timed" bowling special....and they were cutting into my time.

- Food is just ok - and again, hit and miss. Oil in fryer tastes like no changed very often... or maybe fryer isn't cleaned? As the "burnt" taste lingers. Had pizza twice.. one time was good, one time was not.

- Bathrooms are not frequently checked - when my 6yo says the bathroom is gross, we have a problem.

Place just lacks consistency - and since it is definitely not a cheap outing (Spend about $80 food, ~2 hours bowling, etc for family of 4), I would expect more.After capturing the star of Alderon
and completing my quest through the depths of the terra
I followed Spartakus through the taro,
Desperately seeking Arakana for inspiration
Looking for a sun beneath the sea.
Somehow it led to Wal-Mart, where I found a box full of yellow highlighters. Enlightenment achieved! Sweet! 
(And apologies if the reference is lost, ever since the great cataclysm nothing has ever been the same. Someday the children will lead us to light.)As far as BBQ goes, this place is pretty good.  Had to try Thee Pitts Again after driving by and seeing this place all lite up like a 60's Dinner.  When you walk in you know your in good hands after seeing all of the trophies they have won over the years.

We started with their fried cheese squares and fried pickles.  Both were very good. My friend had never had a fried pickle so it was truly a treat for him. I had a pulled pork sandwich with the slaw on top. It was very good, pork was tender and dried out.  Their fries were ok.  

My friend had their ribs which to our surprise had a lot of fat on them.  If they smoked their ribs for hours you would think there would be little fat if any left in them providing they were trimmed before cooking.  We told our server and she stated "no one ever complains about our ribs"... 

Based on their pulled pork and apps we will visit them again but we won't get ribs. Maybe try their brisket instead.Sorry for the price and portions, not a deal. I know BBQ. do some myself. I rather goto one of the chains then here.To be honest, I expected more from this place. Again, it is a Triple D eatery yet I wasn't too pleased with the food. I watched this segment on Triple D and the food looked amazing! Unfortunately, I didn't get the same quality as it looked like on TV. I ordered the pulled pork with a side of their potato salad and I wish it was better. 

The pulled pork, which already had BBQ sauce on top, was still too dry for me. The portion definitely was not a lot for the price it reflected. I feel like I paid too much for that meal. 

A few positives that I found were: Before the entree, we ordered the deep fried sampler which was really good! And the dipping sauce that accompanied it was just perfect for the dish. What was also good was their potato salad. This was probably one of the best potato salads I've had. Really well done on those two! 

The service was also nice! The lady was really kind and attentive to our table, even though there really weren't many people in the restaurant. But she still catered to us. 

The place is very diner-like which was nice. Colorful and a little different.

Overall, I grade this place a C. I wasn't too pleased with their specialized items. I could probably find a better BBQ place than this spot and I don't think I would come here again. Enjoy!We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  

We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  

Then our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  

I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  

To sum up everything, it was ok.In 1999 the AZ Republic Voted Abacus Inn Best Chinese in the Valley. That is sad because Chinese can be so much better.

 But I do have to say that Abacus Inn does something nice that I don't see too often in other Chinese Restaurants. They give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated. 

I had the Yui Shan Chicken, it was a fail because of the inedible Shiitake Mushroom stems in my dish.  Trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but, I do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes I tried from the surrounding Chinese Restaurants including Bamboo Cafe, Ginger China Bistro, and Shangri La. I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful. Unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry. Maybe a THIRD STRING cook was on the day I was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better?

The sautéed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yui Shan dish this Spicy Beef REALLY WAS VERY SPICY. I am used to a more developed and balanced Szechuan sauce so I wasn't a fan of this dish from here. But I do note this sauce was better than what you'd get from surrounding Chinese Restaurants.

The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice.

It's a toss up between Abacus Inn and Shangri la . Abacus does some more impressive stuff but Shangri la does cook moist chicken.Been closed for at this location forever ...contacted by management and they have a new place  83rd ave and Thunderbird.I hate to be the first place to not love this place, but hear me out. I have been in here a few times recently as I am new to home brewing and I am getting quickly addicted. I don't know nearly as much as I would like to on the subject, but I can't be the only newbie walking into this store. 

The first time I walked into this store I had a great experience, however this most recent visit was less then satisfying. The gentleman that was helping me seemed very knowledgable but very abrasive. Every question I asked seemed like a burden to him. I appreciate local business and I truly want to support them, but I would rather order my supplies online then deal with the trouble of feeling stupid in the store.Sure it's not as big as Dick's at the mall, but in many departments they have more going on than Dick's - better selection of therapy items for elbows, knees, etc. including ice packs and braces.  This store is just more dense and less spacious is all.  Sometimes the checkout line can be slow but otherwise it's a reliable place for your sporting needs.Kids Tennis training is expensive but good. They have 3 coaches and group the kids into one of the group based on skills. 

Bad Part : The coaching starts at 5 PM and very bad when both parents are working.Another sushi review...yes I eat a lot of sushi :)

The decor in Sakana is very nice and the Japanese waitresses are lovely. Everyone was friendly, sweet and attentive. I went because another yelp review said "The service is great the sushi is so-so."..This is 100% completely accurate. However if you are willing to overlook the not perfect sushi and want something filling, fast and inexpensive this is the place.

Went on Wed night during happy hour (740pm) ordered:
2 Tuna Roll
1 California Roll
1 Salmon Roll
2 Philly Roll
2 Drinks
Total = $20.00

Now that is a price worth going for but I do not live close enough to go back regularly. It is like a strip club..if you are in the area and want to look at attractive women it may be worth it but likely not to travel an extra 20 min when you have a local strip club across the street.Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant.They upgraded the inside very nicely (a year or so ago) and it's modern and cute.

The food is ok ...not the best. I ordered the steak and blue salad (supposed to have steak and blue cheese in it as the name suggests) they forgot the blue cheese. humm?

Their wine is not worth it.  The bread is ok but every time i've been there - it took a loooong time for it to make it to the table.

The Pasta is so/so.  The Pasta Martini is inconsistent - sometimes the sauce is too alfredo-ish and it's icky.  Can't really go wrong with the Italian Sausage Pasta and i like the Pasta Rustico (add the chicken to it! )  - but they are just typical fare. 

Sandwiches are pretty tasty.  

I'm giving it a 3start rating because it's good but never sticks out in my mind that I want to go there again.This place is hit or miss for us.  First time there was great.  Second time there absolutely sucked.  Third time there was OK.  The food is very good -actually excellent.  The problem is either shitty service, the wrong food comes out (we ordered a salad on the menu that has chicken in it...and they forgot to add the chicken???)or it's kids running amuck without anyone parent or manager taking control.  3rd time the food was great, but we got in late (9:00pm).  The restaurant was empty but the food took forever to come to us.    I would give it 4-5 stars for food, but 2-3 for crappy service, chefs and leadership.Great food but very disorganized wait staff in the front of house.....also manager doesn't know how to operate the register.....check your billWent through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich. Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems. I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough. Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe.This place is high end panda basically but id rather go to panda and that's something I wouldn't say ever but this place just isn't good. The food is okay nothing to brag about the portion is so small like very small after your done eating you'll want so much more because it just doesn't get you full and the pricing is just dumb..Love the staff. We've done two registries here and both times were fun and easy. I love this place and the quality of the products, but it's WAY too expensive for a young family. I'd say I could go to walmart, but I'd much rather go to other mothers.This used to be #1 dining option for our family but it has gotten too expensive.  Food is good, something for everyone and huge portions.  

A hang out for Sun City residents so arrive early for dinner.My boo asked me to accompany him to an ugly sweater party that his company was hosting at Rock Bottom this holiday season. They rented out the banquet room for the evening, so we loaded up the tandem and found our most heinous sweaters. 

The banquet room was quite small and could not hold all of the party guests. We ended up standing awkwardly outside of the room with other guests who were unable to fit. It was also extremely hot and stuffy. 

When my boo tried to order our drinks I got a lecture from our server about my still vertical ID. He told me to get a horizontal immediately (Ummm, who wants to wait at the DMV??) and that they normally didn't even serve customers with vertical IDs. I was a little angry about this since my ID was clearly valid no matter what direction it was. 

The drinks were pretty decent. I started out with the IPA (a little too sharp) and ended up having gin and tonics for the rest of the evening. We were pretty schwasted when it came time to bike home, and our tab wasn't too much either. And now that I have my horizontal ID, I can go back sometime.Not as good as the Rock Bottom at Shea and the 101. 

We went here for a late lunch and quick drink. I was excited to get the nachos I loved so much that I have missed since the R B at Shea ant the 101 closed down but either I remember them incorrectly or this location does not pile it on the way the Scottsdale location did....then again maybe that is why they went out of business. 

With that being said we did annihilate that nacho platter. It was big enough for two. So it is a good place, nothing to rave about but it you are looking for a Cheers-like atmosphere and in the area I say it is worth it.Service wise, this visit sucked! 

Came here around 4pm, we sat on the patio & there were still plenty of empty tables.   Our server came & took our drink order, brought our drinks & then we didn't see him again for almost 15 minutes.  He finally saw us & said he'd be right there....5 minutes later he shows up to take our dinner order.  Hubby got the 2 AM burger & I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  It took 30 minutes for our food to come out which wasn't even brought to us by our server, this other gal just kinda set it down & left. My mashed potatoes were ice cold & hard as a rock, yuck. I could tell the server wasn't coming back so I just ate the chicken. We finished our food & sat & sat until another server saw, took our plates & immediately left so I couldn't even tell her about the potatoes. Finally our original server came & dropped the check off. Luckily, we didn't really have anywhere to be & it was beautiful outside so sitting around wasn't the WORST thing in the world...just kind of a bummer to wait & wait.

I really enjoyed the chicken & the gravy was DEEEELISH! Was def bummed about not getting to enjoy the potatoes since so many people raved about them.  Hubby LOVED his burger so we will probably give this place another shot.I was very disappointed in Chevy's. I ordered the fajitas, which were pretty good. I got all beef. The chips and salsa were very good. I like a lot of cilantro and it was perfect. The problem with this place is the service. It took about 15 minutes after we got to our table for our server to come take our drink order. We had waited so long that we were ready to order, but he quickly said what can I get you to drink and ran away. Another 15 minutes and we got the drinks. You really can't mess up a beer order, but it happened. I ordered Coors Light, and I got Miller LIte. No No No. When I did finally get the Coors LIght it was hot. Enough said on the beer fiasco. To the food. I really like the Fajitas. They reminded me of Uncle Julio's in Dallas. Our server checked on us once but I think he was on something. He seemed really hyper and it was hard to understand him. He rushed to clear off our table before we were even finished. I would go back if I happen to be shopping in Arrowhead Mall again, but I wouldn't make a special trip. I am giving them three stars because the food was pretty good, and they are the best fajitas I have found in Arizona, but the service just sucks.This place is a great option when given the choice of the food court nearby. Usually shop at Arrowhead Mall for clothes since they have a better selection than PV. This is the last Chevys in town since they closed the rest of them.

I love the Sizzling Fajitas at this place and that is what I always order. It is really good and comes out on a smoking hot plate making all sorts of fun noises. The meat is always tender with a lot of flavor. The wife usually gets the Fajita Salad with the Sizzling Chicken.

Really like their homemade tortillas that used to come out of a niffy machine off to the side. Not sure if that machine is still functioning any more. Looked like they could have been made by hand this visit. OK with me.

The menu is rather large with lots of choices. The Chips and Salsa are definitely a score. I would recommend staying away from the standard items such as tacos, burritos, etc. There are too many great hole in the wall places around town with the authentic stuff for cheap.

Our server did a great job although he seemed to be overworked with too many tables. Saw several other servers just standing around. The manger even seemed a bit out of sorts as he paced the floor back and forth. Even saw a bit of the Seinfeld nose episode. Was it a scratch or the pick? Good thing that sizzling fajita plate is hot. ¡LO SIENTO!

3.25 STARSI remember back in the day when Hot Topic and Spencers seemed like different stores. Today, I can't really tell a difference as they kind of sell the same weird kind of crap. I went with a friend and they didn't have what they were looking for. 

At least the staff was knowledgeable of their store and let us know so we didn't have to walk around like 12yr old zombies trying to find something that wasn't there.My first visit to Mimi's Cafe was awesome, but I am becoming less and less impressed each time I go.

Some of the entrees I have ordered lately have been very basic and bland. The bread that you get before the main course comes is really good though, but my meals on the whole have been average at best. Their prices aren't very good considering the food is just OK.Arrowhead is a good average mall. It has everything you would expect from a typical mall and it is clean. The food court is ok, it could be better. 

The only problem that I have with Arrowhead is that it's lacking variety and pizzazz. My boyfriend pointed out that it doesn't have a lot of places for guys besides your typical Foot Locker, Dick's, and Macy's etc... 

If looking for your basics and no frills malls give Arrowhead a try but if  you're wanting more then try Arizona Mills or Scottsdale Mall.I'm not a big mall fan, but this one is pretty nice.  Good selection of stores on two levels.  Food court with your usual faire.  Overall appears clean and safe.  Parking is a challenge, especially the limited handicapped parking.  Worth a trip to do some shopping if you want to get indoors.Honestly, there really wasn't much of a selection.  I went here because my brother and parents wanted to go, but I was disappointed.We missed breakfast by 15 minutes, scream. If you have friends or family in town bring them here. Pancakes are great. If you don't leave with a pie you're crazy.I was looking for a place that served Gyro's and this place serves them. I ordered mine to go so I cannot comment on the wait service but the taste of the gyro meat was pretty good. I was a little put off by the overall condition and cleanliness of the place, I did not see any bugs but would not have been surprised if one came strutting out of the back at any moment. It just didn't look clean and although I did like the Gyro, I have decided not to return because I have a feeling it is not very clean and that means the food is probably in nasty conditions in the back, I would suggest they clean and make the place look better with some nicer furnishing and maybe some paint and bleach. Just sayin'.First of all, to warn the unwary, all the hotels / motels in Buckeye SUCK. This one, however sucks the least. I guess I was lucky, my experience there was not as bad as some my felow Yelpers have noted. Wonderful Air Conditioner. Price was less than advertised, WiFi worked fine. Beds are a bit "soft". Pool and hot tub looked toxic. I smoke so I was pleased to find a motel that still had smoking rooms that' were not overpoweringly smokey. As far as hot water for the cold water, if you are not familiar with Arizona, well, down here in the desert, everyone's cold water is hot during the summer. Breakfast was kind of lame too. Room was not spotless but not bad either. Nice staff. I give 'em a 3 1/2 outta 5.Not awful. The chicken fried steak was good. My dad wanted to go because he grew up going there, so I was excited. When I left, I didn't really see what the big deal was, but I didn't leave hungry!Meehh...this place is aiight. Came here for happy hour only to be disappointed by their limited selection. Even the beers are are scarce. If I were you, I would walk across the lot and go to Fridays. At least they have IPA there.The last time I went to TGI Friday's was about five years ago and it was great! 

I went yesterday with my fiancée, his brother, sister and mom and I can definitely say...I've had better! I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the first thing I noticed is that the chicken was extremely dry. If there is one thing I dislike it's dry chicken. I got past the fact that it was dry, but still wasn't very satisfied. The one thing that really got me mad was that my soon to be mother in-law ordered the pecan salmon and they were out. Now we were there at around 2pm "lunch time". Having worked in many kitchens, the one thing that's key is that you never want to run out of a featured item let alone at lunch time. Saying this..... it also means they will be out for dinner as well. She did choose another item off the menu but waited ten minutes after everyone else had already gotten their food. 

Other than that the service was on par. The atmosphere was nice and the company was even better.A typical franchised Applebee's. The buffalo wing appetizers were good and blue moon on tap! Friendly waitress and staff.Met some family members here who were in town visiting. Most of this franchised restaurants are all about the same. Food is basically OK, and has to much salt. Only thing different is their service. There were about seven of us, the service was pretty good. None of us had nothing to complain about. We all ate our meal, and had a good time.
Applebee's has never been a favorite of mine, but this location made the experience enjoyable.Go to this locations as opposed to other locations. They are fast and efficient here. You will still wait longer than any other place in Arizona but they are thorough and know what they're talking about. Much better than the Surprise location.Service is slower in this one compared to others! Hot & Ready's are NOT always hot and ready! You usually have to wait at this location no matter what. If your order comes up the pizza is cooked ok, and is what youd expect...Got there around 8pm and they were packed!!!  All the tables inside were full and the tables outside were full.  CRAZY!  

They had 3 employees working so the line flowed steady.  We got our ice cream to go, since the place was packed.  

Store the clean, employees are friendly, and the ice cream is good!A bit overpriced and the customer service isn't the greatest - a little on the detached, frosty-side.  But, the enchiladas are amazing - the main reason we keep going back.My family and I went there for Mothers Day brunch and I was very disappointed. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. Especially for $42 bucks a head. The dessert table was awful. Basic tasteless pastries and sprinkle covered marshmallows made to look like cake pops. I was only given one mimosa and our server never came back to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. Our total bill was $134.00 (gratuity incl.) for two adults and a six year old child. Ridiculous! I love the resort and will consider staying for a fun staycation but will go across the street to eat rather than spend my hard earned money for mediocre food...I do not recommend the brunch...obviously.Lively Friday night just enjoyed good Mex food. Chimichanga was really hott had to wait to eat it  :-( taco salad had strange lettuce like Arugula...not very mexi in my opinion. Inside lighting was like a living room kinda strange. Sit outside next time. 2 meals and a drink under 30 can't complain too much! Would return.This Zoo is okay. Bring lots of money because it will cost you 73 dollars for 2 adults and one kid over 2 and then all the ride.  The exhibits were a little lacking in the zoo side of things but the aquarium was pretty nice, especially considering it was in Arizona.  The boat ride and the carrasel were closed which was a bummer but the train and log flume were open.  Each ride costs money on top of admission and they only take cash.  Additionally the snack bar only takes cash as well so be ready for that.  

The highlights for my kids was the petting zoo, the train ride, log flume and feeding the stingrays.  A good place to take your kids but be ready to drop some serious money here.  After ridding the rides, eating at the snack bar, admission, and the gift shop I dropped about 250$.Wife and myself enjoy going to garage sales, and thrift stores. Trying to find that needle in the hay stack type of treasure. This goodwill location is large, and always fully stocked. My biggest issue has always been their price. I truly believe some of their items, you can purchase somewhere else brand new at a lower price! I know it's for a good cause, but my wallet is just not deep enough sometimes. Service is moderate. When you don't need help, they are always around! Then you can't find them when you do need help!! But we will continue to come by and look for that needle!1} THE WAIT STAFF  WAS WONDERFUL 5 STARS

We had reservations for 7:00 PM for our family gathering on 17.  They were going to set us in a banquet steal at several tables.  This could have been Communication problem I was not the one that made the reservations.  We were not seated until 7:30.  

Our table was chairs on one side and one long bench on the other.  Half of use had to slide a very long way to get settled.  This was not easy for some of us.  

The food was standard and typical Outback.  I do not like Outback.  I can not tolerate hot foods or very spicy foods.  You can not tell what you are eating do to the seasoning and marinades used.  For a lot of people it is what they go to the Outback for, the Outback Taste.   I do not eat at the Outback, it is not so much the food but the long wait and table arrangement, and then the non-a compensation for people that can not handle spicy... For any reason.  

I am one of those that knows what Colorado Beef tastes like vs Beef from Florida grasses.  *Chicken (Road Island Red/Wyandotte/Orpington etc.) and *Heritage Turkey that has taken time to grow up vs CX and broad breasted turkeys that go to markets in weeks and will fall over dead with conjunctive of heart failure if allowed to live to long as 6 mo.  {*note: price of these fowl would be $5.00 -$10.00 a pound).2.9/5 stars - Probably the best of the national "chain" pizza places assuming you order thin crust or the stuffed crust pizza. Pan pizza is a  1/2 cooked pile of dough...We chose to go to Red Lobster because we wanted lobster. I guess we should be a bit pickier next time. I ordered rock and Maine lobster tails. While the maine lobster was delicious, the rock lobster was tough and veiny. The service was excellent though.Great place for younger kids. It is like a mini chuckie cheese for those young aged children. Sends like thus place gets a lot of parties from looking at the spaces and tables for people to sit.  However, there is not too many games to play for the children. The food is decent tho, we got the pizza,  soda,  and cone for dessert! Not to shabby for my 2 year old niece/ god daughter.Service could be better, but everything is usually quite acceptable.Ok I really like Lowes I always have. The day I went to this location I did get some help that I needed but it took a few minutes that usual. First I needed some things from the tool area. I am not familiar with everything is so I was wandering looking for what I needed and also for someone that can point me in the right direction. After 2 employees just looked at me and looked the other way to look for someone else to help a nice man came to my rescue. He was a bit on the grumpy side but very helpful. I just looking and talking grumpy is just in his nature. When he was done he gave me a warm smile and pat on the back. Then told where I could find the rest of my equipment which was way on the other side of the store far from his realm. Then I traveled over to the outside garden area for some wheelbarrows. No one was working out there except for the cashier.  I walked up to him told him what kind of wheelbarrow that I needed and he goes I don't know look over there..... I am like ok where he goes I cant go over there right now I look around and say why??   And he goes there might be a guy over there to help you. UGH!!! so I walked over there pretty mad and was ready to just get everything that I need on my own. Thank the lord that they had the right wheelbarrows.  Suddenly a two man team came over there and started helping me with my wheelbarrow and cart. They did work there I just wonder why all the sudden? Was a boss looking at the cameras in the store see my look of disappointment several times throughout the store feel sorry for me? Who knows. Well any way I paid and the little boy cashier was super friendly with me then they all loaded my stuff into my truck like happy little campers. A-ok is my review just because I feel like it. This store is still clean and organized. There was a balance of good and unacceptable service here. This is not the first and I am sure it will not be the last and that behavior is everywhere.Good variety of items, but at least for my visit, lacking in customer service. 

I will confess up front that I know NOTHING about gardening,,,, or most home repairs. 
But in the LOWES commercials the people who work there happily & eagerly provide customers basic guidance and answer questions. If it says so on television, it must be true, right? LOL! Well, not so much. I found my visit as enjoyable as a visit to an auto repair shop. Feeling like I was bothering the busy people who work there with my questions which they didn't even pretend to understand & getting their curt answers. Annoyed, I turned to my other life lines for such situations; google & my dad. 

Disappointing.Had breakfast here with my hubby this morning ( we were going to red eagle but its closed on Sun) the place was big and clean and the service was attentive and friendly. I had the huevos rancheros and they were just OK , I also ordered some chicken rolled tacos with Guac and they were really good, husband had chorizo and eggs and he liked them. we had a bloody Mary with a corona chaser as it was after ten and the Mary was decent and the beer frosty cold and cheep less the three bucks. we live in Arrowhead so it's a bit of a drive but next time were in the area I'm sure we will stop for lunch they have a huge menu that looked really good.We loved the dishes...the only problem is the half portions were not enough to fill a lady (me).  The waiter we had was a bit busy and not much of a people person.  There was a point when he dropped a fork on the floor and managed to kick it several times so that he did not have to put his stack of plates down.  Maybe he should have just put them down...it was a bit annoying.  He was not very good with refills.  Hopefully if you go you won't have this guy.This place is easy to sign up for and hard to give up because all the other stuff it has, not just tanning. But the tanning is great!

The red light therapy is definitely my favorite. Read all the pros of using red light online. Makes you feel refreshed and rejuvenated just getting out of the bed. 

The hydra bed definitely helps keep your skin from being dry and the slimcapsule I've only tried once and love. 

The water pressure massage bed is pretty great too, I can get stuck in that place for hours.

I've only done the spray tan at the North Scottsdale location on Bell as it has the HD bed and I've had amazing results, no orange color, doesn't fade bad or streak. 

Way better service than the location off of 59th ave and the 101! If this one was closer to me this is definitely the one I'd be going to or the one in North Scottsdale on Bell.

Only complaint at 845pm I asked to use a service that was only 12 minutes long however they asked if I could make an appointment tomorrow as it was too late. As the two girls were sitting with a gentleman who appeared as their friend waiting for them to leave work on the couch chatting it up. 

If you close at 9 no reason you shouldn't take a service at 845, just my opinion, but that is nice compared to the service at the 59th ave location.I love the theme of this place with gourmet snacks, coffee, tea, condiments, beer, wine, glassware, etc.  Prices aren't bad either.  The thing that holds this place back is the location in a small parking lot adjacent to Old Navy, and they keep all of their beer at room temperature.  Since much of it is slow moving, that means it is at room temperature for a long time, which can easily result in bad beers.

Customer service is usually good here for me.  I'll continue going, but only at off-peak times to avoid the annoying Old Navy people that fill the lot.Visiting my son and daughter in law for the Christmas Holiday. My wife and I arrived early Saturday morning Christmas eve day. Broncos were playing against Buffalo Bills and since it wasn't being aired at his place. Decided to go to Fox and Hound to watch the game.

Haven't been to a sports bar in years, and didn't even know that Fox & Hound (F&H) was a sports bar. Anyhow, pleasantly surprised, F&H is more upscaled and accommodating then expected. Our grandson came along , 9.5 months old. a little bit of babysitting duty, The patrons and the servers were very easy going and didn't appear to mind that we brought him into F&H.  About and hour into the gaming atmosphere, our daughter in law picked up our grandson and took him home to nap, or have his own little huddle. 

Being Sunday football, they have various rooms with huge TVs for your viewing pleasure and separated out to various team rooms so you can watch your favorite team with fellow fans.  Our room included a good natured Buffalo Bill cheer fan who hooped and hollered every-time the Bill's out maneuvered the Broncos.  It was fun, our room enjoyed the game, even though Broncos lost. 

The food and drink was better then expected, Our server, Kendra did a wonderful job and made sure we had enough to drink and eat and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. we were there for about 3 hours, and never once did I feel rushed or pressured into leaving or having to constantly order something.

We had: Coors and soda for drinks.
Food:  

Play Action Platter: Your typical chicken wings,potato skins, mozzarella sticks- including Bavarian style pretzels and of course 3 different dipping sauces with this platter.  A nice little touch is when you order this platter, a portion of the proceeds is donated to St Jude childrens research hospital.

The deluxe cheese pizza with pepperoni - thin crust, crisp, marinara sauce, and enough mozzarella melted on it to create string bridges from the slice to your mouth as you bite into the slice and pull away. 

Ten Pack Bavarian Pretzels: Looked good and tasty with a pint of beer to help wash it down.


Cobb Salad: refreshing with their cider cobb dressing.  Should have asked for more dressing. I like a lot of dressing on my salads.  This was a good way to end the food after all the fried foods and carbohydrates we ate.

They also serve burgers, sandwiches and full entrees.

The prices seem reasonable, there was a total of 5 adults, with only 3 adults in my party from beginning to end of game and the bill with tax and excluding tip came to about $83.  2 of the adults didn't eat or drink much and had to leave early.

This is a place I can see going to time and again to enjoy sporting events, have a few drinks, food and be with like minded fans.  I will have to go to other F&H to see if it's the same atmosphere and climateThis place always smells like sewage. 

Yes, that's the first thing in my review, because that's the first thing you smell when you walk in the door. 

The food is fine. The beer is, fine. The only reason to go really is Tuesdays. $2 drafts. Pretty hard to beat. It seems like they have a great beer selection, but, they just, don't. I find myself staring at the beer menu not really wanting any of them. Cmon, get some real British brews!Okay, Pure Fitness....Here goes.

I love you because you are close to my house and relatively cheap. I love you because you are almost always clean, and there is usually plenty of machines to get my work-out on. I love you because you are open 24 hours (even though i never utilize it..) and you have a lot of aerobics classes. I love you because you have a nice locker room and a healthy amount of magazines to choose from. I love you because at least 70% of your members are fatter than me, and that makes me feel good about myself. I love you because you are not chock-full of meatheads who feel the need to grunt and scream like a bear in heat while lifting weights. 

I hate you because you have really annoying staff. The only two trainers I've had there that I LIKED have either left or been let go (I don't know which). I hate you because you don't let me keep my lock on a locker over night. I hate you because when I am walking out, all sweaty and disgusting, you try and stop me to sell me something else! wtf? I already give you my $21 each month!! I hate you because half the time when I get back to my car, you have put some sort of promo crap on my windshield. 

But most of all, pure fitness, I HATE your front desk girls. They make me want to stab my eyes out with their chipper squealing and incessant giggling. I realize they are supposed to be up-beat or whatever, but MY GOD do they really need to scream the songs on the radio in their nasal-y voices so loud that I can hear them on the treadmill?? And do they REALLY need to whine their hello's and goodbye's? Oh yeah, and do you guys really need to come over the intercom to make private, inside jokes so the entire gym understands you are cool?

Clearly, pure fitness, I have a love/hate relationship with you.Not the friendliest waitress but food was good.Service was kind of lousy. Came here on a holiday and so it was a mad house. Our estimated wait time was completely off. We waited for 45 mins when they told us 20. Food was good.Friend Mike C isn't much of a veggie, but I finally got him to try a Sweet Tomatoes with me, for a weekday lunch.  This was the seventh different one I have visited here in the Valley so far, & I found it to be quite average among them.  There was a good crowd of diners, but it wasn't too hard to get around, & to the food.  A comfortable booth was available, & everything they were serving was kept properly stocked.

As usual, all the food tasted fresh, & certain things were treats.  I really liked the cheese & bacon soup.  One thing I missed at this location was bread!  Yes, they had biscuits & focaccia (but not the pepperoni one that I like), but there was no sourdough or French bread, & no brown bread, as they have had at all of the others.

All in all, this Sweet Tomatoes was good enough to keep me coming back now & then, so I'll say it's "A-OK."     :-)

Lunch Buffet $8.39/$7.55 Sr. - Weekends $8.79/$7.91 Sr.Not a bad place.  I suggest signing up for emails and getting the discount, otherwise it is over priced-especially for dinner.  Watch the salad bar they have some meats they charge $2.49 extra for, and so not worth it.  Pasta sauce is good, but always over cooked noodles.  Love the sweet pot. bar.  Dessert isn't much.  If I ran the place I would get rid of the muffins and bring other things in.  Service and appearance about right for price point.The prime rib which is supposedly their best dish, was a bit salty.  It didn't help that they ran out of rare meat.  They only had medium rare.  The horseradish which was provided with the dish was not potent at all.  Even the straight horseradish had absolutely no impact.  The food was edible, but definitely not a place to go back to.This place is busy on Friday nights, and they offer call ahead seating.  Definitely do this, as we waited about 30 minutes.  

I had coconut shrimp, which was good, and had a lot more shrimp than I was expecting.  They are good about substituting the side dishes.  A friend who lives in the area took us here because the portions are always good enough to have leftovers.  He enjoyed his buffalo meatloaf with portabello mushrooms.  My fiancee had some sort of pasta with chicken and asiago.  I later learned it was cold and too spicy.  As we were somebody's guest, it was better to not complain.  

The bread was good, but they didn't bring more.  I suppose we could've asked.  The server seemed upset because we didn't order alcohol.  The food came out quickly.  The place is a little loud, but has nice decor.I have been a customer of this location for many years and I am new to yelp.   I felt compelled to write a review due to my frustration with the drink prices at Firebirds.   On a recent visit, myself and my wife split a NY Strip which was delicious and plenty of food for the both of us as we both ordered a salad.   The food here is solid about 80% of the time although I have had a less than adequate steak on occasion for the price ($28 for a strip).   However, my rating has been downgraded due the ridiculous prices they charge for a glass of wine.   My wife ordered two glasses of house merlot and when we got the bill, I was stunned to see the price at $11 per glass.  Never again.   What a waste for a below average glass of house wine.    Order a $6 beer instead.do not sit by the windows, you will be batting away flies the whole time!! We had to ask if we could move because it was so gross and annoying. Had the BBQ burger, it was ok. the sweet potato fries were fresh and crispy. Of course everyone comes for the cheesecake which is always amazing!Had a nice family outing at Hooters, and was overall happy. The Texas burger was decent,  and I liked it on the Texas toast instead of a bun. I made the mistake of having my wings breaded, which is my own fault, but they were still cooked well and tasted good. 

The service was good, and we all know what the scenery is like.....two thumbs up!

We found that on Saturday's kids eat free, which may not save a tone of money but it did free up enough to get a couple of beers. They actually have a fairly good selection of beers on tap. All domestics, a bunch of imports, and even some from smaller breweries. I went with the double chocolate and it was GOOD!The greek salad here IS THE BOMB.  Gyros are good too.  If you are in the mood for greek food check this place out, they won't dissapoint.Better than Barro's, but still disappointing.  Got heartburn after eating it.  What causes heartburn, anyway?  Still looking for great pizza in this area.  On an aside, I was overcharged  by several dollars.  Didn't notice it until after I left.  Check your check!Last night I met up with my Wife and my In-Law's at Abuelo's to celebrate my Father in Law's birthday, I arrived late to dinner after working late, but My Wife was nice enough to set aside some appetizer nacho's for me. Let me start with the decor, this place is a blend somwhere between a nightclub with large glass doors and ambient light, and a Central Mexico villa, complete with faux sky fresco on the ceiling of the central dining room, all centered around an odd statue of a man in a poncho and a child in dining room.  Confused decor aside let's talk about the food.

the Nacho's I had we're actually very good, they appeared to be hard taco sized tortilla's broken in half with a bit of melted cheese taco meat, lettuce and sour cream on them.  My Wife told me about this greenish hot sauce the waiter put on the table that he said was really hot, and no one else at the table was daring enough to try.  Generally liking spicy food, I gave it a shot, it had a little kick, but nothing like some hot sauces I've tasted, nontheless I doused my nachos with it.

For dinner I ordered the Alambre De Camarones, which was essentially 6 large shrimp wrapped in bacon, stuffed with peppers, served with a queso sauce for dipping.  The dish was also served with rice and broccoli (which I found odd)

The shrimp was very good, dipping bacon wrapped shrimp in cheese may sound a bit decadent, but you might want to try it.  The rice is nothing you can't get anywhere else, but still not bad. The thing that kept this from being a four star review was the choice of Broccoli as a side. I know broccoli isn't unheard of in mexican cooking, I recognize the difference between Tex-Mex and what would be called Mexico City food.
Maybe I'm just being a picky little kid that doesn't want to eat his vegetables (which I did, the cheese helps). It just seemed like an odd pairing to me.

My wife had a an enchilada combo plate with beef and chicken which she let me taste and it was really good, any both her and my Father in Law's meals were served with these tasty papas with cheese and poblano peppers in them.  Which I secretly wish I had instead of the broccoli.

All in all the meal was pretty filling, tasty and our server was attentive, so I can't really complain. and would return to AbuelosI was quite surprised when I walked into the restaurant...it's huge! Love the ambiance and the clouds painted on the ceiling. Got seated pretty quickly on a Friday night. Loved our server. He was very nice and got our drinks and food fast. I had a Raspberry Mojito and LOVED it...for some odd reason, a lot of bartenders don't know how to make a good mojito aka Lucille's BBQ but Abuelos does. The food was decent but I heard Arizona has subpar mexican food. And that's what this was. Pretty pricey and kind of an upscale feeling too so we probably won't be back. Located in the Arrowhead Entertainment Center and there is plenty of other restaurants in the area to try. 
**NOTE: Getting into the parking lot sucks!! No lights so you just have to pretty much cut people off getting into it. Good luck!!Not bad but not great. I prefer smaller local Tex Mex.This is a very beautiful and grandly decorated restaurant. The food was ok. Nothing that really had me jumping for joy. I dined and some of the hole in the wall places that had my squealing with every bite. 

I tried their mango salsa and it was ok. It was a little too sweet and I was expecting savory.  The ultimate feast entree was enormous. It was enough to feed three people.  Tasty and overfilling is an understatement. The ambiance was very nice and the service was great. A little pricey. Thank goodness I wasn't paying.I was really hoping that this restaurant was going to be great.  The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable.  The margarita tasted watered down and very sweet.  The enchiladas really didn't sit well.  Very mushy and kinda bland.  The salsa was goodMy love and I went here on our date night this week. We were served by Gabriel. He was awesome! He was very attentive and pleasant. We only ordered drinks and an appetizer- Queso Flameado Supremo. It was gross, and I'm saying that politely. It looked like it came straight out of the can. Yuck. Gabriel offered us  four different styles of salsa with our complimentary chips before ordering. All of them scrumptious. Joe and I have both been here before. Although we don't frequent this restaurant I wanted to enjoy the courtyard and good conversation If you request to sit in the "courtyard" with its beautiful blue skies. It reminds me of the shopping district in Vegas.Cute reminiscent "diner "with an unfortunate corporate feel. The food is good enough for what it is. Cutesy  3/4 attempt at a 50's diner. Not much else to sayeh it's chili's..This is a very popular place with the older crowd who are in the RV camps nearby on a Sunday morning.  The cowboy decor and decorations in the place are great to look at but it is a bit of a tight squeeze in there! 

Breakfast for four of us came to around $35 so it is a reasonable place to eat and the service was very good.  I had my usual eggs and bacon and it was good other than the bacon was a bit overcooked, still tasty but kinda hard.  We all left there sated so that's a good thing too.We were returning from the Laughlin River Run and stopped in Wickenberg to eat as we were having a Mexican food craving.  The Chevron attendant recommended Anitas.  We were seated right away.  Restaurant was busy which is always a good sign, I think.

Well, the food was just okay in my book.  My husband had the SHREDDED BEEF CHIMICHONGA and he really liked it.  I had the two SHREDDED BEEF TACOS COMBO.  The rice was undercooked and the refried beans were watery and cold.  The tacos were in a soft corn tortilla so it kind of fell apart as I was eating it.  The food was tasty, portions were average/small for Mexican.  We finished everything and ate a bowl and half of the chips which were the best ever.  We were hungry.

Service was pretty good, seating was uncomfortable and bathrooms are to be desired.

Just okay.It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!I first heard of Shugrue's on my facebook news feed: "... best rack of lamb besides ours: shugres in Sedona...."  I bookmarked the place and remembered to come.  I didn't remember the rack of lamb and got a half-rack of baby back ribs instead.

Dinner was OK, but the restaurant did not strike me as a vibrant operation.  We came on a weekday evening, and there simply weren't that many diners.  The menu is extensive, with choices all over the map, and I could just imagine the cooks sitting around in the kitchen, telling jokes and idly looking at crossword puzzles, waiting for someone in the dining room to order something, anything.  I felt like I had mistakenly boarded a sinking ship and wondered whether I should try to help plug the leaks or escape on a life raft.  I don't know when I'll next be back in Sedona; odds are that I won't return to Shugrue's.

For this yelper, the food at Shugrue's rated only two stars, but the day was saved by the wonderful gentleman (originally from Croatia) who waited on our table.  In fact, everyone in the dining room, from the hostess to the bus person, struck me as friendly, helpful and engaging.  I wish all these people well and hope that Shugrue's will see better days.Great view, friendly staff, stiff drinks and fairly inventive menu.  We wandered in here and were pleased with our refreshing drinks and great food.Shugrue's was our second choice since our first choice (Elota) was closed. I think we may have got the servers on an off day. We waited a long time to get served and that was only after I went to ask for someone to come take our order. It seems a casual kind of place and the few people who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves. 
Our food was good: That would be a vegetarian burger served as a "steak"  and a salad.
The views are indeed spectacular from the dining room. Looking at the gorgeous red rocks while dining is a 5 star experience.
It was a fine meal to have before heading out on a Pink Jeep Tour! With so many other marvelous places to try in Sedona, I think it'll be a while before I eat here again.This Albertsons is pretty average, but one of the better options in the area.  Reasonable service in general, but the checker was nice.  For everyday groceries, the prices are good.The store itself is not too bad. They carry health and beauty and over the counter medications you need. I always find the cutest Ty Beanie Hello Kittys here.  My xtreme couponer friends go crazy since they have good deals. 

Getting help here is bizarre though. Like in the twilight zone bizarre. The couple times Ive come here to buy random things the cashier is just standing there staring off into space. I stand there a few seconds as well waiting for the first movement then have to ask "are you open?/"  Happens every time I've gone here. It's quite comical.  

If you don't have your CVS card, which usually is the case with me since I hardly ever go here, they'll look it up and  punch in your phone number right? Well not this one particular cashier.  I swear, anytime this person is at the register he shrugs his shoulders. like "oh well"...lol...so Im SOL on whatever discount Im missing out on. Oh well!I have never been a big fan of Chinese food..but i have to say this wasn't bad...the fried rice was great and my sweet and sour shrimp was good....the crab Rangoon ehhh not so great.... IF i have a craving for Chinese again i will try againCute little atmosphere, nothing too fancy here. Just order, pick  up and go, or order sit and eat. Simple. We stumbled in about 30 minutes to close and were pleased with the service. Most restaurant employees seem to get upset when you walk in anytime after an hour before close. These employees were kind, and did not seem bothered at all that we were there. 

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice. The sweet and sour chicken was the bomb! The chicken was fresh with a light crispy crust, the sauce was perfectly balanced between sour and sweet and the plate was big and full. Not to mention the healthy serving of veggies chopped up in big chunks and spread around the chicken. The pork friend rice however wasn't my favorite. It was very generic fried rice with strips of chewy pork. Bleck. I will not be ordering that again. 

I would have most likely given this joint 4 out of 5 stars however nearing the end of our meal one of the chefs came out and let out a huge burp in front of us. Not exactly professional or appetizing. I would definitely order take out from here. I might not dine in again though as the experience turned out to be a little confusing.Nothing really stood out, they do have a Buffett but the section I had was nothing to right home about. They did have a nice salad/fruit bar. The casino section was clean but just seemed ordinaryVery nice clean park with awesome little league baseball fields. Bathrooms on sight. Running trail leaves from here and runs along the wash.Have visited this place three times in the last four months with my kids.  Daughter had bronchitis in December.  They gave her an inhaler and antibiotics with a do not go to school for three days note.  

January's visit made me mad.  I haven't received my new insurance card in the mail.  As a county employee, I get to go to UMC and UMC Quick Care without a copay.  (Yay, me.)  The receptionist won't call loomis to check on my coverage.  So, they charged me $70 deposit, as if I had no insurance.  The receptionist asked me twice if I wanted to still have my son see the doctor.  I said yes.  

When I went into the room, the first thing out of the doctor's mouth was asking me why I didn't have insurance.  Perhaps, I should have showed him my employee id, too, but was getting pissed at this point.  I explained to him the situation and that I paid the $70.  He asked me if I still wanted him to see my son.  Yes, I do thank you very much.

He prescribed an inhaler for my son.  Bronchitis, too.  No antibiotics for him.  

Let me say that when I got the bill (which didn't go through my insurance), it was only $20 more.  Why were they harassing me so much about coming there when they got the majority of my money up front?  I had to talk to two UMC billing people to get them to process my insurance.  I still have not received my $70 back.

Most recently, I went in when I was concerned that my daughter sprained, broke, fractured her ankle.  Why did I go there with all the prior hassle?  Because for no copay, they would look at her, take an xray, have it reviewed by the radiologist, and tell me what I needed to do.  All at one place and within 90 minutes of me walking in without an appointment.  Luckily, it was only sprained.    

UMC Quick Care still owes me $70!when you walk in the place speaks for itself. I like the Katsu Chicken. Im not pleased with most everything else.Came here a few times before and was quite frankly not impressed. The store is a little outdated. For such a large store they really don't have that many employees on staff.  I waited in the sneaker isle for help for ten minutes and nobody came over to assist me. However the store does have a nice variety and selection which makes up for the lack of assistance. I would most likely return just because of its proximity to my house, other than that nothing else really wowed me about this store.We visited this restaurant during the nightly happy hour and sat at the bar.  On our first round of drinks I ordered an Italian mojito (Bacardi rum, mulled mint, Campari and La Marca prosecco (4 Sips out of 5)) while A my wife requested a blood orange cosmo (Ketel One orange, blood orange (2.5 Sips)). On our next round my wife ordered the Italian mojito while I chose a Sorrento Lemonade (absolut vodka, Il Tramonto lemoncello and fresh lemonade (3 Sips) We enjoyed an order of spicy ricotta meatballs in a pommodoro sauce (2.5 Forks) which were tasty, but ricotta free from what we could tell.It was nice of the sommelier to come to our table to tell us about the wines & give us samples,  but after like the fourth time he disrupted our dinner I was ready to run. Too bad too because the chicken parmesan was really tasty.The Newsstand had everything I was looking for and it wasn't hard to find.  The coffee shop in here wasn't bad.  I had a strawberry Kula and it was very good.If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would.  Good deals on "health food".  I have had there  wine go vinegar on me years ago (and not just 1 bottle, try 5 different bottles).  But I have not had that problem again.  I usually only shop here when I need small snack for people coming over to the house.  Great cheese selection.  The produce is alright, but there are better in town.  Just because it's organic doesn't mean it is going to taste better.My wife and I enjoy eating here. No noise of slot machines ringing in our ears was a welcome sound. The food is tasteful and the service is good. My wife like the Calzones, but just make sure you ask for a lot of cheese and you'll get it. I enjoyed the Salmon and Fettuccini, it all was good. It came with one side salad and bread. We shared the salad. We had water with lemon to drink. The overall meal cost $31.23 plus tip.This is a tiny little Avis place hidden away in strip mall shopping center. Very few cars available. Don't expect a high-level of customer service, but it's fine enough. Unlike the Avis location closer to me, this one is actually open on Sundays. However, you can't return your rental after-hours.Nail Trix became part our sisterly pamper-me day simply because we were in the neighborhood, and this was the only place that does nails in the Galleria Mall. 

The service was good, nothing special. Our nails turned out real pretty - we both got french pedicures, my sister also got a french manicure.

The price was a little more than I expected. I paid over $20 for my pedicure. The salon seemed a little crowded - not including the patrons.As an avid golfer from Florida, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly as far as courses go. This place is not bad, especially for a muni course. We went in March, 10am tee time and got on for $65.  Got to call around and haggle a little. The course itself was nicely laid out, but played VERY easy. Almost too easy. My brother who is not that good, shot his 1st round in the 80's ever. I shot a 76 and rarely shoot in the 70's and this was at the 6500 yd tees.  The greens were not that good at all. Rolled fast but VERY bumpy in March. Their website boasts that #9 is the hardest hole in Vegas ?? Our foursome was a combined ONE over. There are harder holes on this course alone. let alone Vegas.
Would play again since it is inexpensive compared to other courses in Vegas, I just have a hard time paying near $100 for golf unless its in HI or a tour stop calibur course. 

By the way, we saw the cart girl so often, we were 1/2 drunk by the15th hole.  Gotta love it.Looking for candy? Well you came to the right place. This candy shop has just about anything you're looking for in a candy. From chocolates to fruit candys to gummys and pixy sticks. I'm a huge fan of gummy bears and I love the white chocolate covered gummy bears....can you say yummmmy! As soon as I walked in, I instantly noticed the worlds biggest gummy bear and gummy worm. Man I sure wanted to get it, but I just couldn't imagine scarfing down such huge amounts of candy. I haven't seen any other place that carried this item, I just wanted to get it so I can display it, but then again I couldn't imagine how much of a waste it'd be to have a gummy bear just lying around uneaten. Well this place is cool and all but I really don't like sweets as much as it sounds, but gummy bears RULE! It is a bit expensive though, but well worth it if you're a candy fanatic.Like itThe first thing to know is that parking here is a nightmare (as I stated in my check-in). I have an affinity for this type of food, so no matter how terrible the service is, I'll always be back.

This particular day I felt especially rushed. It's not like there were tons of people behind me, and even if there were, I can't understand or decide what I want on my burrito with the intense stare-down from behind the counter. You have to know what you like at this place, pretty much all over, in order to be a "good" customer to them.

I like Chipotle as a "fast food" place because of its commitment to the environment--love that they don't use antibiotics on their chickens. Using organic ingredients when they can, it's nice to know at the very least what kind of food you're putting in your mouth if not where it comes from. 

Even though this isn't the best Chipotle I have ever visited, it's close by and a good fix for the Mexican grill craving!I wanted to give this place more stars because of the service. Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.

I ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.

The specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast. 

At no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options.For what you get, this place seems a little pricey.
Lunch today was a chicken gyro pita and a small greek salad and drink.... $12... 
The pita bread was stale so this was disappointing since I love pita bread and was looking forward to a soft fluffy pita.
The chicken however was awesome!  Juicy, meaty, succulent... probably the best chicken I've ever had in a sandwich.  I have no complaints about the chicken.  In fact... just order the chicken forgo the pita.
The greek salad was small and drenched in feta cheese... and since feta can be overpowering (and it was).... I ate around most of the feta to get to the greens... there were no cucumbers in it... just a couple slices of flavorless tomatoes and 1 beet slice.  
Oh well.... it's good... but not worth the price so chances are I'll go elsewhere next time.What I enjoyed the most: 
Barbeque chicken pizza on wheat dough - they're perfect together

Other dishes were delicious too but not my favorite:
New York Style pizza - needed more mushrooms to balance out the salami, pepperoni, and Italian sausage
Grilled shrimp salad - very good salad that accompanied our pizza, will definitely order it again!

What dish they can improve on:
Duck tacos - go easy on the sour cream!

Service:
We came in a few minutes after happy hour had ended but our waiter was gracious enough to give us our first round happy hour prices! 


Why they didn't get four stars:
No beers on tap!I had the Margarita pizza, chopped chicken salad, and the crab & shrimp appetizer. I wish the appetizer would have come before our meal. The service was fine. The manager came to see how everything was, we told him great, except for the Trance Music which was playing too  loud in the background. That was irritating, not relaxing.It's Olive garden. We just go there for a quick bite that's better than normal fast food. Nothing outstanding but it'll do.Food just ok average but loved the service and especially our waiter Adam. That's a plus. We will come back and ask for our waiter Adam.Service was pretty slow waited 20 min for drinks. Server seemed sick and out of it. Food was greatAlthough the staff was fast and friendly, I wouldn't recommend this salon unless one is in a tough spot and needs their nails done, pronto. My full set was sloppy and over priced.This is a good family place to bring the kids.  I like it for this and it is fun as well...

a.  Ambiance - In a street mall on Sunset between Mountain Vista and Green Valley Pkwy.  With all the other stores/ restaurants here, parking always seems to be a challenge, in and out is crowded, however, not overly busy.  Inside, the restaurant is very welcoming, has seating for a wide variety of party sizes.  4 stars.

b.  Service - From the moment you attempt to open the doors, and instead the staff opens them for you, to being seated and having a server, I found the Service here to be top notch and a reason to come back. They will treat you and your family like VIP clients.  I give them 5 star.

c.  Food -  We had the 

Blooming Onion - not bad, gotta have one.

Chicken Rib Combo - Tasted good, way too much fries on this and not enough meat though.  3 star.

Sirloin and Lobster tail - Son ordered this and scarfed it down. Lobster easy to extract from the tail and the steak was tender. A bit expensive, however, pretty good.  4 star.

Mac N Cheese - My daughter had this and the consistency was very "runny" The sauce was not thick, more watery.  I give this 2 star.  needs improvement.

Ribeye - Served with Garlic Mash and String Bean.  The wife ordered this and I give it a solid 3.  Not too shabby, nothing to write home about.

Salmon and Vegetables - the salmon was pretty good, about 3-4 ounce service.  Yet, the vegetables were very typical and a bit bland.  The portion I thought was a bit spartan, however, I goes for being a healthy choice, it should be.

GK says check it out for a family affair.  Not shabby, especially if Olive Garden is fool and you are in the franchise, convenient and average type of food that I consider to be not bad at all.Good, but overpriced. Paid $12 for a pastrami sandwich. It was good, but either needed to be bigger or a few bucks cheaper.I feel really bad whenever I come to this place. They have really nice employees that are running around like crazy people trying to serve the drive thru and their dine in guest. My last visit here they had a long drive thru line and nobody but me dinning in. It took 30 minutes for me to get my sub because although I ordered before any of the people in drive thru they were so busy trying to get the line down that they made my food last. They are really understaffed which makes it difficult to make going here worth it. I suggest going before you're to the point of starving because it will take a while before you get your food.Great service, Great smell of bread, Free samples, cant go wrong here.

The one thing that made it one star less than a perfect five was the breads they had on sale made specific to each day. 

i was craving the walnut coconut bread (as I saw on the menu). Come to find out that it was only made on tuesdays and sundays. :(

I got another bread to sub for the bread I wanted. Its not the same. Also, I find it weird that they closed the store when they sold out of bread. I thought whoever owned the business should know what their sales are per diem and make enough product for that day. I guess they dont teach franchisee's cost management  info.Wow. You will NOT leave this place hungry. I made the mistake of getting chili soup and the chicken pot pie. I could barely walk out when dinner was through! The food is good, very filling and a good friend of mine swears by the ribs (she and her son come here once a week for rib night ;) ). Service was friendly. Come here on empty, because you will live with a little more than full tank.Better than most dennys in this area...service was ok...and surprisingly dead at 8 in the morning...so same food less wait...a smaller than normal toys r us. it was really packed today 2 weeks before christmas but unfortunately they had very limited selection of "Tech Deck" toys and NO Bakugan toys so I was in & out without making any purchases.I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!!!!!

I'm from California, I was visiting in Nevada and we wanted pizza. So the hotel we stayed at recommended Napoli. We really enjoyed it, the pizza was really extremely good the marinara is very zesty. I will admit that California cheese makes pizza taste awesome. But this pizza is really great, I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER PIZZA FROM HERE AGAIN.

We also ordered mozzarella sticks, diner salad and hot wings. The mozzarella sticks where really bland no taste what so ever. The salad was kinda normal, I mean really how much can you say about a salad, right. The wings where really tasty, but it did not make a big statement they where just OK.

But if you want a tasty pizza, you really need to try this place.It's been awhile since we dined here but decided to because it's the season when they serve their Pumpkin muffins.  

Lunch was a real let down for me. I ordered the quiche meal.  Now I have had this meal in the past and it seems to me the servings are smaller now. The quiche pretty sad and looked real puny on the large plate that had 1/4 of a slice of cantaloupe and a slice of orange on a little piece of lettuce. The menu says "garnish" w/fresh fruit though, so maybe I shouldn't expect a whole slice of fruit I guess. 

The quiche was a bit overcooked because the eggs were tough. So I just picked at my food, didn't even finish it.  It also came with salad greens but for a dollar more I substituted it for their French Onion soup. Now that was very good. Broth real tasty, and the cheese bubbling over the cup, I had no problem finishing my soup. 

My pumpkin muffin came towards the middle of our lunch because our server forgot about it, she apologized saying she was so focused on getting my soup to me before the main entree came out. I forgive her this time ;) The muffin was the highlight of my meal, served warm, muffin was moist, just enough pumpkin spice to it. My husband liked his French Dip, his had plenty of roast beef stacked between sourdough bread.
 
Service was great, everyone from the hostess up in front to our server was friendly and attentive. Just my entree was a real let down for me, unless I have a good deal on a coupon, this place will be like one of those last resorts for having lunch.Not a great place for vegetarians. Cant comment on other foods.I got the "Meat Lovers" pizza for takeout.: ham, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, meatball. By the looks of the place, I'm glad I got it to go. The pizza was okay. Just like a hundred other meat lovers pizzas at other pizza joints. It won't knock your socks off.The beers here used to be just HORRIBLE, and I mean HORRIBLE. However there is a new brewer there now and things have improved. Still your standard run of the mill beers, but at least they are drinkable now!

Thanks again Las vegas Beer Tours, without you I would never venture all the way out to this place for a beer!!I came back here two other times.  The first, I tried the BBQ chicken.  It was okay...I didn't really like the flavor and the portion was really sad.  I would give that experience two stars.

The second time, I tried the deep-fried chicken.  It tastes exactly as it sounds...yummy and crunchy, and nothing at all like Chinese food.  I requested that they give me the strawberry dipping sauce (the choices were plum or ranch, but they were accommodating) since I really enjoyed the strawberry chicken the first time around.  It was scrumptious and delicious!  Definite 4 star quality.  But all my experiences unfortunately average out to only three.

Definitely try the strawberry chicken or deep-fried chicken if you get the chance.  You're not going to leave full (if you get the lunch portions), but you will leave happy.*

*Not guaranteed that you will leave happyLove this place...don't always love the prices. :( If you have to pay full price and do not have any coupons or a discount for using your Macy's card then sometimes its not worth it. HOWEVER - they often have some decent sales on ESPECIALLY if you use a Macy's card. Downer on that -another credit card we all don't need. 

Still, they have a great selection of everything from clothing, cosmetics, furniture, house goods ext. 

So, when someone tries to take me here and they don't have any coupons I always say I "May C" about that.....hahahaha.The store itself is nice. I have been here many times and always find it hard to find an associate to help..guess going on weekends does not help.
This past weekend, I went to return something and was able to do so easily. I was looking for a particular fragrance that I found Macys does not carry anymore. The manager in the cosmetics section was very helpful and suggested alternatives which was great.
I thought I would try on some sandals. Liked a pair and found someone to help me get my size. She brought it to me and asked me to check with her if I needed anything else. I needed another size so had to wait till she attended to other customers, it being a busy day and associates helping customers and billing all at the same time. It took over 10 minutes and 1 reminder to get the size I needed but I understood the delay...the associate was very nice and apologetic.
I went back to the counter to buy the shoes and check on another pair I wanted to buy as well and asked another associate if I had to wait for the person who had helped me in case I had a question. She said yes.
Well, I waited for another 10 minutes..and ended up leaving as I did not have more time. 
I will go back again but try to avoid weekends. Also, maybe Macys should re look at their policy about having the same associate help customers and bill them too as they may lose a few sales as a result!I typically like Macy's stores but this one is lackluster, in terms of retail offerings. Proof of this, is out of all the visits here, I bought only one item, some years ago (using a sale coupon). I prefer the Boulevard Mall location, locally (I've bought lots of items there). 

The setup is fine- women's clothing, shoes, lingerie, handbags, jewelry and makeup is on the lower level. The upper level has men's clothing, everything for the kitchen and home (in the middle), children's clothing, and seasonal (yeah, Christmas items are already up, for all the early birds). 

There was a sale in the women's shoe department, so there was a busy vibe in particular. The store itself is clean, and there are many associates on the floor. 

We really like the parking lot on the side of the mall at Macy's entrance, which usually has empty spots. It's usually very crowded in the area in front of Red Robin (entrance doors).I've been here a number of times for lunch because its so close to campus and the food is cheap. 
Its not a bad value at all if you're craving westernized style Chinese food-- certainly better than the crap you'd get at panda express or other fast-food chinese. The owner is a somewhat friendly Chinese immigrant who recognizes his regulars. The egg roll is a tasty greasy spring roll that comes with that comforting sweet n sour sauce. The egg drop soup is tasty with hot sauce but I absolutely love their hot and sour-- feels great when you've got a sore throat or allergies acting up. I've had just about everything on the menu. The Mongolian beef is tasty but a bit chewy. The cashew chicken isn't bad but I much prefer the Kung pao chicken. The orange chicken here tastes familiar to the Chinese food fan but is still considerably better than your average fast food fare. I recommend  the house special chicken which has the sweetness of orange chicken but the added spice of sauteed red peppers and some vegetable. The fried rice here is nothing to write home about so I usually opted for the white for health preferences.  The portions are rather generous here so expect to be stuffed everytime you eat lunch here. Green tea goes well with the meal and is pretty cheap.
I really don't suggest you come here expecting an amazing dinner-- its more of a casual lunch spot. Its far from original or innovative but don't knock it till ya try it. They certainly won't blow you away but they just might convince you to come back.

[Edit: I've heard that the ownership and management has recently changed here, and I haven't eaten here in at least 10 months. It is possible that my experiences are not an accurate representation of what you may get here. Just a disclaimer.]Well its walmart, everyone knows what walmart is like but did you know that there are walmarts that compete with each other, pricewise. 
Ive found certain items cheaper at other walmarts and certain items cheaper at this walmart. One good thing is the items in the healthcare section isnt locked up like it is at Boulder/Flamingo. 

There are even a few vitamins/meds that are available at this walmart that arent even sold @ boulder/flamingo or the Lake Mead location. strange huh? 

The other thign about this is you cant get to the walmart from 1 side of the store.

The deli girl always seems so bothered by helping people Its not what she says but the way seh says it.I know she is young and this isnt her dream job but I hate to buy deli meats/cheeses at this location b/c of her. sad but true.I hate shopping.  Spending countless hours wandering through stores, pawing through merchandise, and coming home (ultimately) empty handed is my own personal hell.

DSW, is not so hellish.  I have yet to walk out of DSW without making a dent in my bank account.  There are roughly one thousand different shoes for sale and you're bound to find one pair ya like.  Even guys will find something.  Plus, if you join their rewards program, you'll get $10 gift certificates from time to time.

This DSW in particular is nice, quiet, clean, and never really busy.  Their staff are also friendly and helpful-something I haven't encountered at the Lake Mead location. However, their selection is not as good.  Often, when I can't find the right size for a style, I just head to Lake Mead and find it. Kind of annoying because I want this store to triumph and defeat the Lake Mead DSW!

Overall, a good shopping spot and I'm bound to be back....Went to Men's Wearhouse today to rent a tux with my friends for my good friends upcoming wedding.  The store was good sized and all the dress items were evenly spaced and very easy to peruse.  

The service was great, I would definitely recommend looking online and taking a printout of what rental your like so they can match it up and give feedback.  The tailors were thorough and concise.  I must say this place is great when it comes to the value and service.I've got to be in the mood for burgers, but when I am.. This place is "alright". 

The only reason why I came here for lunch was due to the fact that I work in Henderson along with me and my friend getting some shopping done at Galleria Mall. Otherwise, if that weren't the case I would not have opted for lunch here.

The burger selection is alright at best. I guess I can say I'm only a fan of theirs due to their bottom-less basket of fries with additional Red Robin seasoning - YUM! Their shakes are pretty deliciously as well, but this is a burger joint. You don't go to a steak house for their mashed potatoes, right? Same thing here: you don't go to a burger joint for their fries and shakes.

I can say that my waitress was a doll and was constantly checking up on us. I'm a big fan on excellent customer service, which is probably why she got a decent tip from both of us.

To sum it up, if I'm in the mood for some delicious fries and a good shake then I'll come here. If I'm in the mood for a good burger, I'll head elsewhere.I won't be I-Hopping my way back every time I am in need of a breakfast fix. It is a decent place to eat with good prices and plenty of food. My favorite is the pumpkin pancakes that roll out in the fall season. This is truly the only time I really go to I-Hop. I wait all year for them and just love them. You can get them with eggs, hash browns and bacon for only $5.99. Its a great price.

I don't usually hop over unless I am hopping through for the pumpkin pancakes at IHop, and I Hop you take my recommendation as well :)I would definitely recommend this place for Italian dining on a budget. It's as Italian as Olive Garden without the endless bread sticks and pasta so most people will accept it. I enjoyed the food and the servers did well. I was confused with their look; white shirts, ties and black waist aprons... but blue jeans and street shoes? Kinda blows the illusion of finer dining the white cloth tabletops and swanky bar gives, just as the open wall to casino floor spoils too. But they control the flow of customers so there is a wait which keeps down the noise and crowding so you can be more comfy and intimate. That's MUCH better than Olive Garden. If you avoid buffets, want to relax and not worry about having a bad experience while you are in the casino, Pasta Cucina is my pick unless I REALLY want Mexican... then it's Cabo.The food was good.  Service was fast..  and not one smile was given out by any of the employees.  Maybe it was a bad day to them..Not a huge selection but what they do have, they do well. Pei Wei is just a fancy Panda Express. The food is much better but the prices are triple what you would pay at a fast food place. If you're in the mood for decent Chinese food and don't have the time to spend in a Chinese restaurant, Pei Wei is the place to go. Good food but a bit on the pricy side.02/15/11 DINNER. ONLY DID DELIVERY, SO SERVICE NOT REVIEWED. 

Hot & sour soup quite good, filled with lots of stuff. Crabmeat fried rice good, not great. Panang duck was good, spicy, but not much flavor in duck. (Guess can't complain for the price, under $10.) Spicy noodle, with chicken, shrimp AND squid, was outstanding. In every dish we asked for spicy, VERY spicy, where appropriate, and we got spicy. Final price tag was HIGHER than advertised on website, even factoring in tax, so either they've raised prices OR they are indeed charging for delivery (even tho website says free with $15 purchase). Overall, some really good thai food, but nothing to go out of the way for.Decent place for Thai food, not spicy at all even when you ask for heat. Lettuce wraps are good but we boosted the flavor with some red sauce that was on the table. My wife had yellow curry and it was good. I had the Pad Thai and it was good, but a little undercooked in the noodle department. Tiny thin noodles, but I don't care. Good standby place if you are in the area, but sadly not a place we will plan to make a trip to.The price is right with coupons for this place.. Unfortunately I found salad not bad but the pasta too watery especially the Mac and cheese. Unlimited on all foods- salad,soup,muffins,dessert-ice cream. Parking lot was easy to find a place to park even though it seem small ?
The gal clearing the used dishes,very busy and doing her job with a smile..I like Sweet Tomatoes.

Especially when I utilize my email coupons and get a deal on dinner. Well, in fact i dont go to sweet tomatoes without my coupons.

When I got a good craving for salad and soup, this hands down the place to come. Their chicken noodle soup is a little bland for me, but once I add salt I am good to go and love this stuff. The potato leek soup is also very tasty. And when they have thier lentil and spinach soup I am a fan of that too. However their tomato soup is KILLER. I mean to die for. It basically demolishes anything else on their menu. I want some now just thinking about it.

If you are going here with a die hard meat eater, skip this place. For veggie lovers only. And every month, they have a new "flavor" or featured item so the soups and premade salads always vary.

Next time you are there, get a baked potato and top with their chili and some shredded cheese. Pure yummy goodness.

and you cant go wrong with their foccacia bread sticks. especially dipped in some yummy soup.Last night a few of us did our newly appointed, Friday night shenanigans.  Tonight we came to Sweet Tomatoes because of the value and location.  Salad, soup and dessert bar was about $10.99.  Now this place wouldn't be the first choice when I think of great grub, but my decision was out numbered.  Here's what I thought:

AMBIANCE:  The place is like a buffet joint.  You walk in, grab your tray and plate and then you start building your salad.  The decor isn't something to be excited about.  This place tries to fill a lot of people in a such a small space so there's not much of privacy, even at your table.  

FOOD:  Although the ingredients are super fresh, the salad bars were sloppy and food was everywhere.  I also appreciate that there's a huge selection of salad fixings, however, I can't stand the fact that places like Sweet Tomatoes tries to upsale and already high priced buffet with "premium toppings," like chicken or artichokes.  C'mon!  Get out of here with that.  Like any other buffet out there, it should be included.

I thought their premade Chinese chicken salad tasted good.  It was sweet and offered great texture with the won tons.  The Dill Potato Salad was really bland and not too good.  When it came to the soups, I loved the clam chowder and turkey chili.  I also love the fact that they have an area with all the possible toppings for your soup.  Remember that when you come here, do not miss out on the pizza type bread they have there.  It's located between the pasta and the soups.  SOOOO GOOOD!!

April, apparently, was their "Lemon month."  They served things like lemon muffins, a lemon pasta with capers and lemon molten lava cake.  The molten cake was way too tart for my taste buds.

Lastly, for dessert, I LOVE and LOOK FORWARD to their soft served ice cream.  You can choose to put your ice cream in a bowl or small cones.  They also have caramel or chocolate sauce and a bunch of toppings.  YUM-O.  Last night, I think I actually got full from all the desserts they have.

All in all, I think this place is alright.  In a city filled with buffets, many of which are worth the price, unfortunately, I don't think Sweet Tomatoes fits in that same value.  If you're looking for a salad buffet joint, Sweet Tomatoes is a great option.  Just be sure to come early because parking is very limited!All in all, it was just ok. One step above meh.

We came here to celebrate a recent life victory. I expected much better service considering we were only one of three parties in the entire restaurant. Service, however, was glacial. They were perfectly nice and cordial, just very very slow.

I ordered one of their special drinks and it took nearly 15 minutes to get it. Then we started waiting for dinner. I had to move my drink away from me because I was actually getting sick drinking it on an empty stomach. The food itself was okay...just ok. My husband's steak was overdone but he seemed to really enjoy his meal and didn't complain. I got the lobster and it was rather good. But, everything else was so salty I could barely eat it. Plus, it was served lukewarm. We then waited a long time for the check. 

Overall, I can see that would it have been busy, we would wait a long, long, long time. At least at Red Lobster we would have gotten cheesy biscuits while we waited. The prices were higher than at Red Lobster and the food not much better, the service about 1/4 as good. Sorry, Red Lobster is the closest comparison I could come up with for this one, and Joe's loses.This hotel is like a self-contained universe...I felt like I was in a biosphere.  There are lots of restaurants to chose from...all are pretty typical (not great...not bad) and well priced.  There's a fun area for kids and a cheap movie theater (spent a lot of time there since I don't gamble and I was stuck here 3 weeks for work).  it's a little ways away from the strip but it's nice to not have the drama of the strip.

I liked this place because I could eat alone and not get hit on - which was an issue in most places that I visited in Vegas.  DOn't get me wrong...I prefer to stay on the strip...but this place is a good value if you aren't into stain goon the strip!Experienced this place two weekends ago after purchasing an online deal. It was a bit further from the strip than we would have liked, but we got a good deal. Check-in was easy, however the rear parking lot in the baking sun was agony. 

Once we entered the room, the smoke smell was a bit overwhelming. Fortunately one of us came prepared and we solved that quickly. The room was pretty clean, and the beds mostly comfortable. Flat screen tv, but channels were limited and  weren't identified on the screen as the channel was changed.

Food- the Mexican restaurant had a great happy hour menu, with a great Coronarita for $8 or $10, the buffet was pretty darn good as well. On Sunday, go to the buffet early, or mid afternoon, as it was crowded and we went back twice.

We stayed Friday and Saturday, and on a whim checked the room out online to stay Sunday, and did so for an additional $16!! Yes, please!!!

All in all, this was a cool place.We went there for the room and the food and gambling. The penny slots were 'generous', the food was good, but the beds left something to be desired. I am a bit 'fluffy' and so if that was a stress to the springs... They need to upgrade the mattresses. 

Convenient and clean place otherwise. Smelled clean, not smokey, even tho its an older casino.Not what I expected...

I agree that the food is cheap and good.

 However I don't know what is going on here I am pretty darn sure that the person who takes you order is the server, cashier, and almost everything else. (except the chef)
I feel bad because she has to do everything maybe they can't afford to hire one more person idk. The reason for me mentioning this is because the service can be a little slow thus creating conflict.

The food is good and cheap as I mentioned if you feel you have nothing better to do and are on a budget I would definitely come here.The michelada is really what brought me here as I've been wanting to try it since I saw my friends postings. Beer of your choice mixed with clamato in a lime/salt/chili rimmed mug....so good!!!

Food is just okay, some were a hit (shrimp ceviche) some were not (fish ceviche). The raw oysters tasted fresh enough and the raw oysters topped with shrimp ceviche was delish.  The fish ceviche tasted "off", kinda mushy, really not to my liking at all.  I've had much better back home in SF...

The seven seas soup had fresh seafood but the broth was quite salty and lacked something...can't quite put my finger on it.. I've had better elsewhere.

My other half had carne sasada and enjoyed his dish, while another of my dining cohorts had the Alhambres- steak/chicken with veggies with cheese.  That was a bit salty also but their rice and beans were actually better than most places.  They served corn tortillas but were not homemade, same kind you buy at the grocery stores...too bad...

Overall- it was just okay, I would go back just for the cheladas and shrimp ceviche.  The prices are kinda steep, the bill came to $166 for the 5 of us, with only 3 people actually ordering entrees, the rest was the drinks and appetizers..3 stars only since I didn't like my food. I ordered a Campechana and they put a lot similar crab with mayonnaise.I from Sinaloa and we don't put those
Things in a Campechana but whatever.My family ordered shrimp  cocktails
And they were good.

Music was awesome, they had a Live Mariachi band playing but hey it's not 
FREE no no no!! We had to pay $20 per song ,luckily we only ordered one lol.


I probably come back if I feel like Mexican seafood and try some other dishes
On the menu,definitely ask how is it made  before ordering.I went to the sports book to place by bets and the line was very very long. But, I got through it in 8 minutes and made it "just in time" The sports book was very smokey and my clothes reaked. I wish there was a better ventalation system. 

I like the movie theater here. It is huge and plays later-night movies.

I also like the food court. Fat Burger and Dairy Queen are here.There's not really much I can say about Texas Station and have it cover everything and/or be 100% accurate. It is a very off-the-strip casino. 
What I can really speak for is more or less the hotel experience, what I have witnessed in the casino area and the food.  

My boyfriend and I have been in Texas Station Gambling Hall staying in their hotel for about a week, going on a week and a half. Overall, the atmosphere is "okay". Nothing in Texas Station really stands out, though if you do love the 'gambling-night-scene' you won't be let down.

The food here is really so-so. I'm going to have separate reviews for the places I have actually visited and eaten at, but it is all a little overpriced. If you want real food, visit the food court which has Fatburger (open 24/7), Baja Fresh, Sbarro, and Panda Express - otherwise, you have The Grand Café, Feast Buffet, Pasta Cucina and Austin's Steakhouse; this is not including the tiny, and horribly run, diner on the lower level of the casino where the Bowling area is. Oh, and they also have a Starbucks!

The people here are also so-so. There are ladies walking around in red velvet dresses that seem so droll I almost want to give them money to take a taxi home - that or give them an application they can fill out to get them a new job that they love. They basically wander around aimlessly, looking bored, annoyed and just unfriendly. I have yet to see one that looks at me in a kind manner! I'm assuming they are walking around to take bar orders for people like myself and tidy up the machines? Either way, they don't set the mood in the place at all.

The hotel portion of Texas Station ... actually isn't bad at all. Skimming through other reviews, a few people mentioned "eh" hotel rooms. Our room was actually quite nice! At the price it is per day, it's not bad at all. The only drawback is that you have to pay for your wifi PER DEVICE, which is $6 a device each day, and on top of that, if you need a fridge they will provide you one but it is $10 a day. 
Here, it seems the rooms tend to come with two beds - ours were full sized and very plush. They were definitely great beds to sleep in, super comfortable. Every room has its own AC Unit that is adjustable by the thermostat on the wall. You have to put your bedroom key card in the wall where it is illuminated by green LEDs for the AC to actually stay on.

The room service is good, but seriously annoying. DO NOT plan on sleeping in unless you have your 'do not disturb' sign on your door. They will generally come to your room around 9am-ish and they do this strange, silently knock two times and then enter routine while saying "Hellloooo?". Ugh.
They tidy up very well, though, I will give them that. Also the TVs in the rooms are flippin' awesome. We got a 25-30" flat screen in ours with decent quality picture. 

Over all, not a whole lot of complaints. $1 mediocre margaritas, conference rooms and party rooms as well as a wedding chapel area, a nice movie theater, plenty of good places to eat, $3 blackjack,  tons of slot machines scattered everywhere, a lovely and quaint gift shop, Texas Station rewards (get it!), clean hotel rooms. Worth three stars. A-Okay it is!This place would earn a higher rating from me if they took a little care in making the sandwiches. The ingredients are of high quality, but are used inconsistently and carelessly when the sandwich is made. It is not as if I am surprised, as they are assembled by young lads and lasses who are probably making something akin to minimum wage. Speaking of which, I find it a tad odd that these youthful people call their tips "beer money." Do they take the tips and wait outside a gas station, trying to convince patrons to buy them a twelver? Maybe they should call the tips "candy money" or whatever it is American youngins buy today. Old man rants aside, the sandwiches here are very good, and it is a great fast food option.First time I've been to this gym.

This is actually really close to where I'm staying during my trip out to Vegas. Convenience. I like that. My buddy and I parked and headed toward the front entrance. Sliding doors open to reveal a good sized gym. Let the buffness begin!

Environment: The gym is decent sized. It probably looked bigger because there weren't too many people working out (around 30 total). The equipment is spaced out with machines that isolate muscles appropriately grouped in the same area. Music plays in the background but it's not loud enough to actually enjoy (especially when the guy next to you is throwing weights around) or motivating enough to get you to work harder. The ceilings are high meaning that there's inadequate ventilation. In other words, you get to smell the sweaty guy next to you in all his/her glory. Wonderful.

Trainers: I didn't actually see one trainer walking around the gym. The only employers were the two at the front desk and the people fixing machines. The two "trainers" at the front aren't really role models for those trying to lose weight. I'm sorry for having to compare this gym to my home gym in AH but our trainers would run circles around the ones here.

Machines: This was the highlight of the entire facility. THEY ACTUALLY FIX THEIR EQUIPMENT IN A TIMELY FASHION!!!

Gym members: I don't profess to be of admirable physique. But, being an athlete for more than three quarters of my life (and having a few body building friends) I know a thing or two about lifting. The guys here, first of all, are much smaller than those back at my gym from home. Secondly, the "big" guys here don't work put there legs. I think the accepted term is "chicken" legs. Third, the "big" guys tend to stand around and talk a lot.

Recommendation: I'm always a big supporter of being healthy. Please go to a gym or be self motivated to keep healthy.It's a Walmart. I do believe I might have also seen some of the people in this Walmart on that one website. You know which one I mean. However, it is also a lot better since they remodeled it. They reorganized their craft section and made it bigger (maybe cause the Michael's across the way left?). The staff there are "there" but good luck if you need any help. There is no self checkout. 

The brand of kitty litter my cats like is the number one reason that brings me here. Cheap, cheap, cheap kitty litter. Number two is that it is closer than the Walmart on Decatur and 215 and far less packed on a Saturday. The store layout has to be one of the weirdest I've ever encountered but after having gone a few times you get over it. I remember having gone one day and they were completely out of sugar. Even the generic brand. I was flabbergasted to say  the least. They carry a few things I like that other Walmarts do not, and I can say that for everyday shopping it works out just fine.

A few other Yelpers have remarked about the "atmosphere." I do have to admit that I will not go here at night and that I do feel a little weirded out even in the day time and that is usually only when I go alone.As everyone has stated this Walmart is not in the best part of town or at least it seems to cater to people who desire to feel they are in a bad part of town.  The shopping area it is ha steely list businesses which adds to its decline.  All in all its a walmart busy, not sparkling in terms of looks and can be overwhelming to trek through.  If it wasn't for the lower costs at he pharmacy I'd likely stick to my target up north, but low prices are hard to turn away from.Big 5 Sporting Goods is your run of the mill sporting goods store.  They have more reasonable prices then Sports Challet and Sports Authority but their selection is sometimes lacking.  I mean due to the size restraint alone that Big 5's usually have they can't carry as much stuff as the other places.  That is also the charm of Big 5, whereas you would have to go through 3-4 people when at the other places, at Big 5 you deal with 1-2.  I think the associates are a little more inclined to take care of what you need as well.  An overall thumbs up for Big 5.This is an "older" target so it only has a snack bar and no Starbucks. It's not awful by any means but it's not that nice either, the store is clean and seems to be well stocked most of the time. The employees are also courteous and helpful when i've come here. It's close to my house and at least in a decent area which is a plus.The selection of toddler clothes left a little something to be desired. I was able to find something that worked but wished I had better choices.KKD has always been a nice place to take the entire family for fun and most of all doughnuts. I like this location because you can see them making doughnuts but when I was in store no one had on gloves at all. Now everyone was friendly and all but I would like to see them use gloves or at least wash their hands. Everything was just ok even the doughnuts themselves. So I give it 3 stars and next time I wont buy anything unless gloves are on. Truth is I didn't buy this time the husband did.Does McDonald's really need a review?

It's hot outside, so it's a perfect place to grab a cheap drink. I also like their McCafe coffees.

Food obviously less than mediocre, but we all love the dollar menu.

Line was horrendous around 1:00pm.What can I say about good ol' McDonalds.

Morning & Late night orderings lines do get pretty long.  Especially since its near the freeway so it gets pretty hectic. 

Had there big breakfast & oatmeal several times and the oatmeal is pretty dry! I wish they put a little more milk or something in there.
Also, i tried the dipped cone & was not good. 

But McDonalds fries are never a disappointment :)Easy to get to and in a great area - the District!

Parking - Casino parking, which translate to a bit of a walk compared to normal theaters.

Ticket Office - Not sure, it seems that only one person works there at a time and the line can get quite long.  Okay, more than one is there, yet they only seem to come out at the last possible moment.

Payment - You can use your casino points to pay for tickets.

Screen Size - Not bad, not too large. Small format compared to Rave.

Food - Come on, it is just your basic expensive fare.  Not bad though.

Bathrooms - Interesting that one is always busy and the other one twenty feet further is always empty. Not sure why they are selling mints and stuff in a vending machine and yet they cannot stock paper towels to dry the hand?

Otherwise- Small, utilitarian, simple and functional.

I go there often to see adult movies that are not at the Colonnade.

Check it OUT!!!after having chipotle for many many times, then trying zabas. i must sayyy chipotle is for beginners! who would have ever thought that sour cream and cheese would taste amazing with rice and beans? well what i do love more at chipotle than zabas are their chips and guac! the chips have a hint of lime that when ordering, i sometimes only get the chips and splash some mild tabasco on them. mmmmm!I'm someone who if I'm going to spend money on Italian food, I want it to be at least a 4-5 star type place. I really wanted to like this place. The service was excellent. The bread at the beginning of the meal was fresh and delicious. However the pizza was below average. As in I would stay away from ever ordering it again. The lasagna was very good. It tasted a lot like my wife's lasagna which is good, but we both felt to pay to go out we want better than we can make. I will probably try them again down the road to give them a second shot. Just sticking to pasta this time. To put my ranking into perspective... a chain like olive garden would get a 1-2 star from me. So they were better then the pasta co's, littering our nation. If it's this place vs those types of places without a doubt come here. But there is better out there.I am really surprised that there are more positive than negative reviews for this place? I am a really picky Eater from NY and feel I assess Italian food pretty well :) I was disappointed in my meal here.

I ordered the baked ravioli with extra sauce , it cam with a sub par salad that I did not like at all and did not really have extra sauce.  The sauce reminded me of Ragu or Delmonte from a can.  I know that it was made there but it was not very good.

I got a slice of pizza for my daughter which was decent.  I would go back for a slice but there definitely is better pizza around here such as Verranzos on Windmill/Eastern and Grimaldi's on Eastern.  I wouldn't return to this restaurant except for a quick slice if I was in the shopping center.Fado seems to be the default hangout for my friends and I.  Basically, if we can't think of anywhere else to go, and we don't want to think too hard about it, we go to Fado.  It's close and it's not too pricey.

The beer selection is not fantastic, as far as I'm concerned.   I end up drinking cider half the time, which is a far cry from the usual ambers I tend to enjoy.  The do have Smithwicks, which is a decent amber, but not much else I'm excited about.  Of course, they've got the British/Irish kinds of beers, but not as many as I'd like to see.

Their happy hour appetizers are very good, and fairly cheap.  The crab and cheese dip is tasty, as are the beef curry bites and the guinness mac and cheese (all are 3-5 bucks).  

Oh, yeah, FYI, there is absolutely nothing healthy at all on the entire menu, so...be aware if you're into that kind of thing.  Tasty, but not healthy.

The ambiance here is nice, and it's what keeps me coming back.  The bartenders and servers are very friendly, and there's a laid back vibe about the place.   Basically, it's as close to a decent neighborhood Irish pub I'm going to get in Henderson.pizza was tasty, just took too long to get it to go, and a few customers were waiting for their bills,had to run up the counter to get their bill ,so they can pay and leave.. I think I waited to order and take home took over 40-45mins,granted it was sunday afternoon?? Then one of the patrons brought his kid and gave him a few quarters to play on the amusement machines,all he did was beat on the return coin box,because he thought it stole his quarters when really he needed more than one to play the game? It was annoying..We used a groupon now deal because we were really in the mood for pizza. the staff was friendly enough and helped us customize our pizza- which we wanted with chicken and some veggies. It was well complimented by a cold pint of pale ale. Good pizza-- better than any large chain. However it didn't leave us craving more- I would say the pizza at BJs brewery is comparable. It's worth trying if you're a pizza junkie I suppose but its far from the best pizza this town has to offer. I think its a great place to watch a sports game and have some quality food and and ice cold brews, with better service than you would receive at a buffalo wild wings.My cousins, their friend, and I went here for a late dinner around 9pm on New Years Eve. We were expecting it to be crowded, but it was empty, which was good for us because we were hungry and didn't want to have to wait too long for our food to come out (as I'd experienced other times when the restaurant was busy).  Anyways, we ordered Mini Corn Dogs, 8 Boneless Wings with Asian Zing sauce, and 24 Traditional Wings with half covered in Medium sauce and the other half covered in Asian Zing sauce. Here is a breakdown of the food we ordered:

Mini Corn Dogs- Yummy. The cornbread coating was crunchy yet soft on the inside while the hotdog was hot. The accompanying spicy mustard sauce was good too. My cousin noticed that the recipe changed, saying that the new recipe was better as the cornbread coating was less doughy than before. 

Boneless Wings- More meat than Traditional Wings, but a little more expensive. I enjoyed the crispy coating and the moist white meat inside, but I did find the coating a little too salty.  

Traditional Wings- Mini drumsticks and wings deep-fried to perfection. I found some of the wings to be too fatty, but at least the meat wasn't dried out or tough. I also preferred the drumsticks to the wings because there was more meat to eat. I am in love with the Asian Zing sauce. It's the perfect blend of spicy and sweet, and matches so well with the fried wings. The Medium sauce was too salty in my opinion. 

Celery- Yay for negative calories! I wish some of the celery pieces had been cleaned more thoroughly to remove the hard-to-remove dirt spots. Also, some of the pieces of celery didn't seem fresh as they weren't as crunchy as I like my celery to be. 

Overall, we had an enjoyable time at this Buffalo Wild Wings eating, talking, and watching sports on the big screen TVs. Usually it's too loud to have a decent conversation at Buffalo Wild Wings, but this night proved different.If you've been to one Buffalo Wild WIngs you've been to them all, and this one was no different.  I tried to Queso Burger this time (I usually stick to wraps or their wings) and it was the messiest burger I have tried, good though.

This is a great place to catch your favorite team play.  Prices are average, Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best days to go.  Tuesdays are 50 Cent Wings I believe and Thursdays are 50 Cent Boneless Wings.  50 Cents or half off, either way its a cheap place for wings on the two lovely days of the week.

Wing Stop is still my favorite to go grab wings however (Lemon Pepper are the shiz-nit!).  

We went about 6ish and parking was pretty hard to find.I am here to use the WiFi connection and hopefully to get some food.  The place is PACKED!  The football games are keeping the crowd in the store pumped up.  If you are looking for a quiet place to work this is NOT it...lol.

I was seated at a table near the register so I get a lot of foot traffic of servers.  It will be interesting to see if they can keep my drink refilled.  When I sat down my table was dirty.  It took a bit before my server was able to come back to me.  When she did I pointed out the dirty table.  She apologized and cleaned it.  

I started off with an order of a side salad without the onion and tomato with dressing on the side.  My order came out quickly.  The salad looks ok but not overly fresh.  The lettuce in the  salad is a bit wilted.  The server was nice and said she would be back in a bit to give me time to start my salad.  

I opened my silverware.  The silverware here has changed since I was last here (a long time ago).  It is thin and very cheap.  The silverware also had water spots on them.  Not bad but not appealing either.  

I ordered Boneless Asia Zing wings.  They were good but a bit dry.  There were places on the wings that were not covered with sauce.  I later ordered mozzarella sticks.  They were ok.  I personally like them cooked darker so the cheese is nice and melted.  There was also not enough marrina sauce.  The little cup they brought out was only half full so the last two sticks of mozzarella were dry.  

My waitress on the other hand was very pleasant.  She kept my drink refilled and was attentive without being a pest.  The best kind of waitress!

This is the first time I have every had my computer out writing a review as I was eating my meal.  The staff was nice in letting me plug my computer in but be warned.  There is internet access here but there are only one or two places where you could plug in your computer and work.  If you want to work I would suggest going North on Eastern and going to Starbucks.  Lots of plugs there and free internet but you will have to fight for a table.  The students from Touro Unviersity take that place over during the school year!Well, tried this place over the weekend, and if I had only had a haircut I would have definitely given it five.  The place has an awesome feel of old school & personal most grooming places seem to have lost.  My cut was just as ordered...clean with attention to the "challenges" the curls in my hair provide.  However, I made the mistake of ordering a shave, which was actually the reason I chose to try this place out to begin with.  Unfortunately the shave turned into a vendetta against my face which required the painful addition of alum to a couple of mementos which are still healing...and had to endure an afternoon of anthills on my face which my wife was very happy and willing to mock.  So I will try another barber next time and hope to have better luck with the next shave...this place has potential, but we'll see.Tropical smoothie cafe is an interesting place, you can get away eating healthy if you know what you are getting. I prefer to get their smoothies as a meal replacement or add a bunch of protein to it after a nice work out. They do have some good food options; like wraps, sandwiches, salads, burritos and etc. 

The main reason why this location gets 3 stars is that a lot of times the team members who work, seem to only be there to collect their paycheck with minimal focus on customer service. I ordered a thai salad and lets just says that it was done in a hurry without adding all the ingredients. I barely had any dressing on it and the chicken felt like it was microwaved for 2 minutes. 

Good news is that you can't mess up the smoothies since there are quick recipes labeled on a board for each recipe. I got their new Island green smoothie with Splenda, Pinaple, mango and other island fruits made the flavor very refreshing. I would highly recommend this smoothie to anyone. 

Overall, staff needs be better trained and more enthused about their job at this location. Also, the parking is also pretty lousy.I love the fact that they have a quick care clinic here. Its much easier and convenient then going to the emergency room for something minor. We don't come here too often to use the pharmacy as we prefer the Walgreens down the street as they can be way more friendly and efficient. However, the quick care is awesome here!A bit on the expensive side, but they show love to a G. Lots of security guard type gentlemen working there.I am not sure that this place can compete.  I am all about hamburgers, 20.00 hamburgers and 1.00 hamburgers.  I have had them all.  This place is home of the 6.00 hamburger and for 9.99 deal here is the deal:

a. Menu - So easy.  Pick from just the basic Fatburger from Small to XXL which has like 4 patties....  They also have chicken, turkey, veggie burgers, hot dogs, chicken strips and salad too. 

I had a medium fat burger.  It was about 6.19 and by time I had the combo with drink and fries. 

b.  The taste - Uneventful Very edible, just not a journey, not orgasmic and nothing special... It was just very edible.  This is my problem.  For this price, I would rather have an In and Out Burger. Way tastier, so juicy, and the fries are amazing.  Here at Fatburger, everything was just okay.

So, while it was pretty decent, here is  how I would rank things.  If you want an awesome adventure and wonderful burger, go to Bachi Burger or to Capital Grille.  For 20.00 you get the best and you know it by the taste and juicy mess factor.  If you want best value, go to In and Out.  If you are in the middle and want a generic experience, then there are plenty of places like Five guys, Fat Burger, Smash Burger and all the same.

GK says, not bad, but I won't be a regular customer.

PS - Service at this place is really great!Looking for a good place to go when you're craving authentic Mexican food but don't want to pay high prices at some Mexican sit-down restaurant or pay really cheap prices for questionable Mexican fare at a fast-food establishment? Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:

Chimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). 

Shredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. 

Super Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. 

Tacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. 

I haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items.Not bad for a quick bite, but the sides are always dry and nasty looking! I've had the Stromboli and the Stuffed pizza. Pretty decent if its semi fresh but this place is King of the Heat Lamps! 

Need a quick bite of Italian? Don't expect 5 stars, but at least you'll be full right?

I'd like to give a 1 star for the Mac & Cheese. Or if there was an option for a -5 stars, that dish would take the cake. 

But the pepperoni is good, and the marinara sauce isn't terrible. 

Do I have you convinced yet? 

Oh good, me either. 

Decent. Quick, with a few good options.I wouldn't ordinarily review a Baskin-Robbins 'cos it's a big chain and you get the same product everywhere, but the guy working behind the counter was so enthusiastic and friendly I had to mention it. He greeted everybody as they walked in, gave suggestions on the product (I said I liked the reese's peanut butter cup after I sampled it, and then he wanted me to sample the heath too for contrast), encouraged additional samples ("hey have you tried THIS?"), cracked jokes in his european accent, and then later, as we were sitting there working our way through our ice creams, he brought by little dixie cups of chocolate shake ("hey, a guy just ordered a shake and there was some leftover in the blender so I'm bringing you some!") ...and finally a "Bye, please come again" in the most totally sincere manner...I went here on a lark with my lovely wife last week and had lunch.  The first thing I got was a nose full of cigarette smoke which is trapped in the front entrance.  We sat outside on the enclosed patio, and it wasn't bad.  The appetizer (a hummus dip and olive dip) was strange and not what I expected,  I couldn't call it wonderful, but once again, it wasn't bad.  My wife ordered a frisco style burger and I had this grinder.  It was the worst sandwich I have ever had in my life.  I took one bite and I was done.  I have to admit the waitress (who was really nice and a good server too) kind of warned me that I might not like it, and I should have listened.  She offered to bring me something else, but I just shared my wife's burger (which was excellent). The waitress was kind enough to remove the grinder from the bill, you will be happy to know I tipped her as if it was still on there! So, the place aint bad.  It aint great.  It aint bad.  I think I will give it another chance, and will update accordingly if things improve.My whole family went to dinner here this past Saturday night.  My mother-in-law is so in love with this place...not really sure why.  The bread and olive oil with herbs is probably the best part of the meal.  I ordered the chicken parm with fettucine alfredo and a side ceasar salad.  The salad would have been really great except it was three bites big...or should I say small?  My chicken was pretty good, and hot when it arrived but the pasta was ice cold like it had been sitting on the plate waiting for the chicken to finish cooking.

Nobody else had a complaint about their dishes but no rave reviews either.  

Our server seemed less than interested in being at work that night...she did perk up when I mentioned ordering a cocktail.  Don't know if that was because she'd rather be drinking than working or that I was about to bulk up the bill with an alchohol purchase and thereby increase her tip.

The chocolate martini was amazing.  That bears repeating...the chocolate martini was AMAZING!!!

I would think after appetizers, bread, salad, a main course and two alcoholic beverages I'd be stuffed...nope.  We ordered dessert.  It saved the day in my mind.  The buttercream cake with pineapple, banana, strawberry and creme layers...OH MY GOD!!!!  Skip the food and go straight for dessert here!  So light and fresh tasting.  Not overwhelmingly rich like so many deserts.  

For the money...I'd rather have gone to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill...but if you want a chocolate martini and dessert, this was great!Carrabba's is in this weird position of being somewhat yuppie acceptable, yet is still a chain.  I think most people go here just so they put themselves over for not going to Olive Garden.  I'm not an Olive Garden fan by any stretch of the imagination, but I much rather go there than here.

The service is fine.  It doesn't get too crowded here.  The atmosphere is alright.  It's dim without being dark.

Really I just choose Olive Garden over this is because of price.  Carraba's wants to charge everyone just a little bit extra so that you'll feel fancy.  I've had other things, but a good and fresh example in my mind is the Caesar salad I had last night.  Switching from chicken to shrimp was in the neighborhood of 4 dollars.  The salad had exactly 4 pieces of shrimp.  $1 per shrimp is a bit ridiculous.  But in general the food tastes fine.  No complaints about the taste.  It's just the price that bothers me.I have heard many wonderful comments about BMG and have ignored the mixed ratings on this place. I came here with my sister and one of her friends for lunch. In no rush, we just ordered a few items for the table and shared. 

The spinach and mushroom dip is by far the best item. It does not feel as heavy or taste as creamy as most dips. It was not weighed down by cream cheese or mayo and had the consistency of a light creamed spinach. Most of the other items were either bland or off putting so we just dressed everything in it. Since we were unsure about what to order, we decided on  a mixed grill plate. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. The chicken was moist and possessed the most flavor. The sausage was nothing special. The filet was the biggest disappointment. It did not have any taste and not cooked to our specification. This platter comes with mashed potatoes and veggies. We asked for the jalapeno cheddar potatoes and it was a huge mistake. My sister was dying and I just taste anything but jalapenos. The consistency was close to the stuff from a box. Our last item was the steak salad. The dressing was sparse and flavorless. Parboiled potatoes also top the salad. Everyone thought they were pears or apples and was shocked by the crunchy tuber...

The overall experience was mixed, but one thing we all agreed on was our love of the dip. It is definitely worth going back for that.February 2013 

I am kind of a French Onion soup snob... I have to say... I enjoyed their version very much! Pizza was pretty good, too! :-)

Looking for late night fare in Henderson... this is your place!

your constant companion,

~deirdarI was taken to this place by a vendor from my work, so it was free meal. But a review is a review and I was not very impressed with this restaurant. When we got to our table the waiter was forcing us to order food as quickly as we can, which is a big no in my book, especially when half of the restaurant is empty. They kept interrupting us when I was explaining the vendor on how the chemical plant works, so I had to back track constantly. 

I got french onion soup to start me off, and it was probably the most disgusting french onion soup ever. the cheese took up about 1 inch of the bowl and when I finally broke through that layer all the cheese was literally coating the spoon. There was an inch of cheese coating the spoon, which made it unusable for the task. I felt like I was part of a deep sea drilling operation. After barely having any soup, I awaited for my main entree, the hanger steak. 

One thing that I did want to mention before I move on to my meal. The cowboy steak is more of a place holder item to attract customer. They never have enough and it will always be sold out. We got there for dinner around 6PM, and they were all out of it. I also stopped by next day around 4:30PM to see if they had it in stock, but it was gone. So, if you are going just to get the cowboy steak then be cautious. They do have other alternate steaks and this is why I got hanger steak. 

The hanger steak that I got was done medium rare, just as I had asked. It was very flavorful and the the garlic mashed potatoes was perfect match for this steak. 

But its hard to look over bad service and french onion soup, so over all its 3/5 stars. On a plus size this place is open 24 hours, and they do have good late night specials.Sadly after my husband I both got food poisoning I have to take off a couple stars. If you like rolls - this still is the best place in Vegas to go ! Their cooked food is decent as well. If you're a sashimi/nigiri fan I would take your business down the street to En.I used to LOVE this restaurant. I think their rolls are out of this world good. 

But thinking about the service, I barely wanna give this place 1 star. The older Korean ladies who just care about the table turnover is just not acceptable. So rude. 

But the food.... I guess it keeps me coming back. Something wrong#69. Have to get it everytime. Soft-shell crab roll with assorted fish on top and screaming orgasm sauce on the side.. Maybe I should get it for to-go so I don't have to go through another hellhole of service.The sushi is Yum, but if you have to eat gluten free I wouldn't recommend it. They aren't too knowledgeable about Gluten Free and I always leave with a tummy in pain no matter how plain I get my food. They do have a gluten free soy sauce which helps, but the staff isn't too knowledgeable on it so be very careful. They are pretty pricey as well.This is my sister's favorite sushi place and I've been here a handful of times while visiting her. I wouldn't say they have the highest quality fish but their rolls are very tasty. And they have a large variety of them. All your favorites are on the menu plus quite a few that I think they made up. If you like trying maki with crazy combos then this place is for you. If you are more of a nigiri / sashimi sushi eater then I would probably go elsewhere.

PS they have a full bar and also make some pretty decent cocktails!This place used to be fun to go to when I was younger, it is not the same as I remember. And the food is just soso.I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!
Demand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!This place is small... Service is slow. And there's a particular waitress that really doesn't give a damn and you just know she hates her job. 

Sushi presentation and flavor differ every time we come here. But the fish tastes fresh. Our favorite is the touch down roll and tiger roll.

We would be here more often if we were more welcomed.I don't understand why they eliminated their $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe meal and if I am correct, raised the price on fries in the middle of a recession. I do understand that it has alienated customers, such as myself.
  Recently I had been eating here so frequently that I became the duke of this Wendy's. The employees are friendly and the dining area is generally clean.
  I have lowered the rating by a star. Eliminating a good deal during a recession lowers my opinion of the place.Jamba Juice and I have a love-hate relationship.  I love me a good smoothie, but I am bothered by the high price charged for each drink.  Every time I step foot in this place I'm shocked by the prices.

So here's our routine: every 1-2 months, I will get a serious craving for a smoothie.  I'll stop in to Jamba Juice and start drooling ever so slightly staring up at the menu.  Then I'll read the prices next to the drinks, get grumbly and upset that I came back to the store knowing that the drinks are so overpriced.  But I will order anyway, thinking I shouldn't waste the journey over there and, after all, I did want a smoothie.  So I order a berry blend smoothie, overpay, and wait for my drink in a cloudy mood.  The berry smoothie arrives and I walk out the door.

On on my way across the parking lot, as I berate myself for being dumb enough to come back to Jamba Juice and pay so much, I take my first sip.  On my way to work, I sip some more and some more and by the time the smoothie is halfway done, I'm so in love with its taste that I've forgotten dollars and cents.  I'm on a berry high, drifting in a magical mist of sweetness where money has no meaning.  Man, I love a good smoothie.

And so the quality smoothie induces amnesia.  And 1-2 months later, I am back at Jamba Juice repeating my cycle.I've been looking for a restaurant supply store in the Las Vegas area since moving here a few months ago. So I was excited to find this place on Yelp. It's a great little store but to be honest, I was a little disappointed with the size/selection of the store. I didn't find everything I was looking for. On the up side the stuff was friendly and helpful. The supplies they did have on hand were reasonably priced. Overall not a bad trip.Unless you have an appointment, expect to wait between 30 minutes to 2 hours (depending on business levels). Make sure you have all the necessary documents and ID or else you will be turned away or end up waiting longer. For the most part the people that work here are pretty nice and cordial. Sometimes, they can be rude and condescending. I understand their frustration when dealing with irate, obnoxious and moody patients that always think they should be first in line. Getting your blood taken is never fun, make sure you bring a book or something to keep you occupied while you wait. Always be prepared for an unpleasant experience.Some nights I crave a de-stress sushi to get my head back in the game and I tried this place for one of those very nights.

I've had pick-up here before but considering I only ordered egg drop soup that does not make a very enticing review, now does it?  (For the record, the egg drop is OK.)

When I actually came for sit-down, it was relatively empty.  I think it was early Friday evening (5ish), too.  We got a nice booth right away that had a great view of the projection TV in front of the fish tank.  There is a sushi bar, teppanyaki grill and even private rooms for parties.  Good setup for everything - not too crowded or busy.  I applaud that.

The server was nice; overall was above average.  She did not talk to us much but made sure I had water.  Brownie points!  I got my Dragon Roll and my fiancé got his edamame in a reasonable amount of time and both were above average but not great.  I would definitely come back for the sushi over Xtreme Sushi (Pebble/Eastern area).  We got green tea ice cream to finish off our mini-dinner before running errands.

Now here is what threw me off.  When it came time to pay, I whipped out my card ... and the server brought over the portable card machine.  It was really, really awkward.  She had already slid my card so I had to enter the tip via machine then print it out.  I didn't want to leave the machine on the table but we were also ready to go and she didn't come around the dining floor for awhile.  My fiancé ended up flagging her down when she popped up and she took the huge bulky machine back.  Remember cell phones in the 80s?  Akin to that.

Overall, it was a solid OK experience.  I'd go back, but I just don't have any immediate plans on it.  I thought about getting a coupon through restaurant.com but it doesn't apply to the AYCE.  Tch.Great: pot stickers, crab rangoon, fried rice. Good: egg rolls, sushi, beef and broccoli. Meh: sweet and sour chicken, banana split. Over all a really good place with a lot of options, decent prices and a good vibe.Decent service, decent food.  Just the right amount of food.  Didn't care for the coleslaw though.  A little bland.I was having my pizza cravings...  Read the Yelp! reviews and Rosati's Pizza got my attention.  So, I went online to check out the menu and called in to order a Thin Crust Chicken Alfredo Pizza but to please hold the tomatoes.  FYI, the online menu showed:  Grilled Chicken, Sautéed Spinach, Tomato and Alfredo Sauce.  However, when our pizza came, there were only Grilled Chicken and Onions.  Uh... where are the spinach?!  Why are there onions instead?!  

I also ordered "White Pizza" or "Bianca Pizza".  The online menu showed: Olive Oil, Fresh Garlic, Sautéed Spinach, Fresh Sliced Tomatoes and Basil.  However, when our pizza came, I couldn't taste the garlic or basil.  Seriously?!   

Let's just say that I wasn't happy.  So, I picked up the phone and complained about the mistakes and to my surprise, a very nice gentleman who answered the phone was extremely apologetic.  He explained that the online menu for Chicken Alfredo pizza was incorrect -- actually it should have "onions" instead of "spinach" -- but he also acknowledged that that was not my problem and he'll report that and will get that fixed online.  In fact, he was so cool ... he thanked me for taking the time to call and told me he'll "credit" my next order just to get my business to come back and give them another try.  I was resistant at first ... but his tone was so genuine that I thanked him for his offer.     

To top it off, he called me back after we hung up and apologized for being rude and not asking me if I would like "new pizzas with the correct ingredients" on them.  Thank you, I really appreciate the offer -- but I can only eat so much carb for one night.   :-)  

I'm definitely a FAN for the exceptional "care" that was given AFTER the mistakes were made. However, I'm giving this place a 3-star for now... simply base on tonight's "whole experience".   Overall, the pizza had the "right" amount of cheese on them and the crust was perfectly crispy.  I just wish I knew how it would have tasted with the "right" ingredients. 

Stay tuned for my "credit" order review!  LOL.I'm stunned this place is getting 5 stars consistently. Let me be the first to tarnish its near-perfect rating with a medeocre, but unbiased review. 

The Artisan isn't bad. We went on a First Friday, the night when all the arty nightcrawlers come out.  There was a generous-sized crowd there, making it rather difficult to get a drink. Luckily we knew a cocktail wench that works there and got a comped round (even though she totally burned one of our buddies and totally stole all his shit ... but that's a different review, different day). This was the first time I've ever been and I've heard friends say they've been when they were just about the only party there. 

Valet is a requirement. Unless you want to park in the lot of the adjacent with the "Will tow at owner's expense" signs all over the place. 

This place is like Narnia: kind of hard to find. Come from the west side of Sahara and turn right onto Highland. Otherwise, I don't know what to say. 

The decor is pretty garish. They have all of these prints of Da Vinci's, Degas', Renoirs, whatever all done up in these guilded frames. Which isn't a bad thing, if it weren't for the fact that the walls were densly packed with these things. 

They did some innovative things with decor, it wasn't all that bad. 

The DJ was on fire, though. He was the big redeeming point about the place. 

The place isn't suitable for large parties ... as there was like eight of us. 

As shwag as it was, I thought it was odd that they had ESPN on the monitors. 

I will give the Artisan credit for being different from the rest of Vegas. Even though it is kind of the dark side of Roccoco. 

In all fairness I haven't checked out the rest of the hotel, so I couldn't give a thourough review. All we saw was the lounge and the men's bathrooms for a hot minute while we banged in the stalls. jk. It was more like two hot minutes.its a cool chill stopThis review only applies to the hotel because I'm just not cool enough to stay up late for afterhours. We booked a room here for two nights when we drove out to run the rock and roll half marathon. Usually we stay further off strip (Green Valley, the M) but wanted to be a bit closer this time for convenience and they had super reasonable room rates so we took a chance.

I was well aware of the after hours loudness situation so when we checked in, I mentioned we'd appreciate a quite-ish room if at all possible and were put on the 5th floor. Speaking of check in, the girl working the desk was incredibly friendly and awesome. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name but, Girl who used to work at the hotel in Santana Row - you were wonderful! The decor throughout the lobby and in the room is unique and interesting. A nice touch of personality in a city full of homogeneous hotels. 

So, why the 3 stars you ask? We slept terribly. It actually had NOTHING to do with the after hours club. We could hardly hear the music on the fifth floor (occasionally we could pick up on the bass if it was quiet in the room, but nothing disruptive at all), but you could here A TON of road noise from Sahara/ the 15 / emergency vehicles. Our window faced Sahara and it was LOUD. Usually some road noise doesn't bother me, I've lived in cities and busy suburbs but this was bad. Big rig horns, sirens, people honking for fun it seemed. In general I'm a fairly light sleeper but I was awoken close to once an hour because something loud was happening.

I would for sure go here for a drink in the lounge to show someone the cool decor, but even if you're having a Vegas party trip you want to nap quietly for a few hours at some point of the day or night and the street noise was too consistent to allow for resting, so I personally wouldn't stay here again.The wonton's pretty good -- big and full of meats. We tried some crispy pork stomach that was rather tasteless. The red bean drink (and probably the rest of them too) was not worth it (full of ice.) Otherwise what you would expect from an average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.Wonton noodle soup- that is the only thing we order all the time.Boy this is the nicest decorated pho restaurant I ever been too!  The tables and flooring were all different from the usual pho places in the Bay Area, it was clean!  The pho itself was decent, nothing really that special, but it was good.  Its located in this Asian Plaza on this Asian Street, felt like I was back in Cupertino or something.  Anyways cheap ok food quick is always good!Was visiting LV August 2008, now found out I'll be moving there permanently soon.  Went here for lunch one day, and the meal (pho) itself wasn't bad.  The broth was tasty, the proteins were good (I forgot what I ordered) and the serving size was also good.

I guess my issue when I went there was that whenever the wait staff would give me my beverage or check, it was placed at the end of the table away from me, which I found to be unusual.  For example, since I ate lunch by myself, I had a single table that seats only two people.  The bev/check was actually placed at arm's length.  Is that a Viet thing?  I'm pretty sure it was the wait staff's perceived issue with me.

But, as I mentioned before, I'm moving to LV soon and willing to give these folks another go.  Love Asian food, being Asian myself, and would really hate to not come here because I perceive some kind of issue or displeasure with me.Had dinner here on Monday night.  We ordered half a hai nan chicken, oyster hot pot, salt and pepper shrimp, and the pork chop combo rice plate.  The shrimp and the hot pot were good.  The hai nan chicken had no flavor at all.   The shredded pork in the combo plate came out cold.  It wasn't great but it wasn't awful either...  so hence the 3 star rating.they get the job done. they don't even have a 24 hour joint like this in the bay. what's up with that?Haven't always been a big fan of pho but this place gets the job done after a weekend of heavy intoxication. Soup, in general, cures a lot for me! The regular bowl was a good size. It had just enough noodles and soup. Though it would've been better if they added more brisket and steak. Gotta love that extra meat! Waiters seemed funny here probably because I couldn't fully understand their jokes but I guess it made up for the o-k service. The extra star really belonged to the desserts I tried on my recent visit. There were these ice cream balls called exotic bomba and bomba. (Filipinos, don't get any dirty ideas!) Both were actually pretty good. The exotic bomba had a fruitier taste coated with white chocolate and the bomba had a coffee taste coated with milk chocolate. Once again, I was suckered into the sweets!This is the go to spot for late night meals when we have a rental car and cruise over to Spring Mountain.  We've probably tried it all here.  Pho, entrees, congee...never had a bad experience. 

Love getting the spring rolls w/ lettuce wraps.  Not sure why more don't serve it like this w/o having to ask.

It's convenient, open all the time and hits the spot.EH....... I'd prob only come here for a drunk after hours bowl of pho. We came here sober, in hopes to cure some of our hangovers with a tasty bowl of pho, but to our disappointment the soup was really off and a tad bit over priced, but of course non comparable to T.I's pricing.. but that's a whole different story. So, long story short... this place is not that great.Looking for authentic food, not too far off the strip, this place will hit the spot. You gotta visit just to "check-in" coz of the name alone. Took me a while to figure it out ;/ Busy, busy, busy but lots of seating. Customer service is average as expected. Huge selection and great for big crowds. Kinda smells and not sure how clean the place is.A great run for some late night pho. Whenever I go to a pho restaurant, I tend to order the same thing - beef flank noodles and fried egg rolls - for a couple of reasons 1) they're the perfect match 2) comparison purposes. I gotta say it was just as good as Pho So 1 by Decatur and Spring Mountain. Service was smooth and speedy. I have yet to know (or so I doubt) that they replace their vermicelli noodles with the yellow egg noodles. till then, i'll rate it 3 stars up for now.24hr pho in Vegas? Definitely a need when you've had a few drinks for the night, which is why my friends and i came here. It's not too far off the strip, which is a plus and it's open 24hrs.

Food wise i would say this place could do better, but it's not bad. The only problem i have with this place is when I ordered a Large Pho Tai i was given only 6 slices of meat (lol a large and all you get is 6 slices of beef??)

The prices at Pho Kim Long is a bit pricier than i'm used to for pho (around $8 a bowl), but since we were in Vegas I wont be complaining that much on the price

Overall it was a decent experience and i would recommend anyone who has a hangover or is just drunk to try this place outOk.  I know that everyone loves this place, locals and tourists alike, but honestly, I didn't think this place was anything spectacular.  I tried this place with my entire family awhile back and we ordered some chinese dishes which were alright (though the seafood items were a no go).  I came back recently because I wanted to give the pho noodle soup another try (I had forgotten what it tasted like).  Turns out, I forgot because it's nothing too memorable - not horrible, but not exactly mind blowing either.  

Here are the pros:  They have an extensive menu with pictures, and a variety of different dishes beyond what you see at your traditional pho place.

Their wings with special sauce were pretty delicious too. Sweet and slightly spicy.

It's pretty clean and looks pretty new. 

Here are the cons:
 If you're coming just for a regular pho special noodle soup, I'd say that it's decent here, but not great.  The one big gripe I had was that their pho special does not have tripe in it.  But if you're not a tripe fanatic like me, I guess it wouldn't matter to you.  

Also, I don't think they give as much meat in their pho noodle soups as other places - the pho special large was really not that large, and only had a few pieces of rare steak and brisket in it.Bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle) was delicious and so was the appetizer canh ga chien nuoc mam (fried chicken wings with fish sauce) - it tastes better than it sounds lol

The service was horrible though...The rumors are true: VEGAN PHO! yes, they have it; and it is GOOD! It's a very flavorful broth loaded with tons of veggies.  The only drawback is no protein! Now, some places go all crazy town with a million kinds of fake meat, which is really not necessary; but throw a sister a couple of tofu cubes at least! Still, I can't complain too much about a tasty huge bowl of goodness for only a few ducats.  I rounded out my food pyramid with some very tasty tofu nuggets.  Great late night spot (open 24 hrs) and perfect food to soak up the booze.This place is a godsend to people who just say PHO it after a night at marquee or xs. Its essentially open around the clock, the pho is pretty tasty, and the prices are very reasonable. I'm not usually in Vegas to have Vietnamese cuisine, but when I do, this place is it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because Cali spoils people on Viet cuisine  and this place isn't quite there yet in terms of taste. I'd give a 3.5 stars if I could though.I would give 3.5 stars if given the choice.  This place was packed 3am in the morning!  While the pho is fairly priced and tastes decent in Vegas, I cannot give it 4 or 5 stars due to the wondering choices I have tried in the Bay Area especially San Jose.  But, since there's not a whole lot of pho options in Vegas, this will have to do.This place is potent as fuck! 

You could smell the place from your car a mile away. Ok, yeah, that's just a mild exaggeration on my part, but whatever. You leave the place leaving with the smell of Pho on you, but then again, I love pho so that's really not a problem.

The food was great and came out quickly, which is the best thing after drinking and clubbing at 5am and walking around in the cold. 

If I have to be honest, the main reason why I even wanted to try the place was because of the name. I'd go anywhere where the name is a sexual pun...or if this was just a Vietnamese name and it was done without any bit of irony, then my apologies... Other wise, pho kim long? Yes please!Pho Kim Long has actually grown on me. At first I wasn't very impressed, but after trying a few different things I have kind of come around.

First of let me say that I work overnights, so when I get off at 5am my options are extremely limited. Pho Kim Long is probably the healthiest option if i want to eat out. The place is always clean but the service is lacking. Usually one person takes your order, another brings you the drink (a lot of the time after receiving food), another brings you the food.

The food always comes out in random order. Sometimes the Pho comes out first, sometimes the entrees. Sometimes it takes forever and sometimes its quick.

Because I've been there at least 20 times I've tried a lot on the menu, but not everything (the menu is extensive). 

The combination pho is good, it's not the best I've had but its consistently good. no complaints.

The spring rolls are fresh, but they are small. A lot smaller than any other place I've been.

Some of the entrees I've had we're just mediocre including Kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, curry chicken, and walnut shrimp. They weren't bad, just nothing stood out.

One dish that did stand out was the Honey garlic pork chops. I don't know if these are Vietnamese or Chinese or what, but they are some of the best food I've had at an asian restaurant. So tasty!

All in all, with the exception of slow service I don't have any major complaints for Pho Kim Long. I'll continue to go there, just usually late night because during the day I feel like there are better options.I'm a frequent visitor of Pho Kim Long but they're not normally my go-to spot. The convenience of being open 24 hours is typically what wins me over. 

I am deeply addicted to the eggs rolls. Those lettuce wrapped egg rolls do it in for me all the time! My girlfriend usually gets the pho. I'm not a fan of pho so this review is not for the pho alone. I've had the duck a few times here and it's a hit or miss. I'll either get all bone or all skin. 

The service is less than mediocre. You wait to be seated and the second you're seated you're rushed to put in your drink order. The second your drinks arrive they pressure you to put in your food order. It can get a tad uncomfortable.Im just A-OK about this place.

Props for it being open 24/7...and its a spot where my friends and I go to when were not sober...specifically around 4-6 AM in the morning. I can eat pho anytime...and pretty much everyday. I love pho & I love it even more when Im not sober. THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I KNOW whether its a guud pho place. Going intoxicated to a restaurant is similar to wearing beer goggles when checking out chicks. They all look/taste that much better. Coming to Pho Kim Long...yah i was intoxicated...so I should love the food even more right? For me, it was a No. I was satisfied (but not too satisfied), it was just A-OK, and I was starving like a hungry hippo.

Service was great though, but the food was just A-OK for me.

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^I am not sure if this place has come under new ownership, but my last outing here proved very disappointing. Up until recently, this place was my go to after hours food spot in Vegas. However this past time, I found myself unimpressed by the pho, which is surprising since the pho in LA is subpar for the most part. the spring roll also seemed haphazzardly prepared and lack any real flavor. It didn't help that the service was also terrible. VERY IMPORTANT: Call a cab when your entree arrives as there likely won't be one waiting for you between 4- 7 am. if you go to vegas and stay in chinatown, this does not apply to you.I'd give this place a 3.5 if yelp would let me. Food was good. I had the pork chop and rice. The ac was broken that night, so it was really warm and a little uncomfortable. The boba was decent. I had the honey dew boba. It was alright. I've had better though. The service was very good though.Went here for the first time with my family. Honestly the food was good, however we were seated by this group who was clearly outright drunk. For a family oriented restaurant, as soon as the drunk guy near us started to swear to his friend how he was going to "f**k his girlfriend and how he was going to tear her p***y apart"  tey should HAVE gotten kicked out. 

The servers were all very nice but they did NOTHING after several groups and tables complained about them. It got to the point where this drunk table started to splash and hit my family's table and at one point picked up his hot soup and splashed some on my dad's face.

As a restaurant, it is their job to protect their customers and this was not protecting my family and the others that were getting affected by this rowdy group.

Note: when five tables complain to you about a certain table, it's time to do something there, instead of going over to the table and watch them until they stop doing whatever they were doing and then repeat what they were doing when you're gone.

Customer service was just a joke.The crowd is majority after club crowd. They come in party clothes and at least semi drunk. 

Food is alright. I have to admit I didnt have their pho but some chinese dish like wonton soup (in vietnamese style) fried clams and somw vegetable dish. Its not memorable and particularly good. The clams are frozen clams that remained the froze taste. Dont think I will go back again.Open late for drunk feasting!  Each time I have gone, there was a wait, but it's not too bad. I have ordered the dat biet pho and the chicken pho.  They were both good.  Egg rolls were typical.excellent food, service was so slow today and they messed up my order. next table had same complaints. staff really odd, took off with my credit card for long time today... i hope i didnt become victim of fraud.  I dont recall service here being slow and rude, but it was definitely not fast or friendly.  Food amazing as before, but lost stars on service. I came around 5pm, saw no drunks or partiers.Descent place for PHO after a long weekend of partying in Vegas.

This is my go to spot on Sundays before leaving. 

This place is always packed! Parking is not difficult.First time here. The wait was not too bad. The hostess was super nice. But it seemed like the waiter took forever to come by and get our order. When he finally did come, he was obviously impatient and started tapping his foot. The food came out slower than anticipated for a pho place. Food was ok. Lettuce wraps were a little burnt. I may give it one more chance and order something different. Soups weren't anything spectacular. I'll stick to Pho So 1 for my pho fix.I was always here whenever I needed a pho fix and let me tell you.. I've experienced better. I was always here a lot when I was pregnant because it was the only thing that I craved for during the last two months of my pregnancy. 

The pho's pretty cheap. Around $7 a bowl AND they were pretty huge servings. That's probably the only good part about this restaurant. Other than that, the service was pretty slow on refills. It took them awhile to fill up my empty glass of water. Awhile as in.. A LONG WHILE. I had to ask the waitress THREE times for a refill. Their pho is mediocre. Nothing really amazing about it. 

Despite all of that, I'd still go and order.. I'll just probably bring my own bottle of water.It's connected to the Capital Seafood sitting in the 99 Ranch plaza.

Had the special of the day, satay noodles (soup w/ noodles) with shrimp.

It was just aite.. but we were craving Asian in Vegas so.. meh I probably wouldn't come back though.  Everything was laden with MSG.  It definitely had flavor.

The lady was bussing a neighboring table, and water splashed all over my feet. She got me some napkins.

They brought out the wrong order, beef instead of shrimp so had to flag down the waitress to bring me the right order.  Earlier I was trying to flag down the owner because none of the servers were around and he just waved back at me, as if my uncle was waving to me.  No uncle, I'm not waving hello, I'm asking for service please.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and you gotta be down with down-to-earth Viet food.Ok.  This has been our go to spot when we're in sin city.  Nothing that will blow your mind but it's good food at good prices.  Right in the heart of Chinatown.  Service is good and there's a chinese restaurant on the other side which makes it an unusual setup.  Two restaurants in one. The table next to us actually ordered food from both menus. Best of both worlds....chinese and vietnamese food in one spot. I only wish they had more than one egg noodle soup on the menu, but it was pretty good.I came here with my friend for dinner late at night. The service was meh. A lot of screaming and the bust girl was pretty much throwing dishes into her bin (very noisy). I ordered a veggie noodle bowl, which was actually quite good. My friend, however, couldn't even finish his dish because it was too salty. When he complained about it, the waitress told us they wouldn't charge for the meal since the cooks already went home and they couldn't bring him anything else. I don't know if the service was slacking because it was nearing the end of the day, but overall I give the restaurant 3 stars.On my way to Springs Preserve, I was about to stop off at Starbuck's for my caffeine fix. When I saw the sign for Einstein Bagels, I passed over Starbuck's.

  The fact that I passed over Starbuck's for Einstein Bagels is testimony that their coffee and value is better. For $2 more than Starbuck's, I brought bottomless coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Let me say that Einstein Bagel's Coffee is underrated. If I was to come up with a list of underrated places, Einstein Bagel's coffee would be on it. There were four blends of coffee, including Autumn Blend, Neighborhood blend, and decaf. I know that the  coffee is good when I pass over mixing in flavored syrup to add flavor to it. Regardless they fall short of the goodness of New York bagels, they come close. By the way, I recommend the toasted blueberry bagel.

    Whereas Einstein Bagels is a great value when you order a bagel with coffee, the value factor decreases when you order higher priced items. My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which I addressed in previous reviews, is not including a side item such as potato chips or potato salad with the sandwich. I believe that their customer base would grow if they included a side item.

   I have a mixed opinion as far as service. The employees were friendly at  the same time that it seemed understaffed. One employee juggling the order line and register line resulted in an extended line. Eventually the manager would help out at the order line. If I had an important place to be, it is strong possibility I would've walked over to Starbuck's.

   Because the lobby is large with lots of tables and windows, it is an inviting place to relax with a coffee and bagel. The noise level is average.

  I am not loyal to one bagel establishment. My mood will determine if I return to this location if I am in the vicinity of Decatur at Sahara.I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.

Rest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience.I was driving by this spot earlier this week, saw the word pupusas and cut across a couple traffic lanes...
Anyway, to get down to business I tried 3 different pupusas-the regular cheese one, a mixed one, and a pork one. They were all great and a little larger than the ones I have had before so definite bonus. The veggies they give you for the pupusas have a nice pickled flavor, you can tell that they took the time to do it right unlike other restaurants that just chop up cabbage and toss it in some sort of vinegar and claim it's pickled...I digress...

The atmosphere is somewhat typical, just a whole bunch of tables and chairs in one big open room. You don't order at a counter or anything, just sit down and enjoy. Worth a stop if you are in the area.
It seemed like a lot of the regular customers order a soup- I will head back to try that.Maybe it's because we dined @ this location about an hour before closing?

I've only eaten at one other Mac Grill, and that was back on the east coast.  The one in Harrisburg, PA (new location) rocks with outstanding service, fresh foods, and a clean/inviting atmosphere.

The location on Sahara in Vegas, has much to live up to!  Our server was a little on the untactful side.  He offered NO spices/herbs for the olive oil for our bread.  Those spices/herbs make a BIG difference!

I ordered a side salad before my meal.  The lettuce was old and wilted.  Our server did NOT offer any fresh grated pepper or cheese.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and was now offered fresh grated cheese but no pepper.  My meal was good but maybe a little overdone.

My boyfriend ordered the Mama's Trio.  His lasagna was clearly burnt and DRY!!!!  It looked like lasagna you get from a buffet.  I can't remember how the other two parts of his meal were but, clearly remember the less than desirable lasagna.

Overall, the service (at this location) was adequate but not great to any extreme.  The employees all seemed to be either grouchy or in their own worlds.  Like I mentioned before, the service we've received at OTHER Mac Grills has been excellent and the employees all seemed to make you feel welcome.

The restaurant was clean and comfortable.  

My experience at this location has kept me from revisiting any Mac Grill.  I love the food but am afraid to be disappointed again.  Kudos goes to the Harrisburg, PA Mac Grill for great food and great service!This was my 1st trip to #Landry's even though I have lived in the neighborhood for years!! Im just NOT a big seafood fan. But I heard word they had great steaks & burgers plus Happy Hour specials.Soooooo...

Here we are on a Wednesday night around 8pm -pretty light crowd but the place looks like its trying to hard to be  ritzy for a chain steak & seafood place-you know formal but jeans are ok.

There's a bar off to the side and a small lobster tank with 2 pathetic looking lobsters right as you enter the dining room. Boothes line the wall and small 4 chair table fill the room.

We were seated immediately in a booth and after about 10 minutes our waiter-#Jacob arrived to take our drink order. We went ahead and place our entire order since we were hungry & thirsty!!!

We decided to try their spin on a traditional app-Crab,Spinach& Artichoke dip and then the wife ordered the CRAB FEAST with a little of everything crab-Legs,Balls,Cakes and more. and I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye and Baked Potato.

The food came out alot faster than the 1st appearance-1st they brought a house salad with house dressing and the dip came out quick too.The dip was great-not fishy as I had feared but rather rich and creamy not unlike regular SPinach & artichoke dip. 

The main course was FANTASTIC!! One of the best under $50 steaks I've ever had(actually ONLY $22) cooked perfectly mediem-rare seasoned well and smooth like butter:) You could literally cut it with a SPOON:)

The crab was less than impressive. ONLY 2 crab legs for $40!!! WTF!~!!! The Fried Crab Balls were awful-too much cornmeal or whatever and no flavor. The crab cake the same and the Au Gratin Crab Meat was just whack-Where's the CRAB,huh? Definitely a better deal to get a STEAM POT at Joe's Crab Shack or the Krazy Buffet all-you-can-eat crab for $15.

I will definitely go back for a steak or $5 sliders at Happy Hour but as far as SEAFOOD goes I'll pass.I came here to have dinner for the first time and although I didn't dislike this place, I didn't love it either.

Food: 3/5 - Broiled stuffed shrimp with rice pilaf and literally two stalks of broccoli. My friends ordered all you can eat crab legs for $50 and they thought the crab was delicious; however, they were a bit soggy and hard to break. I ordered the Captain's Punch for $5 off the happy hour menu and it was pretty good and a plentiful drink for its price. Score. 

Service: 2.5/5 - Our waitress was nice and mostly attentive; however, she had to ask her manager twice if we were allowed to use the Yelp deal for free dessert, and then to see if my friend could use her concierge gift certificate. The Yelp deal situation was understandable, but when my friend also wanted to use his deal, she brought out the dessert AFTER she found out both deals wouldn't work in the same table. Then, she stated that the concierge gift certificate couldn't be used because she thought it was another offer. A gift certificate is not an offer, Lady. 

As for the dessert, save the calories. We ordered the bananas foster and creme brûlée. Both together receive a 3.5/5. The wrap used for the bananas foster was stale but the flavor was okay. The creme brûlée wasn't bad so I would recommend it.The food was very good, we had the planked salmon with a side of king crab and for appetizers we had calamari and crab with artichoke dip. The chairs are wood and not very comfortable to sit for a period of time.  But over all a great experience.3.0 stars.  

The bathroom was this slippery goooo... I was literally skating ... YUCK.

The pho on the other hand was pretty good.  The mexican waiter kinda takes away the whole experience of eating Vietnamese food and ordering in my native tongue.  The broth was good, and not too much msg.

Service could have been a bit better.  And the bathroom definitely needs help.  It could have had 0.5 to 1 more star if it wasn't for the bathroom debacle and the service.i went to this place based on a suggestion of a friend, who lives in the Vegas. The food is fine, they sit you fast, but my family had a table for 4 when we were a group of five...This place is good, cheap and fast.

If you are looking for good customer service and great ambiance then this place isn't for you.

If you are looking for a place to get your fix of good vietnamese food other than your standard Pho, then I would come here...and thats what we got... all 4 of us.

This is what we ordered
(1) 1 order of Cha Gio (Vietnamese Eggrolls)
(2) Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup w/ Pork feet)
(3) Banh Canh (Vietnamese Udon)
(4) Mi Xao Mem (Stir Fried Egg Noodles -- soft)
(5) Pho
(6) Thai Tea
(7) Vietnamese Coffee
(8) Sam Bo Luong

Like I said a good place for a variety of Vietnamese dishes. I don't have anything bad to comment on this restaurant. Gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the food is good but not mind blowing. In addition to the restaurant always being jammed packed.Pho So 1 is okay. The pho soup is good, but they don't give you enough meat. The spring rolls are a rip off. $4.00 dollars for 2 spring rolls is robbery! The pho is decent but Pho So 1 is raising its prices. Sometimes though Pho So 1 is hit or miss. Sometimes you get great pho, and sometimes you get what seems like leftover pho from the last night. The one great thing here is the Vietnamese BBQ . It's called (Bo-Nuong-Yi). If you are willing to spend like 30-40 dollars for each person to get full, the Vietnamese BBQ is the bomb!Stopped in on a weeknight, and this place was packed wall- to-wall....
According to lots of Yelpers, this is the spot for Pho, so of course I Get the Combination Pho, but I also gotta have a rice plate too, so I narrow it down to their roasted chicken plate or their grilled lemongrass chicken.

The waiter suggests the lemongrass chicken so I go with that. The wifey orders a Vermicelli bowl asking to substitute grilled chicken instead.

The Pho arrives first...Broth is clean and flavorful, noodles just right... overall, good dish. Lemongrass Chicken and Vermicelli Bowl arrive.
The Lemongrass Chicken obviously has been reheated and the vermicelli bowl has beef, instead of chicken.WTH????

One bite and I send the chicken plate back and ask to order something else...THE WAITER NEVER CAME BACK!

Wifey was hungry so she ate the beef in the vermicelli bowl...Just OK, nothing memorable. Pho KIm Long is still my go to spot with their combination Pho and Roasted Chicken with Seasoned Rice, a winning combination, IMO.....ALOHA!!!Pho is definitely good to eat when you're hungover. After a fun weekend in Vegas, we stopped by here before heading on home. The wait wasn't too bad that Sunday, but there was a bit of a lunch rush. I ordered the pho with the beef and brisket and it was pretty good. I know pho places can have their bad days (bland broth, salty broth, etc.). I've only been here twice and both times have been good so yayyy.Very solid Vietnamese food.  I enjoyed the iced coffee and rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp, egg rolls, and veggies.  This is the dish I get every time I go for Vietnamese.  My husband also enjoyed the pho ga (chicken pho soup).  Service is very prompt and generally friendly.Maybe I was sober when I went here. I had better pho than this. The broth was very bland, not flavorful enough. There wasn't any " nuoc beo" The owner was very nice however. Maybe, I will try it again when I am drunk.Heard this is some of the best local phó in vegas. 

Its location was in a not to crowded place plenty of parking unlike the rest of the phó places down the street in the little saigon shopping center.

upon entering the restaurant the smell phó broth and marinated beef hit you. The sound of clattering plates and glass cups chattering fills your ears. A sign of a good restaurant if you ask me. 

I ordered the pho dac biet with added meatball. The soup came less than 10 mins. Deff a good bowl of pho, i have no complaints.Not bad place to go get some pho. I've tried better since I live in San Jose. 

Pros: plenty of parking, nice servers

Cons: Food taste ok. 

I still would come back to try it again next time...To say this is the best pho place in Vegas, is sad. It used to be decent, but I ask you to try it out and see for yourself.

SETTING: Located in the same plaza as market 168 and Honey Pig, it has a fair amount of parking. Be careful on the weekends when it's super crowded and everyone's a crappy driver. Restaurant is open, spacious. Seats and tables are gross and sometimes sticky. 

Might be a bit of a wait depending on the time and day. Fridays, saturdays, all major holidays are pretty packed. 

SERVICE: Hit-or-miss normally. Late-nights are good from 8pm-ish onwards when it's got a good crowd going, but they're still attentive. 

Can be very annoying trying to grab their attention. Like some asian places, don't expect them to pander, smile, or be fluffy with you. Cultural thing? Slightly. In vietnam, it's normally very business-like in the sense that you go eat and get out. You've got places to be. Casual. Still respectful though. Nothing personal. 

Am I the ONLY one that finds it bizarre that they serve hot tea in regular-size beverage cups?! Where are my teacups and teapot?! Not a huge deal, but it's comical to me. 

FOOD: one issue I've had consistently with the place for several years is the temperature of the broth. They either serve it slightly warm or barely hot. You might think this isn't an issue. Good pho is HOT (still shy of boiling hot) throughout the whole time you eat it and doesn't grow cold when you're almost or halfway finished. It also serves to cook your thin meat slices in there. I can't tell you how many times my pho has come out barely warm.

If your pho comes out tongue-ready without having to blow on it (sorry, couldn't word that any differently :/ ), then they're doing it WRONG. Ruins the experience.

Broth is normally flavorful for me, but nothing spectacular like "OH MY GOSH this is UH-MAZE-ING." I like to eat it as-is before manipulating it with hoisin and hot sauce. Whenever it is packed here, the food suffers. It's a pretty huge difference. Meat is fine, but I've found it oddly too tough sometimes. Hu tieu mi is one of my fave noodle soups, and they do a decent version of it. However, they LOAD so much into a bowl that it spills when I put my spoon and chopsticks in.

Would I call this perfect or even the best pho in Vegas? No. It's mediocre bordering on okay, but I'm happy this place has some awesome love for it. I'd rather stay at home and make my own, honestly. Am I being elitist about this? Maybe. I've just had decent or excellent pho since I was kid to know the difference in quality.

PROS: open late nights for the bar/club crowd and night owls. Okay pho, but seriously overrated. Good portions for both small and large bowls.

CONS: service. The food. 

VERDICT: Okay food for the price. Affordable. Great option for when you're craving food to soak up all that alcohol late nights. If you're not super picky or don't care, it's an okay place to go. Far from the best, but still better than the worst.Wow, such bad reviews for this place?  I ate here a few times with my gf and everything seemed fine.  Their tap water was actually palatable considering it's Vegas.  They must filter it or something.  I guess I won't be back if those health violations posted by BK are true.I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and it is an all you can eat dine in restaurant but only on the left side. The prices range between $15-18 for the all you can eat. They do not have a menu on this side, they basically just have a list of the meats you can choose from and it is unlimited including the sides. I give the food four-stars, as the food is delicious. I love Korean food and sides! However, I need to give the service three-stars. 

The first time I went there it was around 5pm, there was no line and we were seated fairly quickly. We had a lady serving us and she was nice but very hard to flag down. I enjoyed the food there especially the brisket and the sides. I was just not impressed by the service. 

The second time we went there, we decided to go to dinner and we brought our friend with us. I made sure to arrive early to get us seats. The all you can eat side was pretty full so I stood by the sign that says, "wait to be seated". No one was behind me at the time so I did not mind waiting. However, another person arrived and spoke to one of the servers. He decided to seat them first which I'm sure would upset a few people. I spoke to him before he seated them and explained that I was clearly standing there first and he should not have sat them before me as I was waiting and was not with their party. My friends arrived soon after he seated that party of three I was not too happy about that. I had a good time otherwise, but I just feel that in order to get more people into the place, the service has to be just as good as the food. If you don't mind good food, but lousy service, you should try this place.As one of the late night options for Korean near work, Tofu Hut is not a shabby option. Is it my favorite for soon dubu? No, but their kalbi is rather delicious. A group of us came in to grab a bite after work. We did not feel like doing all you can eat, so we ordered off the menu.

Japchae- glass noodles with beef and vegetables used too much soy sauce. Normally they are lightly colored by the dark sauce and has a complimentary taste of sesame oil, but this one was predominately soy sauce. I didn't eat more than a few bites of it.

Mixed beef and seafood soon dubu had plenty of seafood and beef pieces. The abundance of soft tofu made the dish enjoyable, but it lacked flavor. Same could be said about the mushroom pot.

Bulgogi- thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce and sugar sauce with vegetables. This dish was on the sweet side. Combined with the kimchi, it balanced out, but too much on it's own.

Kalbi- soy sauce based marinated beef short ribs. These are the best! It was so good, that we ordered another plate. The flavor was balanced and the meat was so tender. I could pull the meat right off the bone without much resistance. It definitely was the saving grace of the meal.I come here for the AYCE KBBQ. The meat here is better than most KBBQ place in Vegas for almost half the price.  They don't have much of a side order selection but the salad and the sides that come with the meal is good.  The only problem is that half the restaurant is for KBBQ so seating is very limited and it can take very long to get a table when it's busy.  The service is decent.  A server will come around now and then and ask if you want to order more but its hard to get their attention when they are  running around.Tofu Hut... we have a love hate relationship.

Service is AWESOME most of the time but sometimes i feel like they forgot i was there.

Meat quality isnt the best but for its price you cant really ask more.

We always get the AYCE. Just brisket and pork belly. because everything else is meh... 
and dont even talk about the squid...i thought i was going to be seasoned...its not...they throw it on a plate and just give it to you...really?.... wow.. lol

idk how or why i alway6s end up here but like i said.. its a love hate realtinshui[ lolCame here for all you can eat Korean BBQ and we were not too impressed.

The location is in the Chinatown area off of Spring Mountain. Parking lot is on the side of the restaurant and there is amble spaces.

The restaurant itself was not busy when we arrived but it was when we left. I don't think this location is worth a wait for Korean BBQ due to not enough tables with a grill and service lacked.

Came here with a group of three. Prices were typical for all you can eat.

They do not have teriyaki sauce
They do not have any iced tea.

The meats were marinated pretty good and decent quality too.

Service was not the best for us.

This was our first visit here and I think we will be trying different Korean BBQ restaurants before we come back to this place again.This Walmart on the weekends in the afternoon gets very busy and the cashiers are very slow and with no self check outs it makes for a long wait. Overall it's a decent WalmartLARGE WAR WON TON SOUP TO GO PLEASE!

jam packed with pork, beef, veggies, chicken and shrimp!

this review is for the WAR WON TON SOUP only!

don't waste your time trying anything else as is mediocre, but they have a bomb war won ton soup in my opinion!

call in ahead otherwise you will be sitting and waiting a good 20 minutes while they make it. 

enjoy.My nails were chipping from too much dice throwing during the week, and since vegas sucks up my money all the time, I was looking for a quick and cheap manicure to do some repair before I headed back. This was the first place that popped up on yelp, and I headed over for the reviewed $10 manicure. 

First of all, the price was raised to $12 for a manicure now. Secondly, I feel like non-manhattan salons do not carry Essie. I've only visited 2 so far, but nobody has Essie which is my go to. I'm ok with OPI, which is a staple but its sad that they didn't have essie. 

The lady that worked on my manicure was fine. She used a buffering machine thing, which is new for me. I've never had that type of treatment before. The manicure was fine, my nails lasted about a week or 1.5 weeks. 

The establishment itself didn't feel very chic or anything, but its fine for a quick manicure. It's a nail salon and a hair salon together. Most of the workers are vietnamese, and theres one haircutting lady that's chinese. They're not too chatty which is what I like; I tend to zone out when I'm getting a manicure. and they're friendly and nice. It's located in the middle of a small shopping plaza near this large asian super market, which was convenient. 

I recommend this place if you're visiting vegas and you need a quick fix.Went with my sister to get mani and pedi with french tip. Pricing wasn't too bad ($12 for pedi, $23 for mani and then some more for french tip), but we've gotten better for the same amount paid. 

If you're a hygiene freak then don't go here. They re-used their gloves when they do people's feet and when you walk in it smells strongly of a nail salon.Very helpful and friendly staff.It's always good to have an alternative to Subway and Quiznos.  Even though we have Port of Subs here in Vegas, it's still a very sterile place.  Jimmy John's is finally a chain sandwich shop with some personality.

The menu has a mix of specialty and plain sandwiches.  Sub style or club style.  I went with the turkey breast "plain slim" with cheese.  This is great for me because "plain slims" are just bread and meat.  I know that makes me incredibly weird, but that's how I like my cold sandwiches.  One downfall of this place is the lack of bread selection.  Just plain french.

I asked one of the workers what the most popular sandwiches are.  She said the #9 (Italian Night Club) and #12 (Beach Club).  There is some seating, though not a lot.  You can order online and check out the catering specials.  If I'm in the area I'd check this place out again.Came for an event and was impressed by some dishes but ultimately let down by the one thing I actually ordered. Because I'm lazy I'm gonna make it quick. Get the fried saimin. It's really good. I'd go for some right now if i was near there. Don't get the lau lau. It sucks. Sort of dry and bland.I visited Aloha Kitchen for the first time yesterday. This was a place that my co-workers ordered from a lot since it's in close distance from our workplace.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki and a side order of spam musubi. I enjoyed both but my only gripe is that the chicken teriyaki didn't come with vegetables. I don't know, maybe I always expected any chicken teriyaki plate to be mixed with vegetables?  Either way, it was still good. Would I try it again? Sure. There was some other things on the menu that caught my interest.Much better customer service @ the other locations.I thought the food was fairly authentic but it wasn't great. The outside and inside of the place was kinda dingy but I care more about how the food tastes than what the place looks like. This is the kinda place I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars to if I stopped by at 3am after hanging out all night but such was not the case on this visit. If you've even been to Taco Cabana in Texas, this is similar but more authentic mexican food.The samosas were good. Chicken and prawn tikka masala had some flavor to it. The Naan was just heavenly. Indian food is the type of food that you eat when you are in the mood. The service is OK. They also have a lunch buffet. However, the prices for dinner menu can get a bit expensive.Lunch buffet: of all vegetarian dishes, all but saag paneer were tasteless. Naan was very good though, fresh and plentiful.A standard Japanese restaurant located in a small strip mall off of W. Charleston Boulevard.  A tiny sushi bar occupies the corner along with a flat screen TV.  With only one waitress and one sushi chef on a Friday night, they can easily handle the light crowd on a Friday night.

Upon seating and getting our drink orders, the waitress automatically brings out miso soup.  A nice treat as you peruse the menu.  For dinner, I chose the Nozomi's Combination Dinner of three items.  For $16.95, I got tempura, pork katsu, and fried scallop.  Rice, a side salad, sunomono, and pickled daikon accompanied my order.  The BF went for the same - but his choices were the grilled saba, pork katsu, and the chicken katsu.  We were both impressed with the hearty amount of the food we got and both had leftovers to bring home surprisingly enough.  The fried scallops were juicy buggers, and some on the big side too!  (Other choices for the combination include chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, vegetable tempura, and fried oyster.)

Their menu not only includes your basic Japanese fare and sushi rolls, but also their Steak Joshua ($14.95) - "New York steak seasoned with Hawaiian rock salt and grilled in garlic butter" and their famous Chuckster Salad ($9.95 sm; $13.95 lg) - "Assorted chunks of sashimi, sweet cucumbers, and daikon topped with tempura flakes and special sauce".

They do offer all you can eat sushi for $25.99/pp as well.

Service was good, simple and efficient.  I got the impression they had regulars there from the way they didn't have to look at the menu to put their order in.  We expect to return again for a satisfying meal.

(I uploaded our dinner pics in the business profile!)Great place for lunch little slow on the service side but the food is consistent quality and very good. Crunch roll and the mackerel were my favorite the seaweed salad is good too but you can't mess that one up. The box meals are pretty standard. 
The sashimi is good quality and good size portions the best was the salmon hand rollMy BFF Lily and I ventured here based on the reviews she had read about the spot and I was intrigued by the talks of lobster. The interior definitely didn't make a good first impression; it's old, dim, dingy, and the chairs were a bit uncomfortable. There are a lot of options on the menu, however, there were few things that really caught my eye. Of course we had to order the famous lobster omelet with Josephina cheese, served with potato cakes. It really didn't wow me. The sauce was good, perhaps more suitable for something else, but it wasn't memorable. The potato cakes were good; fancy name for fast food-style hash browns. We also ordered the ribeye with eggs and their house potatoes. The meat was cooked nicely and the potatoes were good. Again, nothing spectacular though. The service was nice and overall experience was okay. I was expecting a little more because of the hype around their lobster breakfasts, so the mediocre meal was disappointing.i went there because of tours.

the guide gave me one of the hotel's courtyard's rooms, 

it was near the freeway, so it was so noisy when i stayed at the room

it was dirty except the exception desks; otherwise, trashes were everywhere.

the room was a basic and standard 2-bed room, i like the shower

one star is for the low rate.
a second star is for the bathroom
a third star is ...... oh yea, it is a 3-star hotel.I attended a conference here.  My room was in the motel part of the hotel.  Had to go outside to get to the motel.  As soon as I got into my room, I saw a bug. WTF!! So, I had the heebeejeebees all night.
The casino area is congested.  The staff there is hohum.
The only redeeming quality for this place is the OYSTER BAR!! They prepare the best seafood gumbo I have ever had.  As a matter of fact, I go to Las Vegas at twice yearly.  Each time, I cab it to the Palace Station for the OYSTER BAR!  You got to check it out!!
The second night in the hotel, I saw another bug... same bathroom, different specie of insect. YUCK!I was attending a convention and the room was was affordable. I stayed in the courtyard and although the rooms are not up-to-date like the Tower Rooms. It was cozy, comfortable, and clean. We were close to the gym and the pool. Nothing luxurious but suit it's purpose. I did get to see the Tower Rooms and they are up to date and not that much more than the courtyard rooms. 

We also ate at the buffet and the food was good and they had a variety of food available including seafood, salads, prime rib (very good), mexican, Italian, etc... The cost of the buffet was affordable except for Friday night, but it was Seafood Night. 

We had breakfast at Coco's Bakery, conveniently located in the casino. The breakfast was very good (Breakfast Special included: pancakes, sausage or bacon, hash browns or hash rounds, and eggs $3.99) and prices were affordable. 

The location was good on the other side of the strip, we were able to get there in 5 min. (just had to find parking). 

So, if you are going to Las Vegas and need an affordable place to stay, the Palace Casino suits the bill.This casino isn't one of my favorites. It's just a little off the strip and it does have one $5 paigow table. I usually like to just sit and enjoy playing a few hands while enjoying a nice cold corona. Thing is, if this $5 table is full, not much I can really do but sit around and wait. This casino doesn't have paigow insurance either and I usually like to play that as my hands are always bad.

Anyways this casino is also a bit small, but OK looking. Still seems a bit old fashioned and I'm not to much of a fan of old fashioned looking casinos. We did come here a few times with no disappointment to me. Besides them taking my money (which all casinos do) it was still a pleasurable experience. But I'd much rather play at another casino. I can't really rate about how nice and clean their rooms are as I've never even stayed here, but just based on my few times here it only deserves and OK rating.We stayed here for the night for the wife's Birthday. Which is decent place to stay. It wouldn't be my first choice, if I was ever to have a stay-cation but it is a nice place. It has a nice look on the outside, as well as inside. 

Located off the freeway and Sahara, Palace station is one of many Station Casinos surrounding Las Vegas. Upon arriving, it was a bit confusing cause we weren't sure where the garage was or if they had one. But we did find it in the back after a confusing way to get there. 

Upon check in, it wasn't busy as I thought it would be at 3pm. Then again it was on a weekday, so it wasn't as busy. We did get a petite suite, which was kind of nice, till we walked around. It was roomy, and the color scheme seems nice. I did like the window view, which goes out a little like a half cylinder. What I didn't like was the the desk and Internet connection was no where near each other. The Internet connection is on one side of the room, next to the big TV, but the desk is on the opposite side. Unfortunately the connection and wire length of both Internet and my computer isn't long enough to make it to the desk. In other words, we used our bed as the laptops platform. Other than that, I did like the bed and the petite suite was roomy. A decent place to stay in. 

After settling in our room, we decided to go to Broilers steak house. I have a thing for steaks, and we have been here before. First time around seems good, but this time around, wasn't as satisfying as the first. I notice they did change a little bit but still same menu. As usual, I had my prawns. They were very good to start with. The fillet Mignon was a bit unsatisfactory. Even though I did order it medium, it was a more on the red side. I still ate it, but wasn't as happy as the first. 

We did go gambling, and I prefer craps to gamble. The dealers were not as social or entertaining at first. But once you start betting for them, they come alive and become more sociable. As for me, I'm more of a person who feels comfortable to go on a craps table. But having dealers not interacting as much on craps, seems a bit intimidating to try it. But after a while, they come around in a way. Even though I did lose my money, it was kind of fun in the end. 

After a goodnight sleep, we went to Grand Cafe for breakfast. Even though the waitress was friendly, wasn't really happy with the fact of her assumption, that the wife is speaking for the both of us. The wife wanted coffee so the waitress assume that I wanted coffee and poured me a cup. I'm not a coffee person, cause I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have dairy or cream in my system. But drank it anyways. since its already poured and didn't want to let it waste. I was able to order a breakfast skillet, which was decent. Even though, I know it was morning, and it wasn't as busy. So I wasn't sure why the waitress was taking her time in the back, when waiting for a refill 

Overall, Palace station is a decent place to lay your head. Gambling wise, don't expect much when it comes to interacting. Not unless you do something first. Food wise, it was decent and edible. Grand Cafe has its ups and downs, but an "OK" rating.As expected, this place serves its purpose. You can sleep here, eat here, shower here, do your business here, etc.  But there is no 'ooh ahhs' that come along with it at all. We stayed here three nights over MDW. We were in the courtyard rooms. As we got lost after becoming a victim to the wind tunnel that was the open alley in between the hotel and the courtyard rooms, we found ourselves wandering the floors looking for our rooms. And we realized that there was no elevator so I grunted at the thought of carrying one of my bags up the stairs. A bell man offered to help me but as soon as I reached the top, I said thank you, not needing his services. Apparently, no handicap people stay on the second floor of the courtyard.

We finally found our room after being in a maze and stepped into a room with two full/queen size beds, a desk, tv that swivels, a window, AC and bathroom with a single shower and a shower curtain. The bed closest to the door was not comfortable at all. Springs would pop right back up with authority as you moved. The other bed was much more manageable. We needed to then take a nap and realized there wasn't a comforter on the bed or in the stand alone closet. I think I was asleep for 20 minutes before a blanket was brought up. They said there is a blanket in between the sheets. It was as thin as could be. No fluff here!

At night the walls are so thin that you can hear obnoxious people arguing, which I'd prefer over the joyous screams of one of Vegas' so-called hourly finest. The blow dryer didn't work after resetting it and replugging it. And to top it off, there is a mandatory $16/night charge for their amenities. Which the hubby said it wasn't disclosed to him or his buddies that were also staying there. I did use their gym for one day. It had treadmills, stair climbers, bikes, one bench and dumbells. I eventually found the side entrance to the courtyard to avoid the wind tunnel and I got to my room quicker. But the sign on the outside that says you need to have your key to enter was false. Anyone can come in thru that door. Yay, safety! But I didn't find any bugs or anything incredibly disgusting in the room, so I'm thankful for that.

I did want to try the oyster bar but I chose to spend my money elsewhere in terms of consumables. Like I said, the Palace Station served its purpose.I named my own price on priceline and got palace station. I booked it one week in advance. I bidded 37. It came out to 48.80 + 16.79 resort fee for one night. Saturday night.

- Palace Perks comes with up to $25 match play. nice!
- Flat wide screen! great amenity. 
- Gym and pool in the courtyard. Gym 6am - 12am. Pool 6am - 10pm
- No fridge. Walk and get the ice. :/
- Wireless fail. Had to call room service and the only solution was to go to the room next door to ours and reset their wi-fi so we can use theirs. It took hours.
- Understanding. Waived resort fee bc of wireless fail. 
- Thin walls. loud black folks next door. haha. 
- Usually 1 roulette going. 5 bucks. not bad. no martingale. F that.
- condom near elevator. ghetto. 
- Must have a Station card or you when get good perks.
- Come if you want a cheap stay and fine with kinks here and there.Room was very clean and nice. However be careful with hidden fees: $16.00 extra when you check in.I stay here a lot because of the price, and the location is fairly central. Whatever you do, do NOT stay in the cheapest rooms, the "courtyard" rooms. They are in the old motel building and are TERRIBLE and very unsafe. Upgrade to a tower room. 

They have gone through multiple owners and the ups and downs associated with that. There is a daily resort fee, which covers the crappy wifi. Parking is free and plentiful. There used to be a free shuttle to the strip but that appears to be gone, along with the free airport shuttle. Too bad, they were nice perks, and made the off-strip location more usable. 

The rooms vary drastically. Sometimes they are nice and clean, others are beat. It's kind of a crapshoot.4 stars for the service.
4 stars for food presentation.
3 stars for taste (Udon was a tad too bland)
3 and a 1/2 stars for atmosphere.

Extremely meduim overall.There's a certain type of Japanese restaurant where most of the food is small cooked dishes for reasonable prices and the menu is mostly on the wall. This is the kind of place a businessman would go to after work to drink with his co-workers, and snack while they discuss whatever. This isn't a go-to place for sushi. This isn't a formal romantic evening. You're not paying for the posh atmosphere.

Everything is well prepared, the menu (both on paper and additional items on the walls) are varied and incorporate traditional dishes and contemporary food as well. Price was very very low, and the place is packed even in the middle of the week, so arrive early or plan to wait (dunno if they have reservations.)

Personal recommendations would be the chicken gizzards, wasabi octopus, shishito skewers, and my absolute favorite would be the honey toast box is a must try too!

If you're looking for japanese food, come here. If you're looking for some good eats with a little sushi, come here. If you want a full blown 7-course sushi meal with lots of nigiri, this might not be the place for you.A large amount of good reviews for this place, but we walked away questioning what was great about it.  This place isn't bad, but isn't a 4-star in my books.  They have a variety of food though, I'll definitely give that to them, I mean tons.  They have items to choose from all over their walls.  Also, items are cheap and you really cannot complain about the prices here.

I almost want to think of this place as small dishes, well sort of.  I recommend a bunch of people go so you can try the tons of dishes they offer.  The most memorable dish here was sliced pork belly, stir-fried with kimchi and sitting on a bed of shredded cabbage.  This was an excellent dish.  Pork had good amounts of fat on it, thinly sliced, and had a nice spice kick to your palette as well.  We also ordered the miso ramen which was decent, not the greatest.  To me, it was lacking a little flavor in the broth, but for $9.80, it's a huge bowl.  The noodles were good though and tons of other "filler" items going on, not to mention a tender piece of pork. I decided to try two skewers, beef tongue and jumbo chicken wings.  The beef tongue was good, couldn't complain.  However, their so-called jumbo wings were not jumbo and lacked flavor.  I was eating a plain grilled dinky chicken wing, I didn't even bother with the second one.  Also ordered the chicken-katsu which was heavily battered and crispy, but came out a tad dry, should have got the pork.  The last two items were ordinary and I was also not expecting much.  California roll and their salmon sashimi.  I have to say their salmon was fresh though, so don't hesitate here if you want to order this.  Oh, one last thing was the mochi ice cream, red bean all the way.

This place opened at 5:00 and was packed!  It's not a large place, maybe sits like 40 people.  We get here at 5:05 and it's half-full already, I don't understand.  Were people lined up outside?  With this, service wasn't there at all.  We had to pull our waitress over a few times to get their attention to order, refill our mugs with tea, etc.   It's almost they got slammed by customers and couldn't keep up.  The food service came out item-by-item, which was fine.  Towards the end of our meal though, I noticed a third waitress show up.  Overall, a decent place to get away from "strip" food and spend less money.  If you like variety, go here as again, tons to choose from.  Plus, it's not far at all, less than 10 mins from the Wynn, if that.This is the kind of place you almost want to keep secret (I know, I know, that's sacrelige in yelpland) but now that the word is definitely out, I might as well throw my generalized two cents in:

Like Raku down the street, Ichiza is the kind of place you'd never expect to find in Vegas...and generally filled with the kind of people (young Asians) you'd be surprised to find here in plentitude. If it isn't "authentic," it certainly feels that way--on the second floor of a post-trendy strip mall with little else to attract you (though Zizzy karaoke bar downstairs has its charms). 

Yes, there is a general standard sushi--ramen-robotayaki menu here, but that isn't what you should come for. What you should come for are the random daily specials that are posted on pieces of paper all over the walls, which could be...just about anything edible! Come to experiment, come to be daring, come to have fun. Service is friendly, by cute Japanese girls, though it's not necessarily helpful. I wouldn't necessarily recommend those with food allergies take their chances here.

And finish with the decadent honey toast dessert, big enough for...two? four? six!Mochi wrapped in bacon? Asparagus wrapped in bacon?! Salmon mozzarella tempura, oh my!

This place has a lot of food that boggles your mind. Be adventurous and order off the items on the wall. This is the kind of stuff you see on Iron Chef. BUT, execution of many the dishes are far from Iron Chef caliber.

Our group ordered a lot and I still don't remember everything I ate.

* Deep Fried Prawns - The prawns are not the jumbo shrimp that many people are use to, but the small size everyone refers to as shrimp. Even then it wasn't deep fried enough where you can eat the entire shrimp as a whole, which left a bitter a taste because you can still taste the shell. We had a couple of pieces left over, which is a sin for our group to waste seafood! I guess it was just that bad.

* Eggplant - I don't like eggplant, this dish reinforces that idea. It just came out what look like something you serve prisoners. Regardless, tried it and it wasn't good. Everyone, except one person like the dish, explaining it could have been served warmer, instead of lukewarm.

* Mochi wrapped in Bacon - Bacon has a very salty taste and mochi has a weaker sweet taste. Combine both, and you get bacon taste. Really thats all there is to this, sure you get the chewy mochi texture, but the bacon just overpowers it. I might as well get a bacon skewer wrapped in bacon.

* Salmon Mozzarella Tempura - We ordered this at the beginning of the meal, but didn't get it till almost the end of our meal. Great combo, but poor execution. Mozzarella or any cheese for that matter should be really melted and served as hot as possible. Thats why nachos, pizza, and burgers all have melted cheese because it just tastes better! The mozzarella tempura came to us lukewarm and almost cold. Just properly heating up the mozzarella could have made this dish a winner, but just became another forgotten dish. 

* Oysters w/ garlic butter sauce - Oysters was good, but felt the garlic butter sauce drowned the flavors of oysters. Maybe a little bit less garlic and a more watered down butter sauce would do it. 

* Salmon something w/ Salmon Caviar - This is a zensai or Japanese hors d'oeuvres. I believe it was salmon, but I could be wrong.  The caviar (fish eggs), just overpowered the rest of the zensai. Get the tar tar yellow tail instead.

* Pork w/ eggs and ?? - I forgot what this was exactly, but the first time we ordered it, our pork was tough and dry. But ordering it for round 2 there is a world of difference. This bothers me a little when they can't deliver food consistently good.

* Pork steaks with onions - The opposite happen with this one, it was good the first time we got it, and not so good the second time. First time it was cooked properly preserving the juices of the pork, but second time resulted in a more dry pork steak that didn't really have much flavor.

* Wasabi Squid / Octupus - I don't like squid and octupus, but did give this a try. It was supringsly very refreshing. I thought I would get the kick from the wasabi, but I got a refreshing cool taste instead. I still wouldn't eat it again, but I'm sure those who love squid or octupus will love this dish.

* Gyoza - Served hot for us. Very tasty and delicious. 

* Artichoke or Asparagus wrapped in Bacon - Wrap anything in bacon, and it'll probably taste good. This waste the case. Look mom, I'm eating my veggies... wrapped in BACON! 

* Beef Liver with bean sprouts and green onion - I don't really like eating liver, but this was one of the dishes that was executed very well.   It was very tender all the way through, and the bean sprouts and green onion just help balance the flavors of the liver.

* Beef Carpaccio - Clean refreshing taste, that does a good job of balancing the strong beef flavors.

* Black cod - Very flavorful and just cooked properly all the way through. This was reminiscent of the awesome sea bass at HK star.

* Tar Tar Yellow Tail - Its just so hard for me to describe this, just order it, its good! You get 4 of them per order.

* Honey Toast w/ Ice Cream - 5 pieces of honey bread toasted together, and the center burrowed out to fit the Vanilla ice cream. Simple, but awesome. We originally were given plastic utensils trying to divide it in our group, but that failed. Another waitress saw this fail, and gave us some metal utensils to slay the honey toasted dragon. It would have been nice if the first waitress gave us metal utensils to begin with. 

Phew that was a long list, there was more but I really can't remember them all. The wait staff was very friendly and refilled our drinks in a timely manner without asking. Other than the mishap with the Salmon Mozzarella Tempura and the plastic utensils, no complaints. The back of the house could use some work though, needing to deliver food consistently good and refine some items.

Ichiza is a cool hangout to try Japanese Izakaya food, but there are a couple of land mines along the way as you try to find the gems. Don't get blown up!Went there on a Tuesday night. It was busy but no wait for counter seating. The place is a hole in the wall and doesn't feel clean. We ordered the crab fried rice, salmon skin salad, grilled squid, mountain yam with seaweed salad, and a variety of Yakitori including beef tongue. Nothing really stood out. Our neighbor ordered a yellowtail sashimi which actually looked better than all our dishes. The most tasteless were the Yakitori/skewers. No special sauces thus quite bland. The best dish was the grilled squid. Left rather unsatisfied.I literally spend 10 minutes making fun of the old man that runs this place, and then when I turned around he was standing right there. He was really pissed. 

The average wait time here is 40 minutes. 

I don't get this place. Tourist from Japan always ask me how to get here. Apparently, even in Japan they advertise this place. 

It smelled horrible in here today. The smell was a combination of ammonia and paint. Apparently the construction in the shop next door is causing this horrible stench. 

To me, "Anime Ramen" downstairs has a way better tasting Honey Toast. The Honey Toast here at ICHIZA is presented artistically and impressively, but it just doesn't have the impressive taste like the one at "Anime". At "Anime", they batter and fry the pieces of toast and give you a scoop of ice cream they intentionally over froze, so that it doesn't melt immediately on the hot bread. I also like how at "Anime", they use a real Japanese brand of ice cream instead of some generic super market brand. 

Personally, I didn't really like anything here. I'm just giving it 3-stars because I feel bad about pissing off the old man.Went very late night, and for late night food it was pretty good, however I didn't enjoy it half as much as I enjoy most places in the area that are only open at more regular times. I will say the honey toast dessert was gigantic and incredibleSolid 3 1/2 stars.  Sashimi was super fresh.  All the cooked foods were not bad either.Came here recently and just wanted to update that their beef bowl has gotten a little yucky. Still won't stop me from coming here though!I like to eat  at  here  food  is  assume  and  great i came here  for  7 yrs  now  but  i alway  think  kitchen is  so  dirty lol
This is  problems i can not give higher stars . I have  6 and half yrs of experience being  chef so  i can  see  that  dirty kitchen...Came for a quick and light dinner.

Good:
Stir fried garlic chicken gizzard.

OK:
Black Cod

Not so much:
Spicy deep fried chicken soft bone was bland.
Beef tongue was over salted.

Sorry, LV.  LA has you beat.
I do want to come back and try more stuff. 
So, we'll see......This place is ok, as my rating says. I come here for the lemon horns. They run out relatively quickly so get here early. The pastry is flaky and the filling is just as a lemon filling should taste - sweet yet acidic. The cakes are ok but not too impressive. They had a recent renovation which seemed useless. I'm sure there are better in Chinatown. The only reason this one is frequented so often is because of its location next to the 99 Ranch Market.Love this place, always get my steamed buns from here-BBQ Pork. Have always a friendly attitude and always have a great cake selection...

Only reason that they get a couple stars knocked down is that they have the "minimum of $10 purchase with credit/debit card"... I mean come on... sometimes I just want a steamed bun and don't have cash...makes me visit them less... doesn't make them any less delicious though.The food here was surprisingly good, given all the negative reviews. But that is where the goodness ends. Service and prices are piss poor. The waiter looked like he was ready to jump off a bridge. Service with a frown. Every menu item was over $10, even the stir fried chinese spinach. I can understand paying up for an upscale chinese eatery, but this place ain't even close.

Cash only is ridiculous given the high prices. But then again this is Vegas, where cash is king.Sam Woo is practically a household name in Southern California, much like Panda Express would be in most cities.  There are dozens of them all over Southern California, from Monterey Park to Orange County.  I used to go to the one in Irvine quite often, and loved that they had "on-demand" Peking Duck.  Most Chinese restaurants make you order it 24 hours ahead of time, but here you can get it whenever you want.  Some of the Sam Woo's are BBQ, some are seafood, but all of them serve traditional Hong Kong style Chinese food.  

The Sam Woo in Las Vegas is a BBQ restaurant, which means they have the Peking Duck on-demand.  This is my favorite part about this Sam Woo. They also have a lot of other BBQ items, such as BBQ spare rib and Chickens.  These can be either bought at the sit-down restaurant, or at the counter at the front of the restaurant.  

The restaurant is always pretty busy, but they handle the crowd well, and always have room for new tables.  I really enjoy their Hong Kong style crispy noodles, and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I also like the Pork Chop with Salt & Pepper.  

The reason I give Sam Woo's in Las Vegas a 3-star review is because it does not live up to the hype of the southern California restaurants.  I have found that the one out here in Las Vegas is hit or miss, having had very mediocre food on several occasions, while also having the typical great Sam Woo cuisine on severl other occasions.  This is what left me at 3 stars.  If they were consistent, it would be a 4-5 star, but until I consistently get the Sam Woo quality, they will never earn the other stars.  

This being said, I would suggest Sam Woo for anyone looking for great Peking Duck or Chinese BBQ.  There are not many other places in town that do it as well as them.We were in China Town Plaza wanting to grab a quick lunch but our little one wanted noodles. It was between this place and Harbor Palace.

We ordered the wonton noodles and dry beef chow fun.
The dishes were your typical decent Chinese food but I felt it wasn't worth the price we paid. Pretty much all the dishes here were overpriced and they didn't even have some sort of lunch menu/specials. 

I have to admit, the service was pretty decent but I think we'll stick to our usual Chinese restaurant, KJ Kitchen. 

P.S. Most of the restaurant near China Town areas are CASH ONLY. So, be sure to bring some cash...good chinese BBQ after a week of vegas buffets haha we ordered the three plate bbq, so it had roast pork, soy sauce chicken and roast duck. it wasnt the best ever, but it his the spot. the vegetable were fresh and tasty as well as the fried rice we ordered. :DI can't speak for other Yelpers but I have never had too much of a problem with the service. However, I do have to say it has been about six months since I have actually sat down to dine there. When we have in the past, the hostess was always very cordial. As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not "Americanized" at all. 

Lately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight. So I guess if you don't want to risk the service at least try the counter where you can see them weight your food for the correct price :-)Fast service, but the food did not make up for it.  Everything went well until my friend and I sat down. The bathroom was a mess and the food was.. Meh. The Thai tea was not as good as it was way too watered down. I wouldn't come back here just because they accept cash ONLY.Good variety of food and for the most part it was average nothing too special the look was nice , sleek and modern and the people were nice .This is a city hospital so don't expect much.  UMC takes all sorts of patients regardless of socioeconomic background. The shuttle driver and the cashier at the cafeteria are rude. 

What I do appreciate with this hospital as a student: I'm exposed to chaos, grumpy nurses (not all) and real patients = real world experience!  Units/rooms are hard to find.  

If you expect to be pampered and treated like a baby, this is not the hospital for you.  Patience tends to run low here (from patients, visitors and employees).Solid, though not overly impressive. The spicy pork was my favorite. The brisket is just that- meat. There is no marinade on it at all. The sides were good. Definitely recommend lunch- cheaper prices, same menu.I regularly eat Korean in Annandale, VA, so this was definitely not the best Korean BBQ I've had, but it's a solid option if you're craving it while in Vegas.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, and the decor is very plain (typical Asian restaurant). The service is just alright - we were seated and served very quickly, but subsequent visits from the waitress were few and far between (annoying when you're trying to take advantage of an AYCE).

The side dishes were pretty good, and I was happy with the larger than usual quantities. The AYCE I ordered included pork belly, beef brisket, spicy chicken, and spicy pork. I usually judge the restaurant by their spicy pork, as it's my favorite, and this one was a little bit hit and miss - the first order we got was really good, but the second one seemed flavorless in comparison.

Next time I'm in town, I'll probably try a different place before coming back to this one.I went here with a few friends on friday and our experience on this night moved me to make this my first review.  First off, I'm a fan of this place, I've been here a few times.  It's a local steakhouse, interesting history, a real old school Vegas feel and definitely a place to try if you're looking for something cool and different in ambiance in LV.  

So the service is eh, average.  Although the host was excited we were there, the waiter was less than friendly, robotic, interested in taking our order, and moving on to the next table. 

The food was good, traditional steak, american and some italian pasta dishes.  We ordered the escargot, crab cakes and calamari.  The escargot were good, buttery and garlic-y.  The crab cakes big, nice and calamari was just ok.  I tried the lobster bisque and it was delicious.  Everyone had a some sort of steak and we shared the asparagus, which were done very well with a nice buttery hollandaise and also mashed potatoes.

When we got our steaks, one was wrong, not just grilled wrong but the wrong cut.  After a 10 minute wait the correct steak was brought out.  And it was disappointing that when the bill came out, we were charged for that steak despite the inconvenience and error on their part....and our starving guest having to wait for his food!  

The Golden Steer has been around forever and obviously do things well and it is a must try place.  In the future though, I may try other local steakhouses unless I'm dragged here again by a GS virgin.  This experience was less than golden so I rate it 3 stars until they fully win me over again.I'm a bit torn writing this review. Our meal was A-OK, but there are at least a dozen other steakhouses I enjoy quite a bit more. That said, this place is a classic. When you step through the doors you are whisked back in time. Hanging on to the past isn't a bad thing. We started with warm bread and followed with a table side Caesar for three. It was pretty average, I don't recommend it. Moving on to the steaks, I had the filet which was nicely prepared. A porterhouse and the bone in ribeye were also had along with the largest baked potato I have ever seen. Total damage was $214 before tip. Ouch... back to present day.Came here looking for a good steak and found it! Sort of... It's all al la carte here. I ordered the prime rib and my boyfriend got the rib-eye. His steak was awesome! Cooked perfect and full of flavor. My prime-rib; however, was not very good. My first bite was awesome. Tender, moist and pure perfection. But as I ate on, I hit spots on the steak that tasted chalky. I don't know what the deal was, but it wasn't right. It didn't even have the texture of meat! Luckily the steaks here are the size of a side of cow so I was able to share my bf's steak. 

The chopped salad was so so. Not your typical steakhouse salad. The only thing steakhouse about this salad was the price. It had large pieces of lettuce, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and lettuce. I didn't even finish it and I shared with my bf! 

The service isn't great either. Our waiter was not attentive. We had to ask for refills twice. He basically dropped our food and never came back until he had something else to drop off. Overall, the experience was okay. For the price, I'd go elsewhere. 

And for those of you wondering about the bread basket.  That was average too. We were given three halves of a mini baguette. I'm sure it was good at one point but it was hard by the time it got to me; wasn't fresh  :(

Overall, I'm not impressed. But if you find yourself here, go for the rib-eye! :)Not quite as good as the last visit. Did the drive thru this time and had 
some issues with the squak box. "Breaker, breaker one-nine, got a car full of hungry dudes. Do you copy? "  We pulled up to the window to finish the order, but the face to face didn't help, as the order was a little messed up. All in all, it was just ok, but not bad enough to scare me away forever. Management said they would make good on the order mess up when we called to inform them of the shortage. Chalk it up to a bad day. We all have 'em.We went there for breakfast a Monday morning.  It was near noon, but they serve breakfast all day.  The place was pretty crowded and seems to be popular with older folks. It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.

Full review at http://www.marga.org/foodblog/2011/08/omelet-house-las-vegas-review/I came here a few times when I lived in Vegas. It's a very cute mom and pop looking place.  If there is a wait it's usually only a few minutes.  The only thing that's disappointing is that they serve these potato spuds that look like potato chips instead of hash browns or breakfast potatoes.  I find that strange in a place thts  known as a breakfast joint.The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ...Capriotti's served up a fair sandwich (philly cheese steak w/ everything...) I'd give them 4 stars - but things were a little disorganized and slow. Price is ok. I plan on going back and seeing if the slow service wasn't just a fluke.

Overall a decent sandwich shop.Got lip augmentation (lip injections ) done here . Nice office ,I didn't wait long .they offer half a syringe for$350 and a full syringe   For $550 . It's a lot but I figured if I was gonna do this might as well show . So they start off by putting this numbing cream on works very well and then they inject u with the syringe I choose to go with  restylane which apparently also had lidocaine . It still felt very uncomfortable and it hurt . After a full syringe I looked and saw the slightest difference which worried me even more when they said the swelling would go down in two days I mean I could barley tell with the swelling . Well a little over half a grand and my lips look exactly the same . No joke . My friend said she always does two full syringes her opinion is that one kind or outlines and defines and the second one pumps ..well I can't imagine spending that much every 3-4 months that they said this last . My lips were also bruised for two days . And now the swelling is done and my lips r back to normal I even joking say they must have injected me with saline or something lol ugh oh well .Yea I know, Food Express Chinese Restaurant, sounds like a place in a Southpark episode. When I arrived, the place was packed with Asians spinning their lazy susans around, which is always a good sign of a good hole in the wall chinese restaurant. The interior had strip mall written all over it from the Casino carpet (probably from Station's Casino) to the cheesy neon fish light fixture, i don't even know what to call it.  
I came here because of the yelp reviews and i was not dissapointed but not wowed. Take into consideration i tried only two dishes, the Mongolian Beef and the Shrimp in black bean sauce. The beef was very delicious, tender, juicy, not over sauced and just the right amount of spice. The Shrimp was standard but i thought they skimped a little on shrimp, all i saw were chunks of bell peppers and onions. The service was good and friendly and i enjoyed my time here. I would give them 3.5 stars and would go back. I did notice a lunch special they had mon-fri for $4.25, looked like a good deal for under $5.00, will try that next time.Tried this place for lunch a few weeks back based on the Yelp reviews, and SOLELY on Yelp reviews as based on principal alone I don't think I'd ever randomly walk into a place called "Food Express"   Just on a whim I could come up with at least 515,129 better names (list coming soon!), but I digress....

Not sure how others use Yelp but I like to type my address and then find the Highest Rated and "Best Matches" within driving distance.   This one kept coming up extremely high on the Best Match list.   Sold.

I then like to find the dishes most people seem to agree on.   Salt and Pepper Pork Chops.   Check.    Called it in and picked it up 15 minutes later.   So far so good.  Upon trying the pork chops, I was slightly underwhelmed.   Perhaps I had too high of expectations?   They were definitely tasty, but I thought they did seem a little greasy/gristly as I was eating them, and they didn't scream "freshly prepared" to me based on the lack of warmth.   Did I eat them all anyway?   Shut up.

So yeah, definitely tasty, not quite as impressive as I was hoping I'd find them, and I havent mentioned it yet but the price was a good value for the amount of food I got.

Won't be in any rush to try it again but it also wouldn't take an act of God to make me try it again (hello Applebees)The food was good with the exception of one item.   However much better than a Panda Express.   

Open late which was nice but the staff is not overly friendly.   Because I prefer all white meat,  I was disappointed the only item was the General Tsao menu item.   I ordered it and it was a deep fried half cut chicken.   No flavor and I had to pick the meat off the bones with two forks. 

Everything else we ordered was good.   Be aware they have an older man with a scowl on his face and others have commented that he's not friendly.   Although he was there,  fortunately we didn't have him as our waiter.The crazy chicken ! For a cheap quick meal. The chicken  was fresh , flavorful , moist and delicious . We had the Cole slaw , mayo based , pretty good.  With the salsa /condiment bar and hot tortillas , it was a tasty mealThis place is an assortment of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

THE GOOD: To get to the point, they have a comprehensive selection of most everything currently put out by Benchmade, Spyderco, all the top brands, and even have some really fine customs. You can find knives by Pat Crawford and Todd Kopp. They have Randall made knives without the six month wait list. They do minor repairs and have countless cheapy knives and countless fine knives and everything in between. 

THE BAD: Expect to pay high retail. On occasion you can spot a deal or they'll throw in some freebies, but you pay way over what you might get these blades for online. Be prepared for your head to swim looking at the thousands of knives piled one on top the other ( though this is also a good thing if you want to handle and check out a model before ordering online ).

THE UGLY: I don't have thousands to spend on their vast selection. Dangit anyhow.

Alas, I can't vouch for their sharpening skills as I haven't utilized them for this purpose. And their staff can be a bit crusty, but I've never had them not be friendly and very knowledgeable. They are a Vegas institution going on 30 years in the biz and can also order knives if you can't find any on the shelves that scream to be taken home.

Bottom line is that they know their stuff and sell there knives dearly. As for the selection of knives, they're like potato chips, betcha can't eat ( buy ) just one.I've only been here once, and it was to see a friend's band play. This place is set in the middle of a strip mall next to a Jamba Juice and Panda Express. You'd probably miss it if you weren't looking for it. The night I went the crowd was mixed, fans of the bands (ranging from your hard rock types to hipsters) and some of what I would assume are regulars. This place is very long, and not very wide, and the bands play at the back of the bar where there is a small stage. 
The first thing I noticed was all the Detroit memorabilia, so if you are a fan of the Lions, Tigers, Pistons or Red Wings (ugh), this may be the place for you. The staff was very nice and the beer was priced okay (I think it was $4.00 for a Sam Adams draft). 
Overall it seemed like a decent chill dark hangout...as many bars are...Very friendly staff, but limited selection of accessories. If you're just looking for a camera or a bag, it's a good stop for you.Came here with a friend the last time I visited her in Vegas, and it was decent boba. I'm from the cupertino (CA) area, so I grew up with boba at my fingertips.  This is not the BEST, but its good when you're craving it.  It was easily lcoated within the huge plaza so we got boba and cruised around Ranch 99 for a while.  I had the Thai Tea which quenched my thirst on the hot day.I got a lychee green tea with bubbles. I was hoping there would be a vegan taro flavored option, but the selection was limited for vegans. My tea was a bit too sweet, but the bubbles were awesome. They were perfectly soft and chewy. Friendly staff.Being from southern California, I'm used to having all of the awesome boba places in Rowland Heights and Garden Grove. Volcano Tea was my first boba experience in Vegas. I've been a few times now, and I'm not sure I'll go back after having tried the boba at Tea Station.

The boba at Volcano Tea is simply okay. The texture is fine, but I prefer my boba to be a little bit on the sweeter side. The main reason for the 3 stars is the inconsistency with the drink/slush. I've had pretty good slushes here--mango if my memory serves me correctly--but I've also had a really bad drink that tasted powdery and artificial. 

All in all, Volcano Tea is a nice place to go if you want to grab boba real quick since it's right off the I-15...but it may be a coin flip on whether or not the drink will be good.What can be said about Volcano Tea. It is a place that serves boba in the most average of ways. Nothing is particularly fresh. Everything is a powder, and tastes like what you'd expect. I used to come here a lot when it was cold for a quick hot milk tea with boba. Perfect solution when you can't get or don't want hot chocolate. The end.The wife and I have been here a couple of times in the past two weeks. I'm pretty picky when it comes to doughnuts so, despite the fact that, rather than seeking out doughnutteries (is that a word?) I should probably be looking for a store that sells fresh carrot and celery sticks as snacks, I am always eager to seek out a new doughnut option.

I'm an aficionado of the cake style doughnut and grew up with the excellent ones from Puffin Fresh, a chain in Australia. Upon entering Ronald's the orange and cherry iced cake options really caught my eye and the wife got some of her preferred cream filled and lemon filled concoctions.

The staff were friendly and I really appreciated the 4AM opening time - convenient for that snack attack moment during the summer while night-owling. The cash only stipulation is a bit of an inconvenience, but the prices are good so it all works out - just remember to carry some cash.

When I tried my doughtnuts I was a little disappointed. They were fine, but while the wife enjoyed her filled ones, I had a number of problems with my iced cake-style doughnuts. Firstly, even mere minutes after opening for the day, on both of my visits I have found the doughnuts a bit too hard and dry as though they had been left to cook for a few minutes too long. The second visit two of my six doughnuts featured a really rough, crunchy bottom layer which held more than a hit of grease. These two doughnuts were really unpleasant with the rest being what I would categorise as "fine".

My second issue with Ronald's is I found the doughnuts to be just too sweet. I'm sure everyone is thinking "Well what do you expect! It's a doughnut!", but I mean SWEET - to the point where I would often have to stop eating my doughnut halfway through lest I enter a sugar coma. They really load these up with sweetener and I for one think they've overdone it just a tad. 20% less sugar and 20% less fry time and I think you'd end up with my perfect doughnut.

All in all Ronald's makes some decent doughnuts, but I think the overall Yelp rating here is about a star too high. It could also be an indication of my own particular out-of-steppedness with the American palate when it comes to sweets. (I have to buy artisan bread because standard American white bread tastes like dessert food to me because of the added sugar we don't get in our bread at home)

If you're craving a doughnut at the crack of dawn or just need to fight off a bout of hypoglycæmia, Ronald's might fit the ticket. For me, the great doughnut search continues.We've seen this place every time we've come to LV but usually, on our way back to the hotel AFTER we've had our meal. I really wanted to try it because I've seen the Chinese writing as we've whizzed by and it says they have things like jook, wonton noodle soup and much more.

We ordered wonton soup, bitter melon with beef, pei pah tofu (House special tofu) and some gai lan with oyster sauce.

Won ton soup -- this was the most disappointing ever. The wrapper was mushy and soggy, most probably overcooked! the filling wasn't tasty either with bits of gristle which I had to spit out. Don't order this!

Bitter melon with beef -- really flavorful! the beef was tender with generous portions of bitter melon

Pei Pah tofu -- a lot of places don't do this dish because it's a lot of work. this dish consists of mashed tofu with bits of shrimp and sometimes with scallions although this one didn't. I didn't think the tofu was as flavorful as it could've been, but still very nice, served atop a bed of garlic spinach.

Gai lan with oyster sauce -- all prime gai lan bits, very tender and perfectly cooked!

I liked everything except for the won tons. I would come back again for the regular dishes, not the won tons. The only complaint is that the food is on the greasy side. Otherwise, not bad at all.

I'd say 3.5 starsIt's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back. 

Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!  

Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:

* Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.

* Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.

* Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.

* Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.

And from their regular menu: 

* Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!

They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.  

Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.

One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!     

Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!

(Yep, there's pics of our food eats in the business profile!)decent fast-food style chinese/cantonese/vietnamese don't really know but it is damn good. super sheap Lunch specials, rice & noodles are always right-on and spicy is spicy. way too much food!!not "real" mexican food but a decent substitute in a pinchgood food but portions are now alot smaller, service is good but sometimes a little off. 

hell they got my order completely wrong before. the atmosphere is great if you like it loud like the bar. the jack daniel's sauce is fabulous. the steaks are good, the shrimp is good too. 


waiters/waitresses: showing off by not writing down my order will instantly lose your tip. it is not impressive when everytime it is wrong. and honestly if i wanted my s*%$ messed up i'd go to a fast food joint where nobody speaks english and take my chances there.

drinks refills: if i drink 2 glasses of whatever before my food comes, offer to leave a pitcher at the table or be prepared to run your ass off and not bitch about.

3rd: when we ask for something "special" as in not the way it is stated on the menu-do it!! i'm the one paying for this. i certainly don't feel i need to remind you when you bring my food out.

overall-i really enjoy the food & drinks at friday's but the servers? and i'm the type who leaves a standard 30% tip unless not deserved and believe me if we leave "no" tip we are taking it up with the manager. $60 bucks for lunchUsually can't go wrong with the JD chicken and shrimp.  Desserts are pretty satisfying as well.I have mixed emotions about this place.  It's open late, which is awesome.  Food is decent, but nothing fantastic.  Service has always been sub-par.  But somehow I keep going back... hmmm...This is my mom and dad's favorite Chinese restaurant. The mixed fried rice is great, the chicken (any recipe really) is awesome and I absolutely love the soup.

The only problem I have for this place is that the servers can be a little pushy sometimes. Not every time, but the second to last time I went there, the dude was slightly rude...and there was like 5 other partys, with like 5 other servers...CALM DOWN.Needing to get away from the Vegas strip for awhile, we searched on Yelp for a good Chinese restaruarnt and our party of 6 decided to come here for dinner.

We ordered:
3/5 Spicy hot and sour soup $14.25
3/5 Imperial peking duck $39
4/5 Seafood combo claypot with tofu $15.50
3/5 Eggplant, pork and bamboo claypot $12.50
5/5 Taiwan A vegetables $11.50
3/5 Yang Chow fried rice $11.95
Tsing Tao beer $3 each

The Peking duck was a bit disappointing as the skin was not as flavorful and crispy and the man who filleted the skin did not do a very good job. There were uneven pieces but nevertheless, we got to have Peking duck. The claypots were okay. The sauce was a bit heavy. The stir-fried A vegetables was the best! Over all we had a fun meal but the quality was just okay.The environment is clean with a spacious dining area. 

There is a wide menu selection of seafood items 

We ordered the following dishes:

1) Yang chow fried rice with BBQ pork and shrimp.

2) Fillet fish with vegetables

3) Sesame chicken

4) Half duck

My favorites were the fried rice and sesame chicken. The taste of each dish is average.If I was writing this review 2 years ago this place would have 5 stars without a doubt. The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.

The prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years.The baked items are awesome. 
Owners attitude sucks.

Shortest review ever.Really slow service but great boba the food is okay.This is to place I go to for jasmine green milk tea with boba.  The boba is soft and chewy, like how it should be.  There are so many boba places out there where the boba is hard because it has been sitting out too long.  When that happens, it kills the drink for me.  Now talk about the jasmine green tea, it is brewed here.  Many other places have the powder kind, which again, I dislike.  

I had taiwanese food here before but only remembered that they all taste a little different, not as flavorful.  I tried the chicken nuggets, and other stuff.  Have not ordered any food here since.

Service...They could do soooo much better.  Sometimes, it feels like they don't want our business or something.

Until I find another boba joint that brew their own tea, I am sticking to this one.the fruit blends with boba and the almond milk tea are oh sooo yummy! the toast with sugar is sinfully good the only reason why they get 3 stars is because the service is so so.I still need to get my boba fix even when I am vacationing in Vegas...I usually always go here when I'm in Vegas. Pretty much the same as any other Tea Station that I have been to. 

Their boba is good. Its soft and chewy. Prices here in my opinion are a bit high for boba. Service, like all the other Tea Stations that I have been to, is not very friendly, but this is one of the better boba places in vegas to go to. 

My usual drinks are:
-Milk tea
-Jasmin/Green Milk tea
-Thai Tea
-Coffee Milk teaI think this place has potential to be amazing.  (I have a feeling my 8th grade PE coach used to say the same thing about me as I never was able to do a full pull up back then )  But anywho...  the drinks are great.  This one time I ordered an unsweetened black ice tea with boba.  But I asked the watier to put fresh lychee in it.  (This is not on the menu, and he was confused at the order, but he made it happen!)  It was delicious and the fresh lychee added a slight sweetness to the drink. 

So I have a boring life and had been talking about this drink for quite some time, and I brought a friend here to try it with me.  Another worker was there, and said I couldn't have this because there is no such thing.  I told her that I have had it before.  That didn't help my argument.  My friend thought I was crazy and I was making orders up.  So I have yet to be back, my heart will break if I can never have this amazing drink again.I love their Thai Tea! Yummy!!!
The only concern I have about this place is the location. The parking here sucks! cars are constantly blocking other cars and in the past month, I've witnessed 2 hit and runs.. omg. When I go here, I usually park it next door where the 99 Ranch Market is and walk..... :)I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... I haven't been to this place in forever because of their service. And that sucks because it used to be a favorite spot.

I'm not really into teas, so this review would have to be towards service and what I do see. 

Yes, they may have good drinks, but their boba is a little bit more on the pricey side. I feel like people go here because it's the "cool" thing to do. It's a perk that they're open late, but they get extremely busy at times. And even when it's not busy, service still sucks. People like to come here and just sit for hours to talk or play games, so sometimes it takes a while if you wanna sit in.

The last experience was a horrible one. We came in with a large party of about 10 people. We waited for a table and when we finally got one 30 minutes later, the dude who served us just told us to sit down, put the menus on the table, and walked away. That was the last we saw of him. It took about 45 minutes for us to realize they weren't going to take our order... So we left. Mind you, during that whole time I would look at him to take our order and he kept on saying, hold on with his hand gestures, and would continue on talking to another worker behind the counter. Throughout this time he would also serve other people, and people who sat after us, and still had yet to take our order. We all said forget it and left. And he stared at us as we walked out. Right after he walked to the table and grabbed the menus. Sucks cause we were all super hungry and wanted to try some food AND boba! It's as if he didn't even care to get our business. 

If I could, I would have given it 2 stars. But I added one more because their strawberry slush is good, from what I used to know. Now, I just pass this place whenever I'm in China town. There are a bunch of other boba places that are just as good with better prices and much better service who care about their customers.

My friends and I haven't been there since.Good for hot tea. but usually I go for boba and the boba is only OK. I would have given 4 stars for variety but their lychee jelly sucks. they have the opaque flaccid kind, not the  chewy clear kind.I ate here for breakfast last week during a visit to Las Vegas. The breakfast was reasonably priced (for a location on the Strip) and the service was fast and attentive. I loved their pancakes and the location is convenient if you are inside of the Stratosphere.When I stayed at Stratosphere, the food was AMAZING for brunch. I loved the varieties of food and the service. Moreover, I believe I paid $24 for the whole entire day. That was awesome! The only problem was dinner was quite lackluster. The level of quality seemed to dip dramatically. When I came back to Stratosphere on another trip when I went out of my way to see the American Superstars show (which is gone now regrettably) and paid only $5 extra to get the buffet in addition, I was still bothered by the low level of quality in the food for dinner. The food seemed old and dry and not flavorful. So, perhaps the way to go is to enjoy their brunches. Awesome, fresh donuts and desserts then too! If it were their brunch, they would get 5 stars!If your in the hotel or casino and looking for a decent meal than this will do. Food is okay just typical buffet food at a decent price.I would probably give this buffet 3.5 stars. Let me start out by saying it's not the best of the best when it comes to buffets but it is good for the price. Some state the price is too high but lets face it people, this is Las Vegas, prices are going to be high. Besides even where I live the crappy Chinese buffet is about the same price.

Let's move on to the food. I arrived at breakfast and was first in line and waited for them to open. Perfect time to go to a buffet as everything is fresh. I ate pretty much only breakfast foods because it was very early, my last day in vegas and I had pretty much reached my limit food wise.

There were hits and misses. The pancakes HIT! had seconds of those. When i got there they were wrapped in Saran wrap and so soft and tender. By the time I went for seconds the wrap was removed (I in fact removed it) and the pancakes were crusty. 

The chicken fried steak and gravy, miss. Flavorless. As was the corned beef hash and eggs benedict. Strike that, the eggs Benedict had flavor, it was just an odd flavor. Lots and and lots pastries to choose from! Very delicious.

There were lots of dinner options out which I had none of as it was simply too early. I have uploaded several photos so you can check them out.

Omelet station as well as cereal station and lots of fruit. Some of the items were still not out yet as i noticed some of tables were empty.

So i'm rating this for breakfast. for under $20 I had an excellent breakfast with many options. Granted I didn't enjoy some of the items but its easy enough to find something I thoroughly enjoyed.

My waiter was flamboyant, amusing and attentive. He was a joy first thing in the morning

http://www.meonlybetterfitness.comFood is really good, but no one sang when we went there this afternoon.  The sign said 2pm-2am is when the waitressess sing during their shift.  I was there 220pm-340pm and no one sang.

Service was excellent and menu had a lot of diner options for a really good price, but I was hoping to hear some singing.Cramped, messy, and some items/sizes not in stock . . . Enough said!FAQ

Q: My god, are you really trying to get me to go to *this* Denny's? You gotta be fucking kidding me.
A: Let's say you've been driving all night. Let's say that Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) was real busy that night. Let's say the hotel doesn't check you into until 11.00am. Let's say you're really, really hungry. Let's say you wanted a Sampler Platter and substitute the Onion Rings for seasoned fries. Let's say this Denny's is the ideal location. Let's say there is no shame in going to this Denny's.

Q: Why is this Denny's so sad at 5.32am?
A: Between the hours of 4.00am and 6.00am on a non-holiday weekend, this town is just sadness. Trust me. I know.

Q: You are a sad, sad human being.
A: You should try asking more questions, anyway, let's just say that after growing up in California/Los Angeles and after driving 7 hours (stupid 15 Fwy traffic), there's no better thing than the host asking you: Smoking or Non-Smoking?

Clearly, we were in the Smoking section.

FYI ... It *is* sad. But it's away from the hustle and bustle and it's a good way to "get away from it all" before you dive back into The Strip. I was gonna give this 2-stars. Fuck it. Three it is.Since I made the moved to Vegas, everyone seemed to rave about this place. I say, it's okay. I've had the banana nut custard - western style, as well as, malt cream and peanut butter custard. The way people talked about this place, I was waiting for it to be heaven in my mouth...not so much. It's okay. If you like frozen custard, this place is worth a try. It has a very nice view of the stratosphere but the location is very sketchy. There's a lot of homeless people around asking for money. Just say no. I know of someone who tried to be nice and give one of these guys money...we watched him walk into the liquor store shortly after.The sandwiches were excellent; everything else, not so much. Meats that were dry and tasteless outside two slices of bread were tender and satisfying between them. My Cubano was well-constructed and well-seasoned, though the accompanying fries were just OK. Nevertheless, the sandwiches make this a solid cheap-by-Vegas-standards option that doesn't require you to get off Las Vegas Blvd. Don't get married here though.I've been here years ago, but for some reason haven't been back. 

A few friends suggested coming here as they haven't been in a long time as well and a few in our party never been. 

We shared appetizers of - 

Jamon Croquettas - so think of if ham were fish sticks, then that would be this. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again. 

Chicarones - these were served warm and were nicely crunchy. Solid chicaron. 

And they serve you white bread rolls slathered in butter. 

The BF and I shared - 

Cuban Sandwich with fries - This was a decent sandwich, but not the best I've had. Get it with the plaintain chips if you're into them as someone in our party got those and I thought that was better as the fries are standard. 

Pernil de Cerdo Asado - the pork was pretty tender and the red beans were pretty good. I feel it was missing something like a sauce though. I order something similar in LA and it's in a mojo sauce and I could have sworn eons ago when I was here last my meat was more citrusy. 

Service was just OK. Sometimes it seemed like they didn't really care and seemed to mishear us a lot. "Okay, french fries" "No, chicarones." "Oh okay". "Chuletas de Cerdo" "No, Pernil de Cerdo" "Oh'. Someone got black beans instead of what they actually ordered. 

It's a unique place with some charm. I feel it was slightly better years ago when we used to go. I remember really loving the pork back then, but I didn't feel the love as much now. I would probably eat here again when there is a hankering, but it sits right in the middle of the road for me.This place is what is..... A BIG ASS souvenir shop AKA a junk store that smells like China when you walk through the doors! But when people come to Vegas they want to buy keepsakes of their vacation and they want to haul a ton of crap back home so they will forever be reminded of their drunken bender they spent on the glorious LV Strip, just proving what happens in Vegas doesn't really stay in Vegas! This place is perfect for any level of hoarder whether you are beginner or advanced and what makes it even better is it's cheap! Though half the stuff you buy from here will fall apart or be broken by the time it makes its way back to your curio cabinet it's okay because you will have only paid a $1 for that broken shot glass and you will probably have purchased more than you needed anyway because they were only a $1 and you wanted to get the whole damn set! Oh, they had you with that big sign out front that reads "If we have it, it's in stock!" Well no Shit!! But you just couldn't resist and now you are that smuck on the airplane with bags and bags of crap taking up all the overhead space!!
What makes this place even better is that it's always an adventure going here, first you have to get through the shady parking lot, second you get to experience the staff and they have taken customer service to a whole new level, in fact you may feel like you are on the set of a reality prank show, except there is no host to come out and say SURPRISE your on TV!!  My advice is don't go alone and watch yourself there at night!  
For all if this I give ye ol' Worlds Largest three stars!What happens at the Olympic Garden...will totally be photographed and kept in a locked iphone gallery to be used for blackmail later.

That is, if you're rolling with a crew of hott ladies for a bachelorette party and you want to completely embarrass the hell out of the bachelorette. We seemed to be the only gang who thought this was uncomfortably hilarious, in fact, most of the other ladies were downright mesmerized. 

While completely scared to even enter and going "only because we are taking the piss" we ended up having a seriously good time, and laughing A LOT. Gotta give it to them, they are entertaining! Cuban guy seemed to be the most revered of them all.

We got a great deal. A limo ride there, cover, a bottle of champagne, and 2 drinks a piece for $80 a person. Once in we were swarmed as the gents tried to manipulate us into paying for all kinds of lap dances. Seeing as we weren't the most wasted group, they moved on, but seriously be prepared. These guys are sharks.

Downstairs was kinda dull, especially compared to the raucous anything-goes vibe of the upstairs. I'd tell the gents to check out Spearmint Rhino or another fine establishment instead.THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE MALE REVUE!! 

I was there this weekend for my friends Bachelorette party, there were 12 girls, we had set up our visit prior to arriving thru RED CARPET VIP - we had a limo take us to the club, with entrance for the entire party, 2 drinks and a VIP table with dance for the bachelorette.  When we sat down the waiter advised us if we spent 90 bucks more we could instead have 2 bottles of liquor with all the mixers. This was a better deal for us because we all can drink more then 2 drinks and after that the drinks were about 13 bucks each.

The show was pretty good, most of the guys were good looking with nice bodies.  They put on themed shows like one is fireman, doctor, etc.  The dance for our bachelorette was really good! We also got more dances for the Maid of Honor and two more for the bride.  WE HAD A BALL! The guys were all very nice!!! 

We all were kind of skeptical about a male strip club cause sometimes they seem corny but this turned out to be a really fun night!!! The music was good too we typically like hip hop but there was a nice variety!O-M-G 
Devirginized to male strip clubs at OG and I kind of want that flower back...

I went here with a bachelorette party and we only stayed in the male strip club area after a night of clubbing (around 2am)

Here's the break down:
1) Money spent:
We got a deal for $25/person for two drinks and entrance, which I didn't think was too shabby.  However, when we got our drinks, we totally regretted it.  We all got vodka cranberries and they all tasted like rubbing alcohol.  Granted we were super inebriated and we couldn't even hold this vodka down.  When the bride wasn't feeling well, I went to ask for water, which you have to pay by the bottle.  I spent $10 for 6oz. of water!!! UGHHHHHH 

2) Strippers:
This was such a cuuuhhhhrazyyyyy experience for me.  The male strippers were grabbing the girls on the sides and pulling them halfway up on the stage, smacking their booties and motorboating them. SOOO CRAZY and UNEXPECTED.  My friend, the bride, was freaked out and could not handle being near the stage, so we went back to our booth.  The guys walked around and asked if she wanted a lap dance but we adamantly refused!  The girls next to us got "lap dances" which basically entailed the guy banging up on the girl for about 5 minutes while all of her friends screamed, laughed, and took pictures.  The guys were okay looking, but didn't have very good dance moves.  Imagine someone who was trained by a Britney Spears dancer wannabe who mainly point toward their penile area.  

Oh goodness, I can go on forever about my experience here.  All in all, it was very entertaining, but just so crazy.  I'm debating on whether or not I would want to go again for another friend's bachelorette.  We'll see....Good food, surley staff.

Agree with the loud soap opera, but it adds to the experience.

Entree was great, beans and rice not so much.

A little pricy for what they are serving, and don't bother asking about vegetables.

Fried plantains where out of this world, although you might have better ambiance eating in your car.Al pastor fries, two carne asada tacos, one large horchata. About $12.50. Came here because the lines at a competing taco place were ridiculous. The guys working were really nice and the horchata was super yummy. Food was served up quickly. The boyfriend said the asada was a little dry and while my fries were good (meat, nacho cheese, queso fresco, sour cream) I wouldn't have minded guac and a little more meat. I would come back because of the low price and/our if my original restaurant choice didn't pan out.Burrito as big as your thigh! Could be thicker, but I'm spoiled because of SF's El Farolito... Definitely stop by Los Tacos if you want a good taco or burrito and are in the hood; Not really worth the trip if you're not. Veggie burrito didn't come with rice, but the beans were really good.Little art studio outside the Strip.  the good is that it's free.  but most of the art was just average.Our usual dining group went to the cafe this week. We ordered a variety of dishes and ate family style. My favorites were the rolled cabbage and the dumplings. The red cabbage and sauerkraut were good, but the potatoes and spatzel were just okay. The wiener schnitzel was over cooked and dry. The desserts were excellent.A little bit empty place with plenty of dinner and lunch optionsThis is a fairly good option for lunch if you work downtown.

It might take a little more than just an hour, so if you work at a place that is very stringent about time, be warned.

It's pretty standard American fare - burgers, chicken dishes, pasta dishes, sandwiches, and some lunch-size portions of some of the dinner options (like the filet medallions which I do recommend).  Prices are fair too.

The service is usually really smooth.  Sometimes there is the need to remind a server for a beverage refill.  

Parking can sometimes be problematic as the private lot is shared with some shops and another restaurant.

All in all, a good option for lunch for those that work downtown.I hang out at Cue Club all the time.  True, I don't come here nearly as often as I used to (try five times a week), but I still swing by once or twice a week or AT LEAST once every two weeks.  I gotta see my peeps, yo.

It is in a kind of ick place, but it's really not that bad. Get out of your car, walk to the entrance, good job.  If you show up in the middle of the day, you don't have to have an ID on you to get in...but someone needs one in exchange for the table balls.

Now, the tables are pretty much crap.  Warped, dirty, torn felt, cues with splintered shafts, etc etc.  But if you just want to play some chill pool and hang out with your friends in a pool hall...they serve their purpose.  While many of you may have seen my exceptional pool skills on ESPN, no one who frequents this place watches it so I can easily play in peace without being mobbed by a gaggle of groupies.  

Pros:
Touch my Tunes
Full bar
Pac Man
Big enough to avoid carcinogenic haze if you so chose
AWESOME staff members--we even talk in other public places and know each other by name
$1.00 quarter tables
The regular snooker guys are hilarious 
Curfew--18+ only after 9 pm means no teeny bops loitering/making out

Cons:
Ghettosville, NV
Smoking is allowed (see above)
Tables are basically crap
Need an ID to get in after curfewLas Vegas here we are!! Came with a couple girls for my friend's bachelorette party. As soon as we landed we were craving sushi and I was trying to find a sushi place that was close and Tokyo Japanese Restaurant popped up. As soon as we settled into our hotel suite, we jumped into a taxi, and made our way to Tokyo Japanese Restaurant.

The area is a bit secluded. There are other small restaurants and shops there, but it looked really dead. When we went inside, the restaurant itself was kind of small and there wasn`t really anyone there. Because there was a group of us, they put us in one of their private rooms which was nice.

Their menu wasn`t that big and they didn`t have a lot of options, so we just ordered a bunch of sushi, two rolls, and an order of fresh oysters. We also wanted to get the fun started, so we got a couple shots of Johnny Walker.

As we were eating, the manager walked in and asked us if we were doing okay. Later, we got something special that the manager had sent to us. I don`t know what it was, but it was yummy. She also gave us another round of Johnny Walker shots on the house. AWESOME!!

Overall, the food was okay. The service was great. The prices were pretty reasonable. I`m used to going to sushi bars that have all you can eat, so I expected the bill to be a little more than it would be if we were to go to an all you can eat sushi bar, but the fact that the manager gave us some free food and free shots, it was some what worth it.Their Birria is pretty tasty...they do one thing and do it pretty well. Not gamey and pretty hearty. the only starch is the tortillas that accompany your meal...give them a shot and see what you think.......ALOHA!!!Buffet and Vegas has been old for a while for me.  Just fill me up and I'm good to go.  This place is a typical Filipino fast food with a pretty decent size seating capacity.  You get in line, pick up a tray and you choose the most greasy item in the menu because that is the best tasting artery blocking meal.

Two item sir, yes sir.  Turon, halo halo, and coconut drink please.  Then may I have extra napkins please.  Pay for the meal and take a seat.  There was a time where I would not worry about the grease, but now, I spend an extra 5 minutes to get as much of the oil off as possible.  I'd like to postpone my heart attack another day.

Favorite items:

Bistek
Beef Kaldereta
Lechon
BBQ chicken skewer
Sinigang
Turon
Halo halo
Coconut

Pros: good for large parties, fast food, good value
Cons: heart attack alley

There are other Filipino restaurants which I will try when I am in the area again, but this place is always a favorite compared to going to Jollibee or Chow King.Friendly staff, great price, huge parking
but its a common type of filipino dishIt'd been years since we last ate here, maybe within months of opening (a while ago). I should begin the review with an explanation/disclaimer; growing up, after finding out what everything was, in filipino cuisine, I became a picky eater. I was the one cutting off all the fat off the meat. I don't like greasy foods, in general (plus, being pregnant, things are not always agreeing with my system). I stuck to safe things because in all honesty, I don't eat all animal flesh (limit it to beef, chicken, sometimes pork, turkey, seafood and shellfish). And it's not like I don't eat fatty foods at all, I just select the days (I eat carefully on most days, but on the weekends, I eat what I want; it helps my figure). We don't go to a lot of filipino restaurants (but this doesn't mean that I'm less of a Pinay, I know alot about the history, I do know Tagalog, though I am not fluent, and I could go on and on about Pinoys in Hollywood, believe me, I am proud). 

Located in Amall, on the corner of Sahara and Maryland Parkway (the one with 7-11 on the corner), the cafeteria-style restaurant  (you select your items and pay at the end of the aisle, before sitting down to eat) is located in the elbow of the strip mall. Inside is spacious with lots of seating, tables & chairs. Trays are placed on top of the trash cans located near the doors. Bathrooms are located in the back of the restaurant. It is clean, however, we did see a dirty tray (had food stuck on it), which the employee promptly picked up upon seeing that it was set aside. And when we sat down, noticed that there was a B grade up on the wall. My husband also noticed that something was cleaned up with a dirty rag, which was then placed on top of the counter. 

We had cousins, and my auntie, in town so we met them here for lunch last saturday afternoon. My husband and I each chose the two-item plates (two scoops of rice, pancit, and BBQ sticks), a drink, and I also got the bibingka, and my husband got the turon (oops, forgot to tell him it was made with filipino bananas). The cashier was nice and cracked a joke about the sticky balls on a stick (carioca). The rice was plentiful, the BBQ sticks were cold and more on the fatty side, and the pancit was ok. (Also, another reason why I am picky with filipino food is that my mom's pancit and lumpia were the best. When there is such a high standard, it's hard to have anything else). The caldereta did look good, and maybe I would've enjoyed my lunch if I had that instead. Ok, I have to share this funny story abut our nephew, my sister's oldest. I didn't know that he liked dinuguan, and I told him what it was before he ordered it, when we were in line. He was eating it, and had this uncertain expression on his face. And then said, "What is this?" My immediate reaction was to laugh heartily, as I always do (sorry, I have a loud laugh). My husband later said that he wished he had recorded the whole thing (see, he can't have dessert unless he finishes the meal, it's the rule). I did enjoy the bibingka, I do love filipino desserts! Masarap. The turon @ $1.50 was really good and such a generous size too. The cost of our meals was over $21.00. My sister, brother-in-law, and their older boys split a couple halo-halo's- served in glass dishes similar to ice cream sundaes, which looked good, but I love Chow King's version (in Seafood City). If I wanted some filipino dessert, I could stop here, since it's in the neighborhood.  

There were other customers in the restaurant but I would't say that it was crowded, especially for the weekend (when we moved here in 1991, there weren't many choices and now due to a higher pinoy population, there are lots of choices for us; and the most popular is Seafood City).I've been coming to this place for years. 7 years to be exact, ever since I first moved to Vegas. It was my first taste of Filipino food that I missed from my mom. 

I remember the first time I came here and I was so excited. I thought the combo was a great deal and the actual amount of portion food they give you is a lot! I have never been able to eat all my food and I am a fat ass and can often throw down, so this is saying a lot! 

Is this is the best Filipino food ever? Not even close, I mean come on. You know how it goes, "my mom the best Filipino food." But they do some good lechon and I love their dinuguan. And yes, to the halo halo with ice cream. I also love the variety assortments of Filipino deserts they have. I think they have some of the best flan I have ever had. 

However, I will admit there have been occasions where I went and my food was on the cold side and just not as tasty as I know it can be. But I keep coming back to this place. The staff is friendly and I always feel welcome here. 

It's buffet style as  you grab your tray, and pick from the options they have out for the day. You can get a two or three item combo. 

As a Filipino, who doesn't look Filipino I hate when I go into a Filipino place and get the looks like, "why is she in here?" I never feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in this place. And more than not, the food is always decent. And at great prices I will always come back to this place.These nurses are undervalued! They hate their jobs and are vocal about it to patients. I will say Terry, Jissy and Marisa in MICU are phenomenal! And Dr Fiekes the Cardio Surgeon too. Although sometimes it felt like when my family and I asked questions the nurses besides the named above were insulted that we asked and irritated to answer the question. I even asked some Qs about after my dad was discharged and they told me not to worry bout it, um seriously? That response alone makes me worry. One nurse kept talking to my dad during her shift after it took her about 45 minutes to bring a pain pill for a headache the night before major surgery, he even told her repeatedly that he was trying to sleep, eventually he got rude about it, but come on, if some one in pain the night before surgery doesn't want to small talk with you can't you just respect that, she kept saying he needed rest weNot the best outlet store, but it's a hit or miss here. I've found really great sales where everything is almost free, but other times it seems like everything is regular price. 

One thing to look out for are some Evisu jeans. Sometimes you can find some for less than $70.I am a huge Oakley fan.The store had most of what you would want, and the store has a nice look about it, the prices are about the same as the internet prices, it is nice to see it before you buy it. I wish the store was bigger. Some of the staff had a little uppity attitude, but I equate it to age and maturity level as it is a ll young people that work there, you wont see any one over 30 on the sales floor, that is too bad, like older people don't wear Oakley too? Over all it is a cool store, and I would go back.Many many moons ago I used to live in this area and have seen what
kind of shenanigans can go down at the seven seas ... But... during the day when you're feeling hungry and the only thing that will make you feel better is cat fish nuggets then dammnit.. The Seas can't be beat!!

Im a huge fan of their cat fish and even their hot links are grilled to
perfection. The food is greasy and comforting when you need just that kind of fix. If you want anything healthy you're absolutely in the wrong establishment. 

There is a bar next door that opens at noon and while waiting for my food I ventured over to ask about their drinks. They have two for Tuesdays drink specials on everything except top shelf drinks which as we know can't be beat. 

I'll be back to The Seas but I doubt it will be anytime soon.. there simply not enough stuff on their limited menu to bring me in week after week but its still ... regardless !This is your basic grocery store experience. If you're looking for it, they've probably got it in one way or another. I was pleasantly surprised to see such a beautiful selection of produce. Everything was in tip-top shape and looked great, there was an attendant in the produce section - sprucing things up to keep everything in order. 

Sale items are clearly marked with large yellow signs and there are several areas throughout the store offering a 10 for $10 option. I was also happy to see a bountiful selection of wines located inside the store.

The best discovery of all is that my Kentucky Kroger savings card worked at the register, saving us $18 :)Food is great but this location is almost always understaffed and wait times of more than 5-10min are not uncommon and much longer during busy weekday lunches. Staff is not particularly friendly or welcoming due to their work load.The nurses have really bad attitudes but the doctor was really friendly. I had been waiting in the room for 45 minutes and I went out to let them know because maybe I had was forgotten about? The nurse wasn't very nice when she told me why and didn't even offer up an apology. The nurse who did my pre screening was kind of mean too.Went on 24 December. 

Comic Oasis has a large selection of comics. They keep a number of graphic novels in stock as well, however these are dominated by Marvel. If that's your thing, cool. If you're looking for something else, you'll need a little luck. Very few games, and a moderate amount of toys. Not a bad place, but way more comic influenced than games, RPGs, ect.So I brought my niece here for her birthday on Monday, Sept. 2 and it was my first time ever coming here. My first impression when I walked through those doors doors?!? WOW!!,....this place smells of SWASS (sweat and ass). I mean don't get me wrong, it's cheap and entertaining for the kids and yes they have good prices on their pizza but how can you have a party and eat when the place smells of swass??? All I'm saying is febreeze the place.

On the other hand, like I mentioned before it was fun for those of you who enjoy go karts and all and very entertaining for kids. I do believe it's a good place to throw parties at. They have the $20 wristbands where you can ride all the rides for 1 hour which isn't too bad but when it's busy and you waste most of your time in line, then I thinks it's expensive. It should be more like $15 for 1 hour. As for the menu, I really like that you can see them cook your food so you know exactly what's going on. They have the large 1 topping pizza for $6 which is a good deal but that's only valid Mon-Thurs.Always wanted to stop by, just never did till today. The place is much larger on the inside then it looks. The decor is impressive and not over the top. Two full size pool tables and plenty of room for everyone to relax while you play. Two digital dart games as well.
I was disappointed in the fact they don't have a kitchen so no food, but the bartender stated they may be getting it back soon, so I will definately be back to check it out again.This store was pretty clean and had some pretty good deals, especially with several racks of red tag clearance items this past weekend. I had an issue with the checkout process, however, which is why I can't give them 4 stars. For buying only 2 items we were at the registers for what felt like 15 min because the associate couldn't figure out how to scan my items. I guess one of the stickers was messed up and wouldn't scan correctly....but rather than go and grab another one that had a good tag or manually key in the sku or numbers on the tag, she spent 5 min trying to peel the sticker and then stepped away without any explanation for 5-10 min and then came back with a new tag she had made for it. Hopefully she was just a new employee and next time this won't happenGreat food for the price and real great if you are pressed for time. Depending on which location you are at, they also serve Korean BBQ at some of their spots, and that would have to be my favorite at this place.

Althought the food isn't authentic, you will definitely find a dish you can dig into for the time you are there. I prefer the lunch time just because you really get so much food for your money.Not bad for a buffet.  About $8/person for lunch.  Decent variety.Have eaten there many times and always had a good experience.

Unfortunately, I went there last week for lunch and the place is closed, out of business. I understand they have a store on the east side of town that is still open, but since I don't work on that side of town, it doesn't do me much good.

I'm going to miss it.This place is perfect if your looking for a lite lunch. 

I went here because I wanted something new. It was fairly cheap I think it was about $6 bucks a person with drinks and tip it was about $20 total. 

Food is good not great but good 

They have a variety of different salads and toppings such as eggs, bacon sunflower seeds etc...Variety of soups creamy cheese broccoli, veggie soup and a chicken noodle.They also had pizza and tacos, and they have a dessert bar. 

This place is nothing to run home to momma and brag about but its good cheap and fast...Just came here for lunch and i have to admit, i was not too impressed. I ordered chicken pad thai and it was really plain. All it was, was noodles with like 4 little pieces of chicken and lettuce on the side. The dish wasn't so bad but it would have 4 or 5 stars if they upped the favor and how much stuff they add to the dish. Besides that, its a pretty nice restaurant with friendly staffWhen I go to Best Buy, I usually know what I'm looking for.  So I have no beef with the prices.  Also, since I do all tech support myself, I don't have a beef with the Geek Squad or warranty either.

Now, this particular Best Buy is my least favorite in town because it's old and not as clean as the others, which is the reason for my 3 Stars.  The employees here are satisfactory, but not great.  The store serves it's purpose for my needs, which is to satisfy my fix for electronics immediately.  I normally buy electronics & computer equipment online because it's cheaper for the same products.....however, every once in a while I'll need to have my fix and if I'm not in the mood to drive to Fry's I'll stop by here.

My last visit, which was yesterday....my son was shopping for his 1st cell phone.  We went to take a look at various models from different companies.  One great thing about Best Buy is that they have all of the major cell companies under one roof so we don't have to drive all over Blazed Egypt to browse.  After screwing around the cell phone area we wandered over to the Xbox 360 aisles......yeah, I got Fuschnickened by my son into "taking a look" at some games......$100 bucks later I had to explain to wifey why we were coming home with video games after a cell phone expedition.  Plus, we ended up at Game Stop after this Best Buy trip.

Will I return?  The next time I start shaking and need a new gadget....possibly.I used to love Best Buy.  This was my place to get CDs on the cheap.  Now CDs are harder to come by with  the popularity of digital music which I have not fully accepted as of yet.  But what little stock Best Buy has now is just sad and disorganized.  They just don't seem to care about organizing or restocking the shelves.  It is so hard to determine if the have what I am looking for because a CD from say Rammstein for example may not be in the R section.  Instead try looking for it in the K's just because.  The apathy does not end there.  Across the store the staff just seems to be going through the motions.  Like they are ask if you need assistance not because they want to help but because it is their job and they get paid to ask.  It is uncomfortable to be in there shopping these days.I just started shoping ay the Mens wearhouse this summer. this store has some good employes the other day I went in to find some pants I wanted to get to match a vest i had bought earlier in the summer. they did not have my size in the style I wanted so the women specail ordered them for me. she thhen called me when thye came in. And if you did not know it is stotre policy to taylor all garments you buy free of charge. I will be getting some more suits soon.I'm not the biggest Thai food eater but this place was ok. It didn't really blow my mind. The pad-thai noodles with shrimp, #5 in spicy-ness was good and the green curry with beef, #7 in spicy-ness was not too spicy and I was slightly disappointed. I like the fact that it's close by and I loved their Thai tea. 

The service was good, they were friendly, and my water glass was always full. They also tried their best to seat everyone asap.If you read my other reviews you'll see that I'm a Thai food foodie. Whenever I travel I search Yelp for Thai restaurants in search of great Thai food. So, keep in mind that I'm comparing this place with some of my favorite restaurants. 

This place has fast service.  My cachew chicken was brought out in under 5 minutes, hot and with a generous serving of sticky rice. I ordered medium spicy and it was about a two on a scale of five. 

I would rate the flavor three out of five. I've had better and worse. 

I would recommend this place if you're hungry for Thai food and live nearby. 

This is my first review from Las Vegas, look for at least a couple more.Probably my first review of a major chain restaurant...meeting some family here, so didn't have a choice of location lol.

Been years since I have been to a Chili's, so can't say how it fares across board, but it is decent food at good prices here.  Probably more on the cheap end actually with those 2 for $20 deals.

Went with the baby backs, the more tangy sauce....the ribs were pretty tender, fairly easy to pull apart off the bone.  A good rib, just not a great rib.  I am getting spoiled with these more spendy BBQ places in town.

Tried the burger, again, decent but not great.  Same thing, becoming jaded with all the exceptional burger spots in town.

Had the jalapeno fries or whatever they call them as our app.  Not bad, wish they layered the cheese and goodies though, since all the fries on the bottom go naked.

Service was a little slow, but we had a big group, so I chalk it up to that.  Won't really ding them for that in our case.

Overall, this will be a good Chili's to attend, if you want Chili's.  Otherwise, keep searching Yelp for better craving reducers!This is my third or perhaps fourth Tony Roma's restaurants that I have been to around the world. It was way less crowded than the Bangkok location. Lighting seems brighter than the one in Fremont, CA, and I can't recall at all the location(s) of the other chain outposts I have been to.

The menu still have some of the regular old school items, but it has definitely been revamped in the last 6-8 years since I ate at a Tony Roma's. The Steak & Wild Mushroom Flatbread in the appetizer section and the Basil Pesto Mahi Mahi & Vegetable Linguine in the pasta section both look really good, which I have to try next time.

But here's my review on what I ordered for dinner on this visit:

I was craving the Original Back Ribs with the TR's Original BBQ Sauce, which came with cole slaw and I opted for the loaded mashed potato as the other side item.  It came out of the kitchen before I could finished reading a page out of a book I brought with me.  Was told it was because they were slow.  So who knows how long it has been waiting in the kitchen to be served.  The full slab of ribs looks kind of small, it didn't even cover the length of the oval plate, and I knew I would have to order more food.  The flavor was good, but the ribs didn't match my fond memories of it.  Ellis Island's ribs is definitely the way to go for me while I am in Vegas.  (ribs 2.5-3 stars)

Ordered a Chopped Wedge Salad after the ribs arrived, and as simple as it was, it was a highlight of the dining experience (the rice pilaf was the other - crazy! I know).  (4 stars!)

From the Seafood section I ordered the Norwegian Salmon Pan Seared with Sesame Crust and finished with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. It was served with great rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  The fish was prepared well, but it would have been better if it was not cooked all the way through.  (3 stars) The best part of this item is your ability to customize your salmon or mahi mahi and the cooking method and finishing options.

Service was friendly, and attentive.  There were only 3 tables my waiter was responsible for, and only 2 at the most were in the restaurant at the same time, so it wasn't hard to check up on the guests and bring refills.

They also have a full bar, but I didn't order anything interesting from them.

Ambiance/Decor: 3/5  Had some pictures and such as wall decoration, the lighting at the booth were fairly bright which I like for taking food pictures, and music playing in the background.  Nice feel but nothing special.

Service:  4/5  Pleasant.

Food:  3/5  Portion is noticeably smaller with the ribs, flavor still the same, but the salad was refreshing and tasty.

Price:  3/5  Comparable to other casual dining competitions, and has options that will meet the needs of those on a modest budget (under $15/person) and others that can slightly splurge a little more.

During lunch they have the 7 for $7 promotion, and their happy hours are from 3pm to 7pm and also from 9pm to close.

Location:  West.  Not at all close to the Strip, so it is for locals.

Parking:  Plenty to select from, as it is in a large strip mall complex with several large national retailers such as Best Buy.

3 stars!  But the ribs will no longer be the reason for my future visits.Tony Roma's used to be one of my favorite spots as a teenager. Oh nostalgia...Where has the time gone? 

Unfortunately, a lot has changed for this restaurant since then, specifically now with their raised prices and smaller portions. Oh and can I mention that they don't offer the 4 different bbq sauces on the tables anymore? Just more of an inconvenience to have to ask the servers for it. I guess they're really trying to save costs, huh?

I came here last night and ordered the full slab of baby back ribs with a side of baked potato and rice (It's the only item that I order every time I dine here). Their baby back ribs glazed with their bbq sauce are freakin good and has always been freakin good. The ribs are so tender and juicy. However, I feel like their portions have been gradually decreasing over the years. And I'm confident to say that two full slabs today would make up a full slab back in the day along with cheaper prices. 

Sadly, due to a lot of their changes, I think they lost a lot of business. However, if I'm really craving baby back ribs which isn't very often these days, I will most likely end up coming back here.I only am giving three stars because I ah-dore the Great White shark hanging from the ceiling and their extensive line of witty teeshirt (crabs?). Otherwise, my first, and probably last visit to Joe's was nothing but a vibrantly colored-glorified Red Lobster.

I was super excited to go because, ahem!, I like to eat crab and the place looks funfully inviting. AND IT IS (again, super witty tees)! I enjoy the colors, I enjoy the "wharfy" planks I had to carefully walk over in my stilettos, and hello? the commercials are pretty catchy, too.

Amber was a sweetheart. She grabbed a shark toy (cocktail flare) to give to my 2 year old nephew, gave her feedback on menu items, was bubbly, and thought everything we were ordering was delicious! I like her.

The calamari was boring and boring. My kid and I love calamari but this wasn't it. I'm pretty sure it was served with marinara sauce, not cocktail (where's the bit o' kick?). My....(wait, what did I order?)...oh yeah! My crab cake sandwich DID SAY it was served on an english muffin. Never before have I been so put off with consuming an english muffin - room temp, white, bleh. Tomato slice and shredded lettuce on the side. Some remoulade sauce (which I used to slather into my sandwich) was the hit the plate. My daughter got the crab nachos. They were yummy the next day. Sis-in-law had coconut shrimp & fries. I think she ate it. I had one and it was pretty good. But can you ever go wrong with coconut shrimp? IDK? 

In all, I'm pretty sure I won't be back to a Joe's Crab Shack. Okay, okay, maybe to grab a witty teeshirt.CLOSED-CLOSED-CLOSED

Too bad because I loved this place. It had the best Chinese food I'd found in this city since I've been here. 

Sadly, they have gone out of business.Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants.  I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them.   Everything is just ok.  Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.

I found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.  

The service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.

So over all, the food was good, the service was great, but I am still bored with the overall place.  Give me Chili's anyday, but this Applebee's did a good job today.  Way to go Applebee's for slowing changing my opinion about you.I went out with the hubbi this eve. Well I will say it could be better but it's just your typical random Applebee's ...ahhh...they didn't fix my drink right. In my Sir Charles Barkley voice it was terrible. Then I sent that back the first drink & took a picture of the 2nd drink. The over all service was two star worthy. But I'm feeling gracious tonight so a 3 is what I will give them. Should u view my pictures you will see I had shrimp & salad. Will I return hmmmm I guess. (Rolls my eyes) they could have done better.AMBIANCE: 3 - Regular. I mean, it's Applebee's! It actually feels a bit cramped on the upper levels. 

SERVICE: 4 - Excellent. Our server was very helpful and funny. She was attentive and polite. It was exactly how a server should be! I know it was slow, but she checked on us way too much! 

FOOD: 3 - It's true, there are big deals here and real money to be saved! They even revamped their entire menu, and I got the steak on the 2 for 25 deal (including appetizer), but I have to be honest, it wasn't good. The food at this Applebee's has just deteriorated over the years and become painfully average. Though my mom did order the strawberry avocado salad, which was probably the best thing on the menu! 

The only reason I like coming to this Applebee's location is because of their happy hour (big drinks at $5-6, I think) and they've always had a great bartender that works there! My favorite Long Island comes out of this Applebee's! 

So my final advice, when you're at Applebee's, (I think you know it!) "a happy hour is a happy day!"Came here for a dat night with the hubby.

The service was okay. Guy was friendly but didn't really go out of his way. He did a great job at explaining a couple items for us.

I love that you can write on the table (its paper and i had a pen) Lol..

The food was good. Nothing to write home about. It hit the spot cause i hadnt had italian in a while. 

The place was full but you didnt have to wait to get a seat.

A bit pricey for what it is. I enjoy olive garden betterThis was my first visit to this location as it is now known as Griddle Cakes. I had been many times before to the Kountry Kafe. Yelp says they open at 9:00, but they actually open at 7:00. Empty upon our arrival, it did get a little busier as time went on. I got the Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and home fries. I substituted a pancake for the toast for additional charge of $1.00. The pancake was outstanding and worth the extra charge. The CFS itself was very good. Nice and tender with plenty of flavor. The eggs and home fries were average, as was the coffee. I was not impressed with the orange juice. It seemed like Tang with pulp added. The waitress was pleasant and attentive, keeping the coffee cups full. A decent place for breakfast and one that I will visit again.Its cool.. 24hr drive-thru tho lolFood was pretty good, it's something you always know what to expect for taste.

Julie was our waitress, she was very prompt and managed her busy section well.

I wish the loud mouth male stripper behind us would have shut up or at least lowered his voice and kept his f-bombs to himself. Not everyone cares to know you learned so many moves from magic mike. PS you're not going to get famous being a male stripper at some low budget club. Yea I heard every word you said. PSS don't bank with wells fargo, they suck.

I had to red velvet pancakes, they were sub par compared to babystacks! 

Return factor: meh, maybe...just maybe.We've been stopping by here once or twice a year for the past eight years or so.  I'm giving up one of my best kept secrets by saying this, but I've picked up many a great cookbook here on the cheap.  

Customer service can be a little terse - but hey, I'll take a Mom 'n' Pop with a little curmudgeonly character over a chain store manned by bubbly Barbie's any day!Always a fan of the breadsticks and salad. The Gluten free menu as far as my gluten free friend was concerned felt it only rated a 3 for choices.  There are @ least 6 dishes to choose from but they only came with penne pasta. She felt there needed to be more choices of gluten pasta to choose from.I would like to give this place a better review, however, I can't do to inconsistency. 

Two years ago, this was in the top 15% of the best Oriental Buffets, in Las Vegas. Sometimes I go here and things are fresh and tasty. Other times I am disappointed. 

I don't know for sure, but I suspect that the restaurant uses MSG in their food.

The atmosphere is basic.... 

I also think they could do a better job with making the place feel cleaner. Nothing bad... just needs the attention to finer details to push it up a notch.

The price is reasonable and the service is acceptable.

Overall, not a bad deal if you are hungry.First and foremost, Wal Mart is the place to be when there are those nights where you have nothing to do, and you are thinking of somewhere to go and something to snack on.  The Wal Mart on this side of town though, is open 24 hours, but I dislike the whole parking lot situation! The lot is not at all organized, and there are not any stop signs where there needs to be! People zoom in and out of here, so if you are ever dying to go on a whimsical trip to Wal Mart on Nellis, please proceed with caution!It was the first time I ever came to this location, and not gonna lie, it smelled like sewer! Bad day, perhaps? But oh well, it's KFC and I love me some fried chicken.I didn't eat at the restaurant, we did the carside to go instead. The order process was good and the server that took my order was very efficient. The food came out hot and straight to my car which was super convenient. The whole Carside to go option is fabulous.Regular bar to drink a beer and catch a game, I was there for a Monday night game.

The service was not great, since they were all taking care of a large group of men, about 25 mainly the military look, probably from Nellis AF.

i've been to may breweries in my day and this was not impressive would not make it in Portland OR, I ordered the IPA and their version of a Stout and they both came up short.
Could be done better, but earns a star for being just 2 blocks away from my house!

I'll try the root beer next.Yes, I know its Domino's, and I know there are better pizza places in town. However, when I want cheap, good, and fast delivery pizza, I call my neighborhood Domino's. I wasn't a huge fan of Domino's until they went through the whole ordeal where they changed their sauce, crust, ingredients etc after much public outcry (I didn't hear it, but it must have been crazy :-P ). I only really ate it in a pinch. Our typical order is thin crust with either white sauce, feta and onions, or some variety of veggies with red sauce. When we get the pizza, it always looks appetizing. I can't say this even for the more "fancier" pizza joints. Additionally, the delivery is always within 30-45 minutes, which is not the case for other places, even ones that are much closer to us. The ingredients are fresh, and the crust is usually very crispy but not hard. 
I will also say that my most favorite thing about Domino's is the Noid...wait, wrong decade, its actually the online ordering. Domino's order tracker is very cool, its accurate and sometimes I just watch it while I am waiting for my pizza.Roberto's is my greasy fast food Mexican spot of choice in the area, but every once in a while I have a hankering for something different and that's when Felipito's comes in handy. Their food is ok, nothing spectacular but they have some different options like churros and other desserts to tempt the tastebuds. They have all the typical Mexican fare and it's all greasy and pretty tasty. I usually end up with a breakfast burrito or rolled tacos, which were a little crunchier than I would like but I enjoy their salsas quite a bit. 

They have a drive thru which is the main attraction for me. It's attached to a gas station and 7-11, which also makes for a convenient spot to pick up grub while running other errands or picking other snacks we might need.With my dad being a chef, we come here every once in a while to get equipment. Sometimes we just buy stuff for the house. The prices are decent. There is an additional discount for being a union member. It is nothing large, but substantial enough to cover the sales tax. There are some great finds in here. Not everything is going to be able to purchase for residential use. Most of it is for commercial.The bbq here is pretty good.  It isn't anything to write home about, but it certainly is worth a stop.  Down sides, it has a very chain feel to it, and there isn't much for a spicy selection.Great service and the food was amazing for the price. Close to base which is great for a quick lunch. I had the king which was delicious and topped it off with an apple sweet tea! Nice selection of meals!Gay country-western bar?  YES please!

Charlie's is a good time for some off-strip gay time wile visiting Vegas.  Only a block or so from the Orleans (I always cab here because it's easier than trying to explain the address to the cabbie.)  

The only drawback I've found is that it often feels like Charlie's is a "starter bar."  I think people come here to drink first before heading out elsewhere, as we've often found it almost entirely empty at 11pm on a Friday or Saturday.

Great bartenders, though!  Always include a stop here when visiting Vegas.Sunday Nights are the best time to go.Came here yesterday afternoon and it was chilled out. Mixed crowd mostly 30 and up. the waitress was friendly. $2.00 miller lite draft 16 oz. 
Kinda smoky though.. lucky for me I was sitting nxt to the guy smoking Marlboro reds. the only one in the bar smoking what smelled like unfiltered and pleastly blowing his excess smoke in my face. how lucky am I?? 
We had one beer ea. and left. They had plent of tvs and this place was much larger than it appeared from outside. 
What I liked most was this was game 1 of world series and there was volume!!! AND best part about this place is they have those lil boxes that you can put beside you that gives you individual volume if you're watching a different game other than what' the main bar's volume is on. I LOVE THAT! 
I didnt order any food but there was a few families on the food side. This place was pretty full for being 4 pm on a weekday. I'd def. come bk.Ive only been here once and went to have dinner on the lefthand side of htis place. its a mini casino. its smaller than it looks from the outside b/c it looks like this place used to have a movie theatre attached to it @ one point. 
DINNER: all of us ordered the burger special that comes w/ a draft beer (obviously b/c this is a brewery all the beers are made there) I'm usually not much for anything but pale ales but I went w/ the hef this time and it ok but w/e my bf ordered was even better. i wantt o say that was the blue diamond, if memory serves correctly. W/e it was there were signs all over the walls advertising its various awards, winnings and certificates for being an awesome beer. 
the burger was great. I do remember however being torn btwn gettng the salad bar & the burger but after looking @ its 8 pm slim pickins I decided on the burger & beer.  How can you go wrong w/ that for $9.99? 

I havnet come to sit @ the bar yet but I've wanted to on many occasions.. . maybe here in a few. 
I did see someone win big on the wizard of oz game and i remember thinking damn, she took my machine. . . lol. 
I'd come back again and try my luck, see if I can win big.YIKES!  I just read the other reviews for this place and they sound terrifying!!!!  I fortunatly have not had those issues.  The pizza it okay.  It's nothing spectacular and I would say it's a step above frozen pizza.  Since I'm a student at CSN, I get 50% off.  I've been here twice and done take out both times and I haven't had any issues.This used to be one of our favorite spots to frequent but, the last two times they fell short of the greatness of the first few times that we went... a dozen tostada with beans and salsa, when hot, are to die for.... Their "lite and healthy" menu all have been great in the past... I hope that they return to their top quality of food and service soon.Can't beat the prices here.  Love the chips and salsa.  Margarita's are good.  Always get seated right away.  Refies are just okay.  Always friendly service.We really like Super Mex.  It has pretty decent Tex Mex offerings and a pretty large menu.  They even have a discounted and a "lite" menu, for even more options.  You are bound to find something you like here.

We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.

Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!

On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!

The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.

So see you at Super Mex.  I will be the one stuffing my face with a chimichanga!Small little place. Would have never thought to come here if my classmates didn't drag me there on our break between classes. Huge portions for the price you pay. Food tastes okay. Ordered the Kung Pap Shrimp & only got like 7 pieces and the rest was vegetables which was pretty disappointing. Overall okay food. Will probably be back if I'm craving Chinese food while at school.I eat here a few times a month and since the drive thru kept dumping my drink on me (twice in a month) I started going inside where the service is top notch. Of course today was the first trip to the bathroom where I discovered no paper towels (airblowers) but since I was there to blow my nose. I used a napkin and found no trash can. Im sure thats a price saving measure but I still believe you should have one or you will find all kinds of foreign objects being flushed down the drain. Just a thought guys. Just a thought.I love albertsons! Specially this one because it's literally 2 minutes away from me. even tho it's a little ghetto and you get harass by panhandlers. you don't need a albertson card. Everyone gets the discount now. 
We always buy our proteins here instead of wallly world. I love interacting with my butcher and knowing it's fresh meat & seafood. 
staff can be weird sometimes but never rude. they also have in store security because it's in the hood lol. try out their bone in ribeyes, salmon filets and scallops!Longhorn Cafe in East Las Vegas is a DIve Casino with OLD Las Vegas prices!! 

24/7 specials include $3.99 Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, $4.99 Steak & Eggs and more.

Casino & Cafe connected to a Super 8 on Boulder Highway!

Steak is cheap but gristly ,coffee is good and slots are friendly.EASTside locals Favorite!It's a very small restaurant in a very old and small casino. I would recommend going to the bathroom at home before coming. Also if your allergic to second hand smoke I wouldn't recommend this place unless you wear an oxygen mask or take a couple benadryl. With all that said this place has the best chicken fried steak in Vegas/Henderson.I've been to many places here and so far this is the best. The rating I'm giving it is for the chicken fried steak. The place is a dump but worth it for this meal alone.Well u get what u paid for - I'm glad I wasn't paying and I'm glad I gotten a side of fries since I wasn't really hungry which was $1.99.

Now on the other hand my friend gotta the NEW YORK STEAK & LOBSTER TAIL for $9.99 - ok presentation it looked good but it was just OK.  It came with a baked potato, large dinner roll, and nasty green beans.

*Remember anything extra cost


Side note = they have a MONSTER burger which is 1lb of meat.Located on the lovely stretch of road known as Boulder Hwy., this Denny's is fondly known to my friends and I as Beer Denny's.  If we're feeling' especially white trash, we'll show up here for a 3 PM breakfast accompanied by a Bud Light. 

The service is usually slow, the food is just Denny's food, but the fact that this is a Beer Denny's makes it win just a little.I don't really have any gripes about this location. 

Everytime I order a "happy meal" they never correct me, simply give me what I want. I always feel a bit stupid afterwards but hey, it's an honest mistake.

They are pretty fast in the drive through and almost always clean on the inside. I always get please and thank you from the employees here too.Before the Sam's Town Live Wrestlemania showing, I got a taste of the Fireside Buffet. At $10.70 with the Boyd card, the Sunday Champagne Brunch was affordable and appetizing.

  At buffets, I am not big on the breakfast food. I loaded my plate with Asian food. Eating the Asian food, it tasted familiar. Then it dawned on me that this Asian food is similar to Main Street Station's buffet-a sister Boyd buffet that has been honored with Best Buffet of Vegas in the past.
 
  As a Yelper, I have observed that buffet quality changes faster than casino ownerships. Based on today and recent visits, I give Fireside Buffet 3 stars.Fine for what you pay, a fast food joint would cost more, there is an old guy Albert that goes here every day. The place is basically Country Kitchen buffet for the senior citizen locals. Since most tourists would never even go to Boulder Highway.Saturday night special buffet for $9.99 a person. The ribeye steak was good and so was the baked potato bar with all the fixing, though not sure why horseradish sauce is part of the potato bar, hopefully someone likes horseradish sauce on a potato. The Asian food section was also good, while the fried rice didn't look appetizing it was good and so was the chow mien and broccoli beef. I didn't try the Mexican food section it looked completely unappetizing and they used ground beef for tacos? Maybe with some steak this section would be better. The fried chicken was also good and tasty, crispy and done just right. While I didn't personally try the top sirloin my kids assured me they loved it, as they ate two steaks of well cooked meat. Also, I was told the ice cream was delicious.So don't judge me but I have never in life had Little Caesars Pizza until recently.

I will say that I definitely wasn't missing out on anything big or grand. However, for $5 for a Hot & Ready Large Pepperoni Pizza it was a good deal.

The pizza itself had way more pepperoni on it than I thought it would. Definitely a lot of bread and not a super cheesy pizza, but for $5 I am not going to cry about it. It fed my family for dinner one night and at a great price if you ask me.

We also got a side of the cheesy bread sticks and those were pretty good. 

The location itself is pretty busy, so the parking lot can sometimes be tight. And you are bound to see some interesting characters.Century 18 Sam's town is one of the closest theaters to my home aside from Boulder Station's regal theater which is of equal distance. The movies here are sometimes not with Regal and vice versa so either way we're coming here as well.

The Workers here are nice, just wish sometimes they would smile, but i can't really complain, perhaps theyre just sad that day or upset. On Non busy days or during the start of the week, the theater is pretty much dead. Hardly any movie goers, at least during matinee i notice. So everything is clean and everything is neat which is nice. On Fridays or weekends i can see a little more action here, still not too hectic which i like as well.

The auditoriums are clean and well maintained, sound is good, the screens are in ok condition. In a few auditoriums, on the screen, i see lines running from left to right as there's probably a fold or something in the screen. Doesn't get in the way of the movie but you may see it while watching.

Overall A-OK not the best theater out there, but somewhere to go. Typical prices on tickets and food, can't complain. Good customer service and well maintained auditoriums.Decent fast food Chinese food. It's close to the house for those I don't want to cook kind of nights. I will go back since the food is always good at this location.Von is always annoying to use online printed coupons. They always give me a hard time or they won't take it if it's not printed in full color. The food here is also expensive. But I like the fact they sale carvel ice cream cakes here and that's about it. For the price of food from Von I rather go to Trader Joe's.They do a good job, just very very expensive!!!Eh.  It's OK.  It's not Nora's.

We went here because we had a gift certificate and I had heard some buzz about the place.  What stands out the most was that this ITALIAN place had entrees that weren't Italian!  They had a Hawaiian dish special and an Asian special.  I don't know why, but I really hate it when you go to a restaurant and they have food that doesn't fit their theme!  Maybe it's a bias I hold.

I ordered the penne alla vodka and my husband ordered linguine with clams.  The food was all right.  Nothing spectacular.  And the prices were a bit high.

Bottom line: I wouldn't go back.Grape street is visually inviting, the bar is pretty and it looks like a wine cellar, the food I would have to say is sub par. The first time I ate there, I went only because it came highly recommended. My first experience did not impress me much. I had a chicken pasta that was just ok, I'm not a big salt lover and I had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor. I did go back to Grape Street, but not because I was dying to try again, my dad had a groupon and invited me to lunch, otherwise I can honestly say I I wouldn't have returned. I ordered the same chicken pasta I had my first visit. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and would explain my three star rating. The pasta was good this time around and had enough flavor that I didn't have to add any salt to make it edible. Aside from the ok food I would say the service was prompt and efficient. If you want the best Italian food just go up the street to Parma, which is miles superior.The wine selection is very good and the wine flights are a good pour for the value. The fruit and cheese plate leaves a lot to be desired, it was simply four thin slices of un named cheese with an abundance of bread slices and crackers and some unevenly matched fruit slices. The calamari was decent but a small portion. Their bread they give you when you are seated is wonderful. The restaurant was dark and cluttered and the large cast iron chairs were hard to manage. Also, listening to a female waitstaff talk about her tips behind the wine and faux brick wall area when you still have customers in the restaurant is so tacky.  All in all I would stop off for a wine flight and the bread but not much else.Came here because I am the Groupon queen to test out their wine flight and tapas plate for two. I ordered the interesting wine flight but I wish I had tried the international wine flight. The tapas plate had meatballs, goat cheese cigars, eggplant, kalamata olives, satziki sauce, and bread. The meatballs were in a hearty and spicy sauce which we really enjoyed. The satziki sauce was loaded with dill and I really liked it. Service was quick and friendly. The hostesses were very rarely at their station and when a senile and possibly homeless lady wandered in, she was able to roam around freely, muttering to herself  in the restaurant which I found alarming. I also found it that the menu was just a tad overpriced for the location (in a strip mall) and for what you are getting.I can sort of understand why this Trader Joe's is always a madhouse. If you live in the Northwest your options for organic, vegetarian or any non-standard grocery items is limited. With Fresh&Easy's likely going out of business soon, I don't doubt the revenue of this store will get a boost, but the shopping experience will continue to be a headache.

It's your standard Trader Joe's, which is above average when it comes to the grocery stores experience. Something about the layout is off to me, but I think I'm just really used to the one in Henderson. Nonetheless, they are always well-stocked, even when I went the day before Thanksgiving out of pure desperation. The staff is nice and helpful; they take customer service seriously even when the place is a zoo.

Trader Joe's are small, they just are. And this one is always packed to the brim, the parking lot is like an obstacle course and the patrons are just a little more pushy than the average TJ patron. I get it, you folks are desperate for some organic leafy vegetables and antibiotic-free dairy. But good God, let's be kind to one another! I've never had my basket bumped or been cut in front of so many times in one trip! I know TJ's can't control this, but the wildness of the store really deflates the shopping experience.

Good TJ's, crazy customers.This location of Jimmy John's is a regular lunch stop when I am working in the Northwest. Clean shop, friendly staff, quick service.

I love turkey, I don't like ham or super salty meats (read: Italian meats) on my sandwiches (except bacon of course!). Jimmy John's has a nice selection of sandwiches with turkey on them. Here are my faves:

Turkey Tom - simple...turkey, cheese, regular fixins
Beach Club - turkey, cheese, avo, cukes, sprouts...a California Girl's sandwich dream
Club Lulu - turkey, bacon, regular fixins
Bootlegger - turkey, roast beef, regular fixins

Fresh ingredients, good portion of meat (for me), lots of veggies, extra peppers please! Quality sandwich place.we ordered 3 sandwiches and we asked for the dressing on the side and they said they could not do that. they were not allowed to have dixie cups so they had to put it in a cup.This place is ok. Not too bad not too good. Sometimes u just get a craving for it. It's better than Capriotti's, or Jimmy John's. Not as good as Quiznos, or Jersey Mike's. About the same as Subway or Firehouse. I like that they slice the meats in front of you. That adds a nice touch. Everyone has always been super friendly. Even when I had my kids there, bouncing off the walls, the staff never gave me an evil eye, or even a bad comment. That makes them a 3.5 star, but u can't give half stars.THE PIZZA WAS SQUARE!! 
That's not really a problem LoL and the food is all good nasty junk food like you'd want from a place like this. Cool atmosphere for what it is too. 

Trans-friendly- yea sure. maybe a few customers would be dumb but the staff is very nice :)I started going to The Village Pub when I was a kid and my parents and I lived in Desert Shores back around 1996. The dinning area is small and most of the time there is a long wait. Last time we went they only had 1 server and it was the dinner rush time. The food is decent bar food. They have nightly specials and are decently priced. They have the 6oz filet, that my husband always gets, for around $9. The bar can get smokey and loud at times. We usually go to The Pub when we cant think of anywhere else to eat.For what it is, a neighborhood pub, it gets 5 stars; but it is a neighborhood pub and the food fits -- Had the chicken pot pie which is absolutely great. With that, I recommend it. I have had both breakfast and lunch there; both rank the same way. Worth a shot or two if you're in the neighborhood.My husband and I go to this place mostly for the monday special which is a half chicken dinner now priced at 7.49.   When it was 5.99 years ago, half of Sun City were lining up out the doors.   Now I guess the place is just not as packed. 

We decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken.   However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu.   One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up.   These have certain items such as bacon, bleu cheese, jaleponos etc.      I just wanted a burger, medium rare with cheddar cheese and my husband just wanted it plain.   We asked what does it come with and it has a choice of steak fries, potato salad, coleslaw etc.      I failed to ask what also comes on the burger. 

When we got the burgers, I looked for the cheese and found a small melted quarter size spot on the burger, lettuce and two slices of tomato and a pickle on the side. 

The burger was slightly pink, I like it rarer, and was very thin although it was supposed to be 1/2 pound.   It was also VERY dry tasting.    

When we got the bill I asked the server, what happened to the cheese? She said she ordered it with cheese, but I couldn't even see 2 cents worth.    Then we saw we were charged 7.99 and 8.50.     She said because it came with lettuce and tomato, we were charged extra.   What a rip off!   Burger bun just okay.  will NEVER order a burger there again!I guess I got spoiled at the golds in Avondale,  AZ.  Every cardio machine there is new and has its own TV. This is my home gym now but I wish they remodeled and added new cardio and weight machines and according to my husband the men's room needs the type of cleaning that will get rid of the pee smell.

I've taken many of the cardio classes and most are great but it's hard to take a class serious when the instructor is over weight and lacks movement when teaching a zumba class. The instructors that teach body pump are all great. 

All in all its a dated gym that was wicked awesome many years ago when it first opened but it's in need of a face lift.Definitely a place for beer. The beer was really good and reasonably priced for microbrew. There was a good selection and you can sample before you order.

The food was ordinary. We had the hot wings, which were large and nicely spiced and came with a big scoop of cole slaw. We also had a ribeye steak which was fine, but not great. It came with mixed veggies which were both over and under cooked at the same time.

I used a restaurant.com gift certificate and including beer it was easy to spend the required $35. I would go back for the beer but I was not impressed by the food. There are so many better choices in Vegas.The staff was OK on our visit but really not all that helpful. When I picked up the glazed plate my son painted there were small holes in the glaze showing raw ceramic.

Would we go again? Possibly but we won't be rushing back.Just like any other walgreens, they're just Walgreens, nothing special. 
I do like they're little trinkets they sell.. =)First off, I can see why people think it is slow, but they also have a sign up saying you will be seen in order of priority. Therefore, if you are not gushing blood you can wait awhile.

My girl broke her wrist so we spend few hours here maybe two, but the nurses were nice to her and even offered to fill out all her paperwork for her since her wrist was broken. 

So I have to say that's good customer service. ;)I went here for a one time stop, & I hope I never have to come back. I passionately dislike hospitals. They give off a depressing feeling.

Cleanliness:

Hospitals are always clean, & they should stay that way.

Service(s):

The employees could be nicer, but they deal with different attitudes everyday, so I know where they're coming from.

They've got antibacterial wall dispensers which are a plus but probably more of a necessity.

The waiting time is pretty bad, and it didn't seem like there were a lot of people to wait on/for.

The doctor I had was nice and understanding. I'm glad she knew what was ailing me as I was describing my situation.


I wish they offered me a sticker..I had great hopes for Yummy based on the Yelp rating.  Unfortunately, I have to rate them as so-so...  I still believe Narita at Cheyenne & Tenaya is the best Sushi in the NW Las Vegas area.  Of course, my reference for all Sushi is Tsukiji market in Tokyo.UPDATE: You had me, Yummy. You had me at hello. We came back to you and you let us down. Now I look stupid talking about your generous portions of fish. I got literally the same things and the fish was cut half as thick, a third the length. Seriously?

From 4 stars down to 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------

What is this obsession with authenticity? Some people live and breathe on the notion that "authentic" is the only way. It is, to them, the bar with which all else is judged. I don't think that needs to be the case, really. If something is good, it's good. Right?

Yummy Grill is not authentic Japanese sushi. It is yet another Korean-style spot so common to Vegas. And yet so many people recommend it here boasting quality this and fish that. Ok, I give. And I'm glad I did. I don't think I've ever had larger cuts of fish than here. They're huge and delicious! Very good quality and well presented.

On the other hand, the sushi rice was poor. For selecting such fine pieces of fish to serve, why do the injustice of the crappy rice? It wasn't cooked correctly or seasoned correctly. They say the rice is 90% the goodness of any sushi. If that's true, I should change the rating to 2 stars instead. Serious imbalance. Maybe someone new made the rice and it was just an anomaly. Time will tell. Also, it took absolutely forever to get orders out to us.

With all that said, yes I'm sticking to 4/5 stars. I'd certainly be back. The quality and cuts of the fish alone is reason enough for me. What did I have, you ask?

- Smoked salmon nigiri. The smokiness was subtle and smooth, thankfully.
- Regular salmon nigiri
- Yellowtail nigiri
- Garlic tuna nigiri. The garlic portion was milder than I would have liked but it was fresh garlic grated into a bunch on top.
- Fatty tuna nigiri. Cut in an unusual "straight cut" way.
- Arizona roll
- Paradise roll
- Passion roll
- Last samurai
- Spicy yellowtail roll. Delightful crunch included from veggies!

Even though things got to us slowly, and the rice was less than stellar, everything was still delicious. Until next time...I know they're mostly for pool stuff but I don't have a pool. I don't know if most people know or not, but they have Christmas stuff during the holidays that is rather nice. 

I like their trees because they have ones that aren't the generic crinkly string type trees but they carry realistic trees of various breeds. If you have big trees or need lawn or huge blow up decor they have those too. 

They were pretty nice and helpful even though I was just looking at clearance Christmas stuff this visit. They opened up the trees that werent on display so we can see the bristles and color and answered out questions on lighting. We ended up getting a 7ft coastal fir tree for $100, LED bush net lights, and a dozen regular string lights. I went overboard with the lights on the tree but it definitely doesn't make my tree look generic. 

It's a bit hard for me to really give a review rating since I go for seasonal items and not their year round business, but this is definitely a good Christmas stop.

(Yelp 100 Challenge 2/100)I had high hopes for this place.  After reading the yelp reviews and online menu, I made a reservation for 4 for Friday night (3/11/2011).  My party was initially impressed with the lovely (man-made) lake view and the talented jazz guitarist/vocalist.  Unfortunately, our initial impression was marred by several factors:

1) we had a long wait for our dinner (45 min)
2) my order was incorrect
3) our blonde server was not really attentive (she did not ask us how our food was....she didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert order!)

On the plus side, the view is lovely.  My meal was complimentary due to the kitchen's error.  The food and wine were wonderful.  I would come here again to see if the service would be better.  For a first-time visit, however, this was a little disappointing, especially since the prices are on the expensive side.  Aren't pricier restaurants supposed to ensure quality of food AND service?  Marché Bacchus has a lot of potential for consistent 5-star ratings....y'all have the food, wine, and view part down....now, work on your wait staff!I really wanted to like this place. I have heard good things about it and it is one of the only "nice" restaurants in the Northwest but overall I was struggling to really "like it". I ultimately gave it a three based upon the food as that is what I primarily consider, I would provide it a four based on decor and ambiance.

First off, I really like the wine shop and they had some good wines at decent prices. Also, the $10 corkage fee is attractive and I like that you can buy a wine right there. We sat out on the patio, this too I liked. There was live music, a saxophonist, a little loud but still nice. It was a small little alcove next to the water which provided an intimate feel. The service was prompt and pleasant as well. 

We had the steak tar-tare appetizer, this was tasty. Also, I had the French Onion soup. I love French Onion soup and this was a nice surprise, probably my favorite part of the meal, light sherry undertone and very rich. I ordered the Risotto with truffles. Risotto was too al dente for my taste and was under-seasoned. The risotto was $18. I shared this entry with my husband who ordered the Lobster Pot Pie. The pot pie was also disappointing; they would have been well served to have called it Lobster stew. There was a good amount of lobster in the "pie", but there should be especially in light of the hefty $40 price tag. But the flavor was lacking and it was not rich and creamy but more soupy. We had the Lobster Pot Pie at Michael Mina in SF and it was phenomenal for about the same price or possibly even less. And don't get me wrong I have no qualms with spending money on a great meal, I will gladly do so, but I still like to review each meal on it's own and by comparison with other restaurants at similar price points. 

Our other dinner companion had the duck breast. I tried a piece of his and it was very moist and had a good flavor. Overall, nice decor and food was good, but not good enough for me to come running back here when there are so many other places in LV to try and not quite sure why they made it into the 50 essential restaurant book.The outside atmosphere and view of the lake were lovely. The wine shop well stocked with a nice variety and wide range of prices.
I had the escargot and was very disappointed. Very bland flavor lacking garlic and wine. The seared scallops were cooked perfectly and accompanying vegetables were sparse but tasty.
My son had the French Onion Soup, another big disappointment. The beef stock was too beefy and overbearing, almost had a tomato flavor (how they did that we can't figure out). The cheese was a weak gruyere, if it even was gruyere. His steak was served rare as asked for, but the sauce was a little runny and not what he expected. The bleu cheese was blended into the sauce and would have been better in visible chunks on the filet.
My husband was happy with the foie GRAS and with his duck.
But when the coffee came with half and half in tiny  pre-packaged containers, that did it. Where was the Creme? The menu is French influenced, but I have a hard time considering this a truly French restaurant.My wife asked me to go to Pep Boys today and pick up some mini fuses.

When I got there a kind of sketchy-looking lady in the parking lot asked if she could ask me a question. I said sure. She asked if I was going to buy anything and I said I was. She then told me that she had an $85 gift card but didn't need anything. She asked if she could buy my item with her gift card and then have me give her the cash. I agreed.

She thanked me for helping her and not looking at her weird for asking.

We then went inside and I told one of the workers what I needed. He led me over to the $5 pack of fuses I needed.

The lady looked disappointed and asked if that was all I was getting, and I told her it was. I apologized that I wasn't getting more than that.

Anyway, we checked out and the total came to $5.37. She paid with her gift card. I took out $5 and reached into my pocket to get the change. She told me not to worry about the change.

It was kind of an odd trip to Pep Boys, but I guess it worked out well for both of us.My Wednesday night hockey team's go-to dive bar after games. At Mulligans Landing we conduct our post-game interviews, meet and greets with fans, autograph signings, etc. In all seriousness, this place is a dive bar, but it is one that we hold close to heart. It's not a fancy bar. It could use a good cleaning, but the customer service is spectacular.How is it that I am just now getting around to reviewing John Mull's?  Oh yeah, because I just could not decide on 3 stars or 4.  I am going to go with a 3 star rating because this place I found to be average.  It took me a while to actually get here because they close so doggone early.  They close at 6:00 and I don't usually make it to the area from work until nearing 6:00.  So I usally have to bypass it.  And Saturdays are just too busy.  Sundays they are closed.  I did make it in one time though right before closing time.  I placed my order for a plate of brisket with baked beans and macaroni salad.  The beans were good but not extraordinary.  The macaroni salad was really good.  I am not alway a fan of macaroni salad but I ate this and wanted more.  As for the meat of the plate, the brisket itself, it was good.  Tender.  Flavorful.  They gave me a pile of it on top of a dinner roll.  I was disappointed that it did not come with BBQ sauce.  I came home and put some sauce from The Bear Pit (see review) on it.  That made it so much better.  I saved some of the meat for the next day.  There was that much of it.  With the amount of food I received, I felt the price was fair.  The reason they don't get a 4 star rating from me is the operating hours (which I understand and respect given they are in a residential neighborhood).  And the food, while good, it not amazing.  I would like to go back and get some of the fresh meat (uncooked) from their butcher side of business.As someone from the south, the Las Vegas BBQ scene has always been a source of disappointment. Most BBQ places are comically bad, both in terms of the meat itself and oftentimes more so in terms of the sides. So I went to the Road Kill Grill with pretty low expectations. 

My expectations were greatly exceeded- the food here is definitely passable and I think this place more than earns its "best vegas BBQ" reputation. Before I get to the pros let me explain quickly why I took off two stars:

1. Only outdoor seating. In Vegas. Let me tell you something about the average BBQ eater- they are fat people. When its 100 degrees outside they go into hibernation like a grizzly bear. They don't want to sit outside when eating their BBQ.

2. The service was pretty slow. There were only 3 people in front of me when I got in line and getting the food still took about 25 minutes. I don't mind a wait, especially when the food is good, but this delay was clearly due to under staffing/inexperience as all the food was ready it just needed to be dished out more efficiently. The design of their service line leaves much to be desired- a little rearranging so that more than 1 person could get involved and this problem would be instantly solved/service would speed up 10x. 


The food

I got a 3 meat plate. The highlight was definitely the sausage in BBQ sauce which was very flavorful. The ribs were definitely a little on the dry side but still quite good for Vegas. The brisket sits in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a little tough/needed to be slow cooked longer. The mac and cheese was very decent but the baked beans were way to vinegary for my taste.

I will definitely be going back, although maybe in winter, and checking out the butcher products as well.This was actually recommended to us by the Food Network on Diners, Drive Ins, & dive. . The food was pretty good I had the pulled pork. I ordered a 2 meat combo with the ribs & chicken. The sides were okay I don't really care for baked beans so I ordered some mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was very delicious. The pulled pork could have used a little bit more sauce but it was very tender and delicious. The chicken wasn't that great it was lacking flavor may be my personal preference. The ribs were very delicious I would definitely recommend going there. The staff is the reason why I gave it a 3 they are very unfriendly but I am sure it can be due to the high heat that they have to withstand waiting outside to take your order . It can get very very hot in Vegas so I would probably be cranky too working in hundred degree weather waiting for people to order food. If you're tired of the buffets in Vegas this is definitely worth the drive to head out for some BBQ .I have eaten here probably three time total. What I do like about this place is the quality. The hamburger patties actually taste like ground beef. The service is pretty good. A burger and some fries about $10-12 bucks. I can easily power down a meal here and not be completely full. Not a bad place I just think they are a little chintzy on the portions.  How about some more fries of something?We were out in the Northwest on our haunted house expedition, and decided to stop in because we hadn't been here in years. It was kind of late so the restaurant area was closed. I HATE sitting at barstools, but they had this weird sort of option of sitting on really tall padded benches against the wall. Slightly more comfortable, but the Anaconda said he felt like a little kid with his feet dangling.

Got the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato waffle fries. Burger was well cooked and tasty, and the hot, crispy fries came with a thin, sweet dipping sauce that went perfectly. Baby Sis got a house specialty sandwich with bratwurst. She said it was good but I can't personally attest since I didn't actually get a bite. She never was good at sharing.

Service was fine- friendly staff who seemed a little overworked. Pleasant vibe- they played a lot of classic rock mixed with country hits which seemed to cover the customer base pretty well. (About half of which were chatting and happy while the others were hunched over the video poker machines in their own private hell. I feel your pain.)

Now for the part that, for me, lost them their fourth star, but ironically, made the Anaconda and Baby Sis want to give them 5: they let you smoke at the #@$! table! WTF!  Am I the only one who recalls a law passed not that long ago that prohibited smoking in food service areas? What the hell ever happened to that??!! 

They sat there dreamily puffing away, declaring that it was such a treat not to have to go outside for their post-meal coffin nails, that this was their new favorite restaurant. I wanted to call the police.Went to this store for first couple years living here but have changed to cleaner, better priced stores that have come up.  They are very particular about their bulletin board, and the tack is pretty scarce except for basics like lead lines or halters. They have refused to take coupons from me for Purina, or charged me extra to take a coupon (?!?). The guys in the back are nice for hauling big bags of feed for you. Sometimes they actually recognize you and say HI as if they know you, which is about the only reason I'll go there. Pet supplies are overpriced. Good stop on the way home for milk or beer, quick bag of feed, but can't say I am treated well enough to make them my # 1.This is a very odd setup store, but somehow it makes sense. It's sharing a lot with gas pumps and inside there are some basic snacks and things for the gas station, then they carry equestrian items like meds, feed, reins, etc, hay in the back of the building, some cat and dog food. 

I came here because I was doing some research on dog foods that my one yeast sensitive dog can have and one is Earthborn...it's not carried at many places, but oddly was carried here? So hald of the selection is stuff you can find at a big box store, like Iams but then they also had some decent brands like Canidae, Earthborn, Diamond Naturals, Taste of the Wild, etc. 

The prices weren't hiked up much so I think it would be okay to buy here some dog stuff. There were sales on some of the bags event. Still, I can't say it's anywhere preferred for all their needs, however I will be rotating some Earthborn and grabbing it here to keep their diet interesting. 

I didn't look too much at the horse thing and this is a feed and tack store mostly, but they seem to have decent variety of needs met.5 star car wash, expensive gas, horrible wait time at the lube especially if you want a smog check. There is a McD inside which is a plus. Just ok.The Cheyenne's been around for a while now.  At first it was mainly a country and western bar and restaurant.  I remember my friend dragging me here when I was 14, kinda goth, and she wanted me to learn line dancing.  Oh, that was mortifying.  Hilarious in retrospect, mortifying in the moment.

Now it serves as mainly just a bar and music venue.  For a small local place, the stage ain't too bad.  For the type of music they bring in (X107.5ish sounding stuff, for the most part) they do a good job, although if you're not into it I doubt you'd stay long.  

Service tends to be quick even if the bar's packed and the prices are reasonable.

I come out to see my friends' bands and that's pretty much all that would get me out there.The Cheyenne is definitely way out there - in the northern part of Vegas.  We found ourselves here because of a local band playing - The Day After.  Cover charge was $10, which was a bit steep for a dive bar.  (I think they had a major act coming up, but we didn't stay for it.) 

Tons of parking here, a pretty long bar to work with, and a few pool tables that occupy the space as well.  Walk down a step and there's a dance floor in front of the stage.  More of a place for bands to perform than anything.  And yes, it can be deafening here.

Prices could be cheaper - $6 for a whiskey and water.  I didn't really peruse the drink selection, but another friend wasn't too impressed with their well drink choices.

Women's bathrooms were surprisingly clean - well lighted with toilet seat covers, toilet paper, hand soap and hand towels.

You'll probably only come if there's a band you've been watching out for.While I am not too big a fan of the dive bar scene, this is a good place to catch a local show.  A friend's hubby is in a band, and they frequently perform here, so I came here for two of his shows.  

Wow, this bar is roomy!  I am used to cramped dive bars, but this place is quite large, with lots of room even away from the "concert floor".  They have a couple pool tables and a couple of arcade games, though those tend to be blocked by an engineering booth during live shows.  There is a pit in front of the stage which acts as a concert floor.   I can't comment on the drinks since both times I came I was a sober driver.

The sound is crisp and clear, and while it is a smaller music venue the audio never feels like it's going to blow your eardrums to South America.  If you stand near the bar or pool tables, you can even have a reasonably audible conversation.  Shows do have cover, but the prices are very reasonable, and you can often get presale tickets for less if you know anyone in the bands.

I do have one large pet peeve with shows in this venue: they never start on time!  They go by what I have effectively dubbed "Cheyenne Saloon time", in that all shows start one hour AFTER their scheduled start time.  The second time I came here, my friend's band was third on the lineup, and the first band started just after 10 PM.  They eventually went on at like 1 in the morning, and by then we were all burnt out and just wanted to go home (the second band was awful, and were on stage for about an hour compared to most other bands who play for around 30 mins).  Please start on time!

Secondly, since I wasn't drinking alcohol, I wanted an energy drink.  They didn't have Red Bull, but they had some generic brand that I never heard of.  The can still cost five or six bucks!  Are you kidding me?  Some of the domestic beer costs less than that, and it's not even Red Bull!  Non-alcoholic drinks SHOULD NOT cost as much as an import brew.  Makes it harder to want to be a DD, le sigh.

By the way, someone scratched a passage from the Book of Revelation in the bathroom, and it's filled with typos.  That's annoying to this English major, so fix it!

Personally, I don't like watching concerts in bars, preferring an exclusively music venue like The Farm, but it still is a good place to catch a show, and I will probably find myself coming here again for other shows.

PROS:
Big and roomy for a dive bar
Clear audio that doesn't sound too loud or distorted.  
Good setup for shows

CONS:
Generic energy drinks are pricey for this DD!
You'll come out smelling like a human sized Malboro
Shows start late!  

THE VERDICT:  Good live music venue, but not a favorite of mine.  I'll occasionally come back.Since this place is so close to my house, it's usually where we go for movies. It's not the most posh place to catch a flick, but it serves the purpose. They have stadium seating, although the theater sizes vary within. I never understand why the snack bar only ever has one side open. I've been there when there were lines and lines of people and still only one side of the snack bar was open. This is so frustrating given the fact that I'm about to spend $30 on popcorn and drinks for the family. The staff are usually very friendly.It is McDonald's what else can you say.You have to like bus tours to appreciate how much this company tries to make you happy.

Prices: Internet special is $169.99 for 2.

Morning pick-up: 6:20 am at the west wing of the MGM Grand. They schedule small groups to be picked up at their hotels and shuffle them over to the Planet Hollywood terminal for registration. 

Breakfast: 1 meal ticket gets you 1 breakfast item/1 drink

Schedule: Each person is given a bus number and brightly colored tag so you won't have any issues. 

Stops: 45mins: Hoover Dam (10 minutes) 1 hr 20mins: Kingman, AZ (15 minutes) and everyone runs to the bathroom. 1hr. 30mins: Williams, AZ (45 minute Lunch) 1hr. 20 mins: South Rim, Grand Canyon.
The return trip is similar minus the stop in Williams, AZ.

Restroom Tip: Wait until your stop in Williams, AZ and go before you eat lunch. While everyone is running to the food, you won't have to wait in line for the food or the restroom.

Meals: Breakfast was okay, nothing spectacular. I had Apple juice and doughnuts but there are healthier alternatives like a nutrigrain bar. Lunch, if you think about it, it's quite good. Unlike other tour groups that hand over a cold sandwich box, Grand Canyon Tours offers a buffet style sit-down lunch. Great for kids! There are 2 or 3 choices for main dishes and all the fixings...even a salad and soup bar and a soft serve station. 

Time at the Grand Canyon: Not enough to some extent and you feel rushed at times to hike to the canyon. My group had 2 young children and a senior citizen. You really don't have time to just take it all in.

Fun things to do: Feeding the squirrels by the Grand Canyon Lodges.

Downside: The tour says they pick and drop you off at your hotel. This is FALSE! They group your drop offs and select one of the hotels. In our case, New York, New York...and by some freak of nature it was pouring rain. We had to walk back to our hotel. In this case, I would say the tour company needs to drop their guests off at their hotel. Hey...it'll get you a good tip and a great recommendation.This tour (GC West Rim) had some good parts and some really crappy ones and I'll do my best to tell you about it all.  BTW, I'm 35, female, and outdoorsy. 

We drove to meet the bus at Planet Hollywood at 6:15. We were told "Be here at 6:15, 6:30 at the latest." We sat, waiting, on a RUNNING bus until 7:30! At 6:30 am, an hour and fifteen minutes of waiting seems like eternity. Apparently we were waiting for one other couple who never arrived.

Bus driver was fine -- not terribly entertaining or funny, but he delivered his script of historical information and drove safely.  The speaker in the bus was very loud and I wished I had ear plugs so he wasn't yelling in my ear. The air conditioning vents were also broken, so be sure to bring a jacket as you'll probably have cold air blowing directly on you. 

The drive is fine -- super bumpy dirt road for about 20 minutes, but not curvy or sickness inducing at all! We brought pillows and were glad we did. 

After you arrive at the reservation, your driver gives you your tickets for the park and wishes you well. You'll meet up with him and your bus about 4 hours later to leave. The park requires you to ride their shuttle buses from stop to stop. Jump on the first bus and head to the Skywalk area. We didn't spring for the skywalk cause we'd read reviews that it's waaay overrated. You can walk around there and learn a bit about Native American dwellings as well as enjoy the views of the canyon. Jump on the shuttle again and head to Guano Point where there is a 10 minute (if that!) walk out to a viewing point. Do not let anyone tell you this is a hike -- it's flat and nearly paved. Other than this walk, there aren't any other recreational opportunities at Grand Canyon West. No hiking into the canyon here!

Jump back on the shuttle and they take you back to where you started. There's an additional stop outside of the park area where you go to meet the tour bus for your return trip. This last area is a Wild West themed part that's pretty crappy. It's totally out of place and super lame. That said, I did learn to rope a metal steer and was proud of my accomplishment!

As for food, your ticket price includes a breakfast "snack" which is your choice of a package of pop tarts, donuts, granola bar, etc. Bring other food/snacks for the bus ride -- you'll be glad you did!  You also get a lunch coupon which you can use at one of two places at the park -- the food is mediocre at best, but hey, it's "free" right? We were glad we had snacks with us to supplement our meals. There is a snack bar at the park too but I'd guess it was pretty pricey. 

The trip to the park took about 3 hours. The trip home took 4.5!!! First, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes for a family on our bus that failed to meet at the appropriate time for the return trip. I get that people can be running late, but our driver didn't even acknowledge it or say something like, "Sorry folks. I'll do my best to make up some time on the way home." We stopped at the Hoover Dam on the way back too, and got out for 15 minutes to stretch our legs. This was unnecessary as we were in the parking lot and couldn't walk down to the actual dam. There were also no restrooms here, so you had to go on the bus. We were an hour past schedule at this point and I wish he'd just cut this part out entirely. 

Here's the part they don't tell you about: In the morning, they send around several shuttle buses to gather everyone at their hotels and bring them to Planet Hollywood. In the afternoon, they drive the one big bus to each of the drop off points, so depending on where your hotel is, you may be on the bus an additional hour for each of these stops! We were supposed to return around 5, but didn't get off the bus until 6:45pm. Luckily we didn't have tickets to a show or anything, but I would have been super pissed if we had. This dropping off process is exhausting, given that you've already been on the bus for 3 1/2 hours.

If you're still reading, here are the pros:
- You don't have to drive, so you can sleep, play games on your phone, etc.
- No need for directions or navigating
- Great views of the GC only 3 hours from Vegas.  We went solely to take my parents who had never been and they thought it was great. As my husband and I have been to the North Rim for camping/hiking, it was just "ehhh" for us.

Cons:
- Bus was kinda crappy and uncomfortable
- Bus driver wasn't anything special
- Didn't show movies or any sort of entertainment along the way
- Food was marginal
- Trip home seemed to last an eternity 

All in all, I supposed I'd recommend this trip, as long as you know what you're getting in to.  I probably still would have gone had I known all of this before, because I'd already driven from LA to Vegas and was tired of being behind the wheel. As I said, we brought snacks, drinks, jackets and pillows and were so glad we did! You can leave stuff on the bus so don't worry about bringing too much! Comfort is key!We chose the West Rim bus tour because it is shorter and stops at the Hoover Dam. I also was interested in the Native American heritage of the area, but we unfortunately did not see many Hualapai. We got a good deal at $105 per person (including fuel surcharge). 

Make sure to clarify the shuttle pick-up location with your hotel, they probably have a spot where shuttles pick up for tours. We missed our's because we were in the wrong place but were able to take a taxi and meet the group at the check-in location. If you miss the shuttle, call the number immediately. 

The snack was just what they said, so eat something beforehand or bring snacks too. Our bus driver was enthusiastic and friendly. He talked pretty much the entire time, so don't worry about bringing something to do on the bus.

The Hualapai market at Guano Point was cool, I recommend getting a necklace or bracelet there as a souvenir, rather than something from a store. I got a dream catcher, the seller was able to tell me about the symbolism of its pieces.

The ranch was neat but would have been more fun if the tourists were more enthusiastic about the activities. The few kids on our tour seemed to love it though. Oh, and the cow, Norm, from the movie "City Slickers" lives there.

I thought the lunch was delicious: Ribs or Chicken, 2 sides, cornbread, & a cookie. I recommend the BBQ ribs! And there was an acoustic guitarist and an excellent magician in the hall where you eat to entertain you.

Overall, I'm glad we chose this tour. I would not have wanted to spend more of my vacation on a bus.I enjoyed this trip because it's Grand Canyon! Besides the Canyon everything was mediocre. The snacks for breakfast was not pleasing. I don't like the bus specifically the tv that kept going off and on. The bus bathroom was a sauna. The price was good for what the whole trip provided. Lunch was also included but the pasta was overcooked & salty. Overall, I had a good time with my family and the tour guide was knowledgeable.Ok, for those of you adventurous enough to travel away from the touristy parts of Las Vegas... here is a place where the locals go.   

Where else can you find $5 pai gow poker and black jack?   It's small, it's older but you can gamble for a long time on the cheap here.   They have improved the air handling system, but when you leave you will still smell like smoke.   

Go there and have some good cheap fun.We live in the NW so we spend a lot of time here for movies and bowling. Those are both fine. We love the movie theater because it is never crowded. Bowling can get crowded but you just have to know when to go. Around 2pm on a weekday is usually a good bet. We did stay in the hotel once--back in 2008 and it was not a good experience. The room was dark and dingy and just very uncomfortable. The bathroom was dirty. There were greasy handprints up high on the mirror??? Don't really want to think too much on what that was about. We don't gamble so the casino itself doesn't mean much to us but it isn't usually very crowded. I will say that most of those who frequent Santa Fe Casino seem to be of the 60 and up club. Since we live in Vegas, we're no strangers to casinos and Santa Fe HAS to be the smokiest casino in town. It is really thick in there. It is so bad that we no longer eat at Johnny Rockets, located inside. It is open to the casino but we can't enjoy a meal there because the food is overpowered by the cigarette smoke coming from the casino floor. The Feast Buffet is hit or miss. Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is terrible. It isn't consistent. It is a hang out for our family since it is right near us but if you're coming from out of town and can afford better digs, then I'd suggest staying in them.Large, inexpensive portions of tasty Mexican food? Sign me up!

Unfortunately I don't have that much to say about this place because it is what it is; solid Mexican food that really hits the spot once in a while. My only issue was their dessert. The fried ice cream was amazing except for the fact that it was covered in clearly frozen strawberries which ruined everything. Oh well, still solid!This has got to be the tiniest Tuesday Morning ever! We were cruising Sun City (seriously - looking for our future digs!) and decided to see what they had. Well I can tell you not much. 

I like the one out in the northwest so much better as it's twice the size of this store. 

I give it 3* because the merchandise they carry is nice, but it's too small and cramped for my shopping pleasure.I mainly came here for their photo service. They are a little slow to register what you are asking of them but once they come around, they have what you are looking for.the drinks here are soooo good. as for the food.....ehHOLY TOLEDO batman!

I just went through the drive thru and they got my order RIGHT and it tasted GOOD!

This is a first for this location!

I only got a rodeo cheeseburger so maybe it was because I didn't make it too hard on them ?!?! ;)I love the baked ziti. The breadsticks cannot be beat. When I get my craving for simple pasta, this is my go to place. However, I have ordered meatballs to go as a side...And have never received them.I called and ask specifically if they had the correct pillows/equipment to do a prenatal massage.  They said yes.  They do not.  I had to lay on my side with a pillow between my legs and a small pillow under my head.  It was an ok position, but not the best since they have to work one side and then the other.

The therapist did a good job massaging otherwise I would've given one or two stars.

The facility is in an office building, nothing fantastic, but you get what you pay for and the pricing is pretty good for what they offer.  Don't go here expecting a spa feeling!  The head pillow they had me use looked old and they had an old knitted bright orange and brown blanket over the sheet they covered me with.  There were so many bottles of generic body lotion in the room it made me wonder how old some of them were and which ones they used on me.Eeeeeeh. More like 2.5 stars. We came in late one night and it seemed like we got rushed out the door by the staff and the sub par Chinese food. The duck was super greasy not crispy. The pork chops were soooooooo salty that I felt my blood pressure rise as I was eating it, way too much MSG. The seafood soup was too bland. I shall give this place another chance by coming here at a decent time.The food was decent. I went there with my parents. The service was a little slow, but the staff was nice. My parents go there often enough and the staff recognizes them.  

I had the squid in black bean sauce and the baby bok choy. Hubs and daughter had their usual choice of honey walnut shrimp. My parents ordered the whole steamed fish. 

It was all decent, but nothing was outstanding.  My parents go there frequently, but I haven't been back yet.We had a big meal...Thai eggrolls, level 3 chicken curry and pad see ew, level 0 orange chicken, chicken pad Thai levels 7 and 10.  Eggrolls were good but tiny, curry was spicy, pad see ew was delish, orange chicken was nearly rock hard, and pad Thai was good.  Level 10 was too much and my hubby will dial back next time.  A lucky Yelp find near our home.This spot does lunch specials Monday to Friday until 3pm so the BF and I dropped in to try a new spot. 

There was a sign on the door for To Go Only $2 soup special.  Odd promo as I never see myself needing or thinking of getting soup to go, but I guess if you have a sick friend who suckered you into feel better supply errands get them some soup special or grab one for your favorite homeless on the corner.  

I got the Thai eggplant with pork - the flavor of the sauce was rather good and the vegetable components were all fresh (eggplant, carrots, bellpeppers). It wasn't very spicy though, you would think it was no spice that a 5 level.

BF got the massuman with beef - the meat was tender and I thought the flavor of their massuman was rather good, just the right amount of sweet which I feel tends to be what goes overboard in some places massuman base. 

Portion was fine for a lunch, came with a scoop of rice and 1 veggie eggroll. I see some people's pictures come with soup but we didn't get any. 

The one weird thing is there isn't a restroom? I wonder if you can go to the one that is in through the kitchen, but because of this each table has hand sanitizer. 

Service was just alright. We were given pitcher of water so we didn't really have someone attending to us much aside from ordering and the bill. 

The food we got was decent enough that I would try this place again, but it isn't the first on my list when I'm thinking of grabbing some Thai for lunch.They would've gotten 5-stars, but because they gave me the regular pizza crust when I asked for the gluten free crust, and I didn't notice until I already consumed a bite, that's a big red flag for me.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.  I'm hoping the staff learned to be more attentive to dietary restrictions.

NOTE TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS:  Make sure you DOUBLE CHECK your order once you receive it and ask to speak with a manager.  This is true anywhere you go.This is one messy store, but wow: they have some cheap clothes and accessories! On my recent adventure, I found a high-low dress for $10 and a shirt for $5. But I think that my best deal from here had to be my 7 dollar sunglasses! They're hot! :) Besides summer is coming up and ya gotta protect your eyes! Though, when buying clothes, my suggestion is know your size and body really well because those fitting room lines tend to get kinda long! 

Of course, the quality of clothes is not that great, but hey, its cheap right?! But I have to say that the one good thing about this store is that it has a ton of selections. It almost makes you dizzy how overflowing with stuff this store is! 

Also, be weary of when they feel your clothes with metal sensors. They tend to forget taking them out! Happy shopping!!I was taken here by a friend who lives in Vegas. This is her and her fiance's favorite sushi spots. I was a bit skeptical, I must admit as it is located in an unassuming strip mall. Not really pretty. But, aren't these types of places known to be a gem?

Indeed it was. For $25, you can't go wrong. They have an all-you-can eat menu to which you order and they make it for you right then and there. Absolutely fresh! What I liked about the all you can eat menu was that they had items on there that I normally don't see on an all you can eat menu. Items such as grilled octopus and oysters. The all you can eat menu is not only limited to the sushi and the rolls but they have an all you can eat appetizer section, which I found was awesome!

You also get a ice cream for dessert. But, we weren't sure if it's all you can eat, too. You would think, right?The hodge podge review I guess since there's so many parts to a hotel/casino.

The rooms were a three, maybe even a two.  The beds aren't great and they're fulls instead of queens so it's not a great place to sleep 4 guys (we ended up grabbing a second room somewhere else).  In addition, there's a helicopter airport nearby.

The poker room was pretty small, only one table going, and the tournament starts at 10 a.m.  so I never made it.

The table games were also about a 3.  Some of the dealers are inexperienced.  I never played at the hooters girls as dealers tables either so  that wasn't the reason.

The bar people were pretty friendly though, and gave comp drinks while you played video poker without making you do max bets like some of the other casinos.  Oh, also they actually do comp red bull and vodka while some other places charged for the red bull.

It's also a poor choice for eye candy as a guy, since groups of girls aren't going to decide to stay there, and do you really need to go to Vegas to see Hooters girls?

Basically the redeeming factor is the price/location.The damn resturant is a very good place to eat cheap . The hooter girls are better than the ones we have here.  This place is'nt the first place i would go to gamble that is mgm.  However susan said their where readnecks and was waiting for the tractor pull lol.  Thats funny I live on a farm and still fit in at Pure and tryst with the high end people . Its vegas part of it is that you get to enjoy all types of people. Your proably just mad because those rednecks would'nt give you the time of day.  Hooters looks for rednecks and sports fans, not ho's who spend more money on makeup than blackjack.For being THE Hooters restaurant in the Casino, this place did not stack up to normal Hooters' restaurants across America. The service was decent, but the food just did not taste as good as normal. We stayed there for a few nights (we are locals, this was cheap and while our house did not have water for laundry repair) and ended up eating there twice. I usually LOVE the buffalo chicken sandwich, and both times it was very dry, and pretty much sauce-less and taste-less. Normally, I love this sandwich and its smothered. My boyfriend got salads both times which were much better. I'd say this is the worst Hooters we have ever been to.Stayed here again for 2 nights, paid $30 for a Thursday night and got the second night free via Expedia.
Best deal in town, for that price anyway.
The rooms are clean and comfy and not small at all. Casino is very small but what the hell do you care when you can be @ MGM in 5 minutes - and that is walking from casino door to casino door.
I would stay there here in a heartbeat if I found an amazing deal like that again.Decided to check out the Hooters Restaurant to have a few beers and wings and watch some college football.  Located inside the Hooters hotel, it's located in the very back of the first floor of the casino.

The restaurant has that familiar wood paneling look with plenty of TVs all around to check out the game.  We got here around 3ish so we had no problems getting seats.  We got our menu and it's your typical bar and grill items here, so we're talking about burgers, sandwiches, strip steaks, chicken, and of course their most popular food item, Wings.

We decided to get a couple rounds of beer and also some wings and their chili cheese fries.  The service was a bit slow, but when we got our food I have to say they were generous.  The wings were pretty big and we got a big pile of chili cheese fries.

I don't know how they cook their wings, but have to say I always thought Hooters had some of the best wings out there and this has lived up to it's reputation.  Nice juicy wings with a crispy out side.  The fries here were also very good.  Plenty of chili with nice chunks of meat with a ton of cheese just made for good greasy junk food to watch college football.

The eye candy here wasn't quite what we were hoping for.  When you think of Vegas and Hooters, you have a certain image in your mind.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations we were hoping for.  But no matter, the food and the college football games were still good.

As to ratings, to be honest, the Las Vegas Hooters is really no different than any other Hooters I've been too.  I wasn't expecting the Sapphire or something, but was hoping for just a little bit more "Las Vegas" to it.  Overall, the food hit the spot and the wings were good but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to coming here when you will get the same experience at any other Hooters restaurant across the country.  Overall, just average and a 3 star rating.Not only is this a great price for being so close but just far enough from the strip, the pool is TWENTY FOUR hours***. Now, I'll get back to that later-But first off- the rooms are cleanly and spacious and the staff is hit or miss. Jamie was a GREAT server poolside, she was on top of everything during the whole week and went above and beyond for many reasons.

The casino itself gave 100$ voucher to play slots, but- it was only for about 6 slot machines that were gated off and I didn't witness anyone winning during the 5 minutes it took for me to blow my free money. The tables had low minimums and seemed pretty full the whole trip. I didn't get to take advantage of my free poolside drink and wings voucher or my show tickets- but they were also good perks!

*** So the pools are twenty four hours, which is included in the resort fee- but the large hot tub was not in service the entire week I was there. The overnight security staff increasingly got worse. I don't believe walking up to personal items and opening bags is part of their job. We also didn't have a problem bringing our own canned beverages late night for the first few days, but later on in the week it became an issue.This place was decent, not anything special. They do have good prices though, and the hot sauce they have is fantastic. That's about it, oh yeah and the women were not fine at all.Hooters is surprisingly nice. The rooms were completely decent and although the hotel is a tiny bit off the strip, it's a great place to stay if you're on a budget but still want a nice room. The gambling is cheap, I think it was 5 dollar buy ins, and 25 cent chicken wings for a post drunken chow fest. 

This hotel is perfect for the summer when you can gamble cheap all day here and then walk over to the mgm lazy river. 3 hoots for hooter!Over the years my friends (mostly the male ones) would request to go to Hooters to eat. I would always so no because well this didn't seem like my type of joint (i.e. the uniforms that the girls are required to wear).  

Anyway, so when my roommate told me that we were staying at the Hooters Hotel, well, I really had no choice but to eat here. What are my thoughts now of this establishment? 

The Food: Eh, it's okay. I did try the Hot Wings and I really don't understand people's obsession with them.  The greasiness really just overtakes the chicken flavor. I really disliked that they charge $1 for side-sauce. C'mon! Wings + ranch is a must, therefore they must be sold together, not separate. For shame. 

The Service: Was on point! Our waitress Karen got everything out on a timely manner & was really nice to us ladies.  

The Girls (because isn't that why men come here?): Not as bad as I imagined.  After going to the Tilted Kilt, the Hooters uniforms are saintly. I'm not sure whether a man or woman designed the outfits, but I'm guessing a man did because they're definitely a throw back to the 90's.  The girls looked like my 90's barbie dolls, you know, Theresa, Barbie, Staci with the scrunchy socks and high waisted shorts.

Will I come here again? No, the food wasn't that great. If I were a guy, I guess I would. The girls are friendly.Hooters are always very nice.  We often like to observe, play, and experiment with them.  This goes for the hotel too, where I stayed in a recent 'Vegas trip with the girls.  The first time I went to 'Vegas I stayed at a high-end expensive hotel, which was very classy and nice, but this time I decided to take a dip in the deep end--of the strip I mean, because Hooters is at the edge.  

First of all, let me highlight the FREE PARKING!  That is just truly amazing.  All parking spaces were conveniently located near an elevator entrance too.  After a long, hot, too-much-information-gathering drive, a quick exit to our future weekend home was highly appreciated.  

Next, check-in was a breeze!  Quick, easy, and friendly--Hooters knows how to start off the experience.  By that, I mean the woman who probably knows how to start off a good quick, easy, and friendly night.  I'm just kidding kids!  The staff members are appropriately dressed, super helpful, and you would never think you were in a frat hotel, because that's what we thought it would be like.

On the way to our hotel room, which was in the Ocean Breeze corridor (how relaxing), was just a few minutes away past the convenience shop.  

Although Hooters exceeded my expectations, I'm not sure I need to go back.I stayed here last weekend with a few of my buddies. I thought it was the perfect place if you're young, like 21 (like me), and limited on money. Can't go wrong with $3 blackjack, 50 cent roulette, and $1.50 beers.

The room was standard, but since we only spent about 3-4 hours in it altogether the whole weekend, it was okay. I got a bit aggravated when the cocktail waitresses would only come around every 30-40 min at the tables, but they were busy so I thought what the hell.

Also have 25 cent wings after midnight, but you're required to belong in their little owl club or whatever to be able to get the deal.What epic-ly sucks about this hotel/casino is the hardwood floors. I hate casinos with hardwood floors. It also sucks that they are perpetually on the chopping block. What is the point, therefore, for building comps here? The world may never know.

What DOES get me about this place is the gorgeous looking rooms. I LOVE tropical themes which is why I so much loved the old Mirage and absolutely adore Mandalay Bay and the new Tropicana decor. So, Hooters make me feel so happy because of that decor choice. I also like their 24/7 pool. Who does that? A guaranteed late-night fiasco (although it is quiet late at night which I actually love)! All Vegas strip hotels should get on Hooters' level on this matter.I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeatSo, I stopped in to the casino for a low cost Blackjack game and a little lunch.  The Casino was a little dead so I headed over to get some lunch.  I was there about 2 pm in the afternoon.  What can I say, with a place like this the main attraction is the great looking waitstaff and second attraction is the food.  My server was great but she had to cover far too many tables.  I ordered fish tacos.  I had this at another Hooters restaurant and it was outstanding.  This was poorly cooked, and improperly seasoned.  It was a very mushy taco.  Sorry even a great waitress can't bring me back to a place that serves poorly cooked food.  Disappointed in my food, I left the casino entirely.  So my server was a 4 otherwise I would have given them a 1 or 2.We checked in on a Tuesday afternoon. The hotel is located off the strip but in a walking distance from the strip. We were given a room on Bay Side, facing the pool on the 8th floor. The pool/jacuzzi is open 24 hours which is VERY convenient, so bring your bathing suit!! The bathroom could use some TLC and so can the carpeting in the room. Everyone that worked in the casino were very nice, we were constantly greeted. If you get the midnight munchies, "Mad Onion" is the place to go. Don't miss Hooters!! Make sure you stop by, they open at 11 AM, not sure what time they close.you get what you pay for. BF and I came here for a 3 night stay in the middle of the week, and i think each night was 20 bucks? plus resort fees.

it's not too far from the strip, plus we drove there so we could easily get to the strip. 

Free valet, if you must. we just parked on our own and avoiding tipping every time we went to and from the car. 

The rooms are average, they're clean. 

EXCEPT on the 2 morning when they were doing construction right across the hall and next to our room at 7am. are you serious?!!?!!?!? I was furious

I went to complain at the front desk and all they would do is waive 2 nights of resort fees. SERIOUSLY? why did you put us on a floor with construction?! and it went on for hours. the guy next door to us was pissed too.

Definitely minus 1 star. esp because they were so nonchalant about it too. unapologetic. basically, they didnt give a rat's booty. 

Overall, im ok with this hotel. its just that incident that makes me protest a little about returning.... but for the price.. sigh. i guess ill suck it up..... =.=ZzZzZzZStayed here with a large group. Everything was fine, although a renovation would definitely help. Room rates were quite cheap for the weekend and the room had no problems. The location is great if you're looking to explore the rest of the strip. The group I was with had a great time at their pool which was a good size, but not insanely busy like many of the "ultimate pools" on the strip.My 1st time staying at Hooters. It's not as sexual as it may seem to be. It's a regular 'ol casino/hotel w/ nothing more than hard working ladies taking care of their customers. Hotel is SMALL (which is good): everything is accessible without having to run around a maze of slot machines/shops to find a bathroom. It's easy to navigate & clean. It's DATED: meaning it's not fancy/modern. Which is TOTALLY fine with me, especially for the affordability! What I was not a fan of is the elevators: they are in dire need of repairs. We were given a 15th floor room (very nice view of the mountains in the distance & the pool below). 1 of the times in which i was in the elevator going up, it dropped by a few feet. SCARED ME TO DEATH! I avoided that elevator from then on out and told the hotel people about the incident. Hopefully they will fix/update the machinery soon, 'cause the weird noises are a sure sign of worse things to come! Besides this: the hotel is great! Unbeatable location if you are looking to be close to the south end of the strip. The MGM (which is a billion times more expensive per night) is directly across the street. Granted, the MGM has more amenities, but if you are just looking for a clean/comfortable place to sleep while in vegas, without spending all of your budget on the hotel room, stay at Hooters. (PS: the pool seems nice. i didn't get to use it since this was a 48 hour business trip at the beginning of march 2014 but i would have used it if i had had a chance).You know the old saying, you get what you pay for? This definitely applies to the Hooters hotel. The price is so cheap and the hotel has the bare minimum. I went with friends and we all split the room and it was practically free. 

The location isn't that great because it's kind of far from everything but you walk a lot in Vegas anyways. I've been to Vegas so many times and I definitely wouldn't put this place on the top of my list but it was a memorable experience. We had dinner at the restaurant and the food was okay. The service wasn't that great.

If you want to do Vegas cheap then you should stay here. You're never really in your room anyways so who cares.Havent been to a Pho House in a while so this was pleasant. Parking was okay, but tight. Location is pretty far off the strip.

Fresh Spring Roll Appetizer was good, I had the Rice combo. Your choice of BBQ Pork of BBQ Chicken, I took the Chicken and Egg Rolls. Great. Love it. It came with a broth soup.Pickled Carrots and some dipping sauce. The other dish was Pho and Viet Ice Coffee. All together $20. What a deal.The beef stew isn't what everyone else here made it out to be. It was more like a thick starchy soup (as in, some cook threw in corn starch or something like that) and but not extremely flavorful and beef-y tasting (like how a real stew should be). 

I also tried the grilled pork over rice - pretty decent. 

Nothing to really write home about, but nothing to hate on either. It's aite.We didn't have the pho, so take this review with a grain of salt.  We both had the vermicelli noodle bowls, one with grilled chicken and eggrolls, and one with grilled pork and shrimp with eggrolls.  The amount of meat and vegetables in the bowls was a little lacking, and the meat itself was a bit fatty.  The service was really quick and friendly though.  Others looked like they were enjoying the pho, so we'll have to try that next time!I like the pho here a little better than Pho So 1. The tea tasted a little funny. I can make better french rice. So on an average I would say this place is good.I went here once around lunch and it was not bad. I had some BBQ skewers and kare kare and both were cooked right. Definitely hit the spot and was quality.

However, I don't think it's good to grab later on in the day....a few days ago I stopped in starving...since I needed to get groceries at 168 and I'd pass out before I can make it home to make dinner. It was at night maybe around 7-8 and I don't think the food has been changed at all and didnt look fresh so I walked out and went to a sit down Chinese spot instead. Bummer. I have been craving filipino food, but not when it's not fresh. 

So if I'm around early, I'll stop in for turo turo....if its late at night I'll have a go only on their cook to order crispy pata.....mmmm always a wonderful heart clogging treat and made to order palabok.This place is a cute authentic little Argentinian/ Italian restaurant and market that sticks out like a sore thumb in the heart of Chinatown in the Cathay Hills Plaza center. My boyfriend, is half Italian and Argentinian and he was eager to try this place out for dinner.   

When we walked in, the restaurant/market smelled delicious! It didn't help that we were starving and wanted to order everything on the menu. Luckily the server quickly brought out complimentary bread and homemade chimichurri. We both wished the bread was warm or toasted, but it wasn't - it was room temperature. The bread wasn't the best or the freshest, but the chimichurri certainly made up for it. The chimichurri was flavorful and had a nice acidity to it.  

We ended up with 4 different hot baked empanadas $2.25 each: 
Beef - Very rich and meaty flavor, my boyfriend like this one the most. 4/5

Spinach - thick spinach and cheese filling. I enjoyed this one. 4/5

Corn - piping hot insides and tasted similar to creamed corn - just not as sweet. 2/5

Ham & cheese - this one also had a very hot and gooey cheese filling and ham bits. This is one of my favorites. 4/5

Also we shared a rather huge hot sandwich - Lomito Completo $10.99:
Not worth $11 - A very thin hammered down piece of mignon with melted provolone cheese, very salty ham, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, mayo, on a baguette bread. The steak and ham were thin and way over salted. The salt was so strong that it offended my taste buds. The fried egg was overcooked so it didn't have a runny yolk and that's always a shame in my book. The sandwich was a generous size in a huge bread roll. We were only able to tackle a half of it. The fries that accompanied it were nice, hot and crispy, just the way I like my fries. I just couldn't get past the over salting issue - I could feel my mouth shriveling up. 2/5

We also ordered 1 soda. Our total damage was $25 and change. 

In the end, we were uncomfortably full - everything was extremely heavy, oily, and extra salty. I did appreciate their empanadas, but the hot sandwich was a hot salty mess.This is a drinkers bar. It's got plenty of TVs, a juke box, Golden Tee machines, pool tables and some couches to relax on to watch the games. NY Yankee fans will give this place 8 stars. No food here so I gave it 3.A friend of mine who lives in LV took us over here on a Saturday morning after a crazy night of clubbing. The service was pretty decent and the food was good. I ordered the french toast with a side of coffee.. It was very tasty. Yum yum... Everybody else seemed to like their food as well. 

Hmmm... I usually elaborate in my reviews.. but I can't say much about this one.. It's like any typical breakfast diner.. I can't say it's better than IHOP or Denny's.. I think most breakfast diners have very similar food and service.. It just tastes really good when you have a craving for American breakfast items... Ok.. that is all.. Take care now, bye bye...I had the Chicken Crepe, and a cranberry juice.

The cranberry juice tasted like they were running out, and added water to it, very weak tasting.  Already not the best start.

The crepe was actually pretty good.  The chicken mixture in it kinda tasted like what you would get in a chicken pot-pie; but instead of carrots/peas, you get red/green peppers, mushrooms, and olives.  

It came with four potato pancakes.  Now, these are NOT latkes, these are four extremely thin, almost flavorless sheets of potato.  As if someone made hash browns, froze them, and shaved a few layers off of the top.  It needed salt, pepper, anything.

The entire meal was decent, I'd go back.For less than $9 a pop, if I were a homeless guy, I would maybe try and save up enough to eat here for the day. 

Not the best food by any means though.i was a little turned off my last trip by the lurking buspersons, they eyeballed you every little bite and the signs posted everyhwhere that this is not an everyday buffet-you MUST eat what you take or you may have to pay MORE. seemedkinda petty & strange,were they counting my plates & how would they enforce such a thing -try to fet you to pay more after you eat or stop you after 3,4 or 5 plates & say "sir you must now pay per plate" The rangoons were freaking awesome i probably ate like 15-20 of them, the crab legs were hot, juicy and VERY meaty melted in your mouth. The wonton soup was good and sushi was fresh & tasty. Breaking the posted rules I continued to load up plate after plate so I could try everything the mussels the frog legs and everything else. Overall the food was pretty good, the ribs were really tough but the seafood was fresh and the DONUTS were hot and oh so yummy-I  ate like 6-7 of them.

Well there was no wait to get in or be seated and the place was packed, refills were fast coming,plates were cleared fast , for the most part the food was good-i'm a rib guy and it was a little disappointing. The price was right under $30 for 2 people. We will return.Not too bad of a buffet. 

Completely agree with Guy C's comment on the hot and sour soup. it was neither hot nor it was sour. The spicy was from very very finely grounded black pepper and that's about it. 

Service is okay in regards to busing plates and refilling drinks. If you need extra forks or napkins it's faster go just grab them yourself. 

The food is good but after your first time everything's pretty much the same. Most likely will return but not for a few monthsWe went for Father's Day -- about $20/person. Lots of seafood, including grilled prawns, crab legs, and stir fried lobster tails, oysters, scallops, and even frog legs, OK sushi and nigiri, They also have your typical Asian fair -- deep fried, heavily sauced, w/ mayo, or sweet and sour, some kind of soybean, Mongolian stir fry... everything and anything... dessert was typical of an Asian style buffet. Dry cakes, self-serve froyo bar w/ various sugar toppings, and fresh fruit which included a chocolate fountain.    

Servers were attentive, our drinks never ran empty... They accommodated our large party. (10+)It was good, you know, better than okay, just based on the different selections and variety. But ya... the eyes are always bigger than the stomach. So we overate, stuffed our faces, and stood by the "no waste or you pay" rule. 

That's pretty much it. But a fork in it -- it's BEEN overdone.It's a toss up depending on if you ask me or my husband. I liked this buffet better than Little Dumplings (on Craig Rd); my husband is the opposite. But we both agree the food it not great but decent for an asian buffet.

This buffet has a very nice selection of foods. The stations are nicely spaced apart and clean. There was a nice sushi selection; and nice selection of seafood (shrimp, salmon, frog legs, crab), a mongolian grill (you choose what you want and staff cooks it), the usual asian fare and soups, fresh fruit & chocolate for dipping, soft serve as well. 

The building is an older one and the decor is old. But you're not there to eat either so it doesn't really matter to me. This buffet does offer take-out but be warned- they weigh you container to make sure it's not over 2 lbs. No joke, I saw the scale by the register. 

Overall, it was something new but I don't know if we'd go here again unless we were in the area. I think we might try the other location though on Eastern... I've heard good things about that one.I went to @ Asia buffet, for my favorite Xmas tradition Chinese food, and movies, the place was packed but the service was great, quick drinks and plenty of food coming out of the kitchen, one of the best Suchi lay outs i've seen in a buffet here in Vegas.Was a bit more pricier than I thought but they did have seafood.. Crab legs and shrimp as well as lobster claws which was too messy to eat. The food in general was okay.I've been to a few Asian Buffet Restaurants since moving to Vegas. All of them seem to have one theme, that is average plain food served in large quantities.

Its sad but this Buffet is no different with its food selection but I will say the Black Pepper Frog Legs are the best item on their Buffet and they are simply the best damn Frog Legs I've ever had!

For those of you who love their Lobster dish: yes I tried their lobster dish and this Seafood lover wasn't overly impressed. It was messy and since you had to shell the lobster yourself you ended up with their slimy sauce all over your fingers and if you are a little bit clumsy like me it will fall off of your plate and land onto your shorts.  

Also today's lobster tasted very strongly of fish (for those of you land locked Vegas locals your fish and seafood shouldn't smell strongly of stinky fish. If it does it indicates its not fresh and hours away from making you sick) today's lobster dish was stinky to say the least but I did brave a few bites. Thinking of my digestive health I thought it a wise choice to push the last few pieces aside.

The Sushi seemed OK but was mostly rice. I guess it was what you'd expect at a buffet.

Service at the door was a bit cold. We were there a good hour and a half before closing but the server seemed rushed and disinterested in making us feel welcome. In fact she walked us to a back room pointed at a table and only said sit there before walking away. We were the only new customers so she didn't need to rush back. A simple statement of your server will be right with you but feel free to help yourself would have been nice.

The waitress was very attentive and cleared empty plates and filled sodas quickly. Almost made me forget how we were treated at the door.

For $70 (dinner for three and a tip) I guess I was expecting a top notch experience they were unable to deliver. I'd go back to give them a 2nd try but tonight I left sorely disappointed.Decent enough buffet with the typical findings. Not a very large selections, or it doesn't feel like it has a large one. There's some more specialty items here like a larger sushi bar, fresh stirfry, sometimes tritip, and tempura. And there are the typical asian buffet fair.

One star off for bad service--half the time the servers flounder. And the building layout sucks.
Another star off for some of their food is just lacking, or seems a bit "watered down". 

I like to go here when I get tired of other asian buffets in the area. Try coming here as it opens as the food is fresher and sometimes there's dishes that are only laid out once. If you don't want to take the risk, try Krazy Buffet up the road.Mr D's definitely an older crowd!  Damn I may be the you youngster!  Clearly much different from the Vegas strip!  Great looking bartender!The Hubs and I went to Vegas to celebrate my 30th, he wanted to pull out all the stops and indulge in spa treatments at the MGM Grand ($340 for a 90 minute massage) I started looking around online and found Saffron. 

We booked the couples 'delicious duet' and for a little over $400 had an excellent experience. The massages and facials were great (I think...I snored and was totally asleep for mine. This is actually a good thing, I have NEVER been so relaxed) and my husband really enjoyed his.

The pedicures were pretty good, the gentleman that works there made a few questionable comments while exchanging light banter and was a little rough with the callus remover. 

Also the scalp massages listed in the price menu never happened. That would have been nice to receive. 

Over all very clean and professional, good staff and very accommodating and friendly.I drive by this location often going to and from plays at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.  I always see their Blizzard of the Month and I have never had one.  I'm always on my way home and it's on the wrong side of Spring Mountain Road.

OK, I had extra time the other night and I had a strong desire to get some ice cream on the 100 degree day.  Problem solved.  Traffic was lighter than normal and I was able to make the south turn into the DQ , parked, and went inside.

The store is a bit old and somewhat rundown, but it was clean and there weren't many people there.  I looked at the Blizzard board for quite awhile and decided to go with the Blizzard of the Month--Confetti cake.  That's white cake pieces and confetti frosting blended with vanilla soft serve.  It was OK.  I should have stood firm with something peanut butter, but hey, when you're Blizzard of the Month, I guess you have to be good.

I may stop here again but I'll order with more care.  The staff was very pleasant and let me take all the time I wanted to decide.  Good service.Standard Sonic. If you like Sonic, you'll like it here. Fun Fact: we shot a pick-up scene for a porno here in Jan of 2010.I've always loved going to Sonic. Cheap eats and drinks that tastes better that McD's or any other fast food places in town. My bf loves their malt shakes. I love that I receive texts informing me whenever they have daily specials (like .50 burgers or .99 hot dogs). Food comes fast and the carhops are usually friendly.We ended up repeating at this location of Jiffy Lube for oil change after trying out several other places. Nothing notable, but in an industry where a rip-off is the norm, it's a compliment.I have been to Marnee Thai a couple of times. It isn't what I would consider the 'best' Thai food I have ever had, though I am not sure if I have experienced that yet.. though Lotus of Siam is pretty bad ass in my book. 

What i do like about Marnee thai is that they are open late until 2 am. It's not the latest open place in China Town, but it's always a good option when a place is open that late. 

I have never shown up for any special event, only for the curry, pad thai and stuffed wings (of which i have had much better) .. but the little older man that sits at the the karaoke stage and sings Lionel Richie and Commodore's covers .. in Thai... is a nice touch ; ]

he bill is always about $45-$60 for two of us with beers, so it's not over the top pricey .. in fact  i think the Chicken Pad Thai is $8.99. 

Id give it a try if you're looking for late night, low-priced, still pretty quality thai food.I have been coming here for years. Probably at least 20 years. It's right around the corner from my parents' house. It's always clean and the employees are friendly.Food was good, drink prices were alright. I tend to be surprised when barstaurants can't split c.hecksThis is a seriously late ass review. Better late and never, right? haha

I wanted dim sum the last time I was in Vegas and this was the place that I found on Yelp and that a couple friends (that live in LV) were familiar with.

Granted that it's not the best dim sum restaurant out there, it's decent. Some of the dishes were really good but after a while if you keep saying "no" to the ladies and their carts, they will stop coming by (which of course was when I wanted something). So expect typical minimal Asian service but they do come when flagged down.

The next time I'm there and craving dim sum... I'm trying the other places. :PMaybe it was the heat or maybe it was the 5 straight hours drive because the dim sum didn't taste that great, which was strange because there were a lot of customers when we arrived.   

There was not a lot of variety. We had to say no to a few carts coming by because it was the same food or the carts had nothing interesting on them. Food was okay, but some items were not hot enough. It was just warm and that made the mediocre food even worse.

Service was okay. We had to keep asking where the carts were, but they did refilled our teapot when it was empty. 

Overall, okay place if you're desperate for some dim sum, but I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.Cathay is A-Ok. Good food, good prices and good for groups. Its not a fancy place to eat but the food is always good. They give you tea which is so refreshing to start your meal.

 Depending on how busy they are really seems to correlate with the service you get. We have been there with great service and then other times I think they forgot we were even there.

It can get really busy there so make sure to go early. The weekends are the busiest but if you go before 11 you should be able to get seated pretty quick.

All in all- a solid place for decent, well priced dim sum!I wish you could do half stars because it isn't a 3 it's a 3 1/2.  Unfortunately, they are the best dim sum in town.  Ping Pang Pong is way over rated.  Seafood harbor is not really a dim sum place.  And that all day dim sum place is just too dirty and it isn't quite as good either.  If you want dim sum, Cathay House is it.Good place to go for Dimsum.
Lots of seating, so space is not an issue. 
Food is always hot, and price is cheap. 
Lots of selection!The food here is good. I can't complain. But I feel it is a bit overpriced. Not my number one choice of Chinese restaurants, but I'll have dim sum or a late night meal if people want to go. If you want good chinese food that is on the higher end of the price range, this is the place for you.While I think the cabeza here is on point, this visit some of the meats were a bit fatty and gristly compared to my last review. It was more noticeable in my MILs pastor torta and she's more of a "taster" taking small bites so she had to pick at hers. 

I still thought the flavor was good on their meats, but just a noticeable difference in quality with the pastor mostly. The lengua, cabeza ones I ordered were fine. Everything came out piping hot and fresh though. I noticed a few reviews that's touted this fatty gristle from the past so perhaps it's inconsistent with trimming.  This is just my second time so not exactly sure if there are more good days than bad. Pick out the bites you don't like? 

I noticed a ton of people on this day were ordering various soups. Caldo de res seemed the most popular so I might come back for that. I saw on the menu menudo, caldo camerones and birria as well. I went on a weekend and most places serve that stuff on a weekend only so I am not sure if this is a all week item as I didnt really pay the most attention to the wall menu closely.

It may be tacos el Compita but it seems that the Hispanic community seems to go caldo route. I'll come back and follow what everyone else is ordering next time.Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast.First let it be know I do not like BBQ sauce.......that being said I really like the  ribs that have the rub not the sauce. My husband like the chicken and mashed potatoes. All the sides are just okay. Also I wish I could just order ribs solo. Only chicken comes solo or as a combo. Yet I still crave this place......so give me just ribs as an option please, then you'd be a 4 Fo Sho!I love McDonald's... Duh but I'm eating my mcchicken and the bun is hard which usually happens after 9pm anyways! Oh well I also ordered Big Mac and 20 pc. Chicken nugget... When we got to the window I asked for various sauces including an "Asian sauce" but the guy at the window took total offense and copped an attitude with me. He asked if I meant sweet chili sauce?? I felt like I may have upset him for some reason (but we are all ppl and I wouldn't have been insulted if he asked me for white sauce!! LoL) so I said sorry and that I meant the Kung pao sauce. But he said that didn't exist and was a dick! I'm glad I didn't ask for gay sauce. Ha! Dude come on. Ppl r ppl. It is what it is!!I liked this walmart, it was big, well lit, the parking lot was well organizaed.

The lines where a nightmare, but hey it's walmart, sit back and enjoy the people watching!It was ok to me - the bagel was a little tough & didn't really care for their coffee.I'm not sure how to review this place.  It's fast food Italian but it's not a pizzeria, weird.  When here I get the chicken Parma meal: I eat the chicken to completion as it is very tasty and crisp if you dine in, leave over the spaghetti as it has no flavor and can't eat the rolls as they are always hard as a rock.My goal was simply to grab a quick, somewhat healthy carb meal the night before a very long run. I wasn't after gourmet Italian - just wanted simple. I was pleasantly surprised at the affordable prices and healthy options here! I ordered a 400 calorie whole wheat penne pasta dish that was fine for my  needs. And quite affordable at a hair under $4 ! My dining partner opted for the fully loaded whole wheat penne pasta (NOT off the healthy menu) for only $4.50 and added chicken for a mere $1.29 more. He liked it. When you dine in they give you unlimited breadsticks, too. (Tempting, but I was strong and just had a bite.) We'll be back. They also do convenient carryout.  Great service, too.I would love to live here but rental process is shady. Got quoted first at 689 a month. Then a few days later for 747. Then 774 a few days later. And then 797 about a month later. I understand that rates change all the time but since they got my contact information they just kept on increasing the rent every time I asked them for a quote.A decent steakhouse, great atmosphere and is what I expect from a great steakhouse.... the only thing I got the bone in rib eye (I asked for med rare and it was more like a strong medium, cool center makes sense right?). They made it up to me in a glass of wine that had ordered and the waitress was nice. 

As Bubba N mentioned a plus is they have a good selection of bread that's brought to your table, but that's no reason for 5 stars... but I would tell everyone that this is a 3.5 stars because their appetizers are AMAZING, get their Wagu Carpaccio and their Jumbo Shrimp Combo.... that was waaaaaay better than my dinner. 

 So if you're looking for a light dinner, get the appetizers and a glass of wine, it's not worth to pay the $40+ for a steak.The Range Steakhouse at Harrah's seems to be a hit or miss with some people.  For me, it was in between, but leaning towards a hit.  It was my last night in Vegas and I was craving a really good Ribeye steak.  I could've gone to other upscale steakhouses on the Strip like CUT, Craftsteak, or Delmonico's, but I wasn't in the mood to spend a whole lot of money and The Range was the more affordable option.  I managed to make a 9pm reservation here from Tix4Tonight and scored a voucher for 50% off my main entree, which made it even more afforable!

The place is pretty classy.  Nice panoramic view of Strip, dark mood lighting, and not very noisy.  However, right off the bat, my wine glass had a nice dirty ring around the rim.  Gross.  Definitely had that changed right away.

I ordered the 20oz Bone In Ribeye and a side of Creamed Spinach.  Why I ordered the Creamed Spinach, I had no idea because that 20oz Ribeye was a huge!!  Take a look for yourself (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=D282Ui_HVGY2GpjI2dwD_g).  What was disappointing though was that the Ribeye wasn't seasoned very well and didn't have any flavor.  I also ordered it medium rare, but it seemed very unbalanced to me with some sections cooked medium and some parts were downright rare, especially towards the bone.  My waiter didn't really give me much attention even though I was right in front of him.  I don' t recall him ever checking on me until the end of my meal so I didn't really have a chance to ask him to take my Ribeye back and cook it again.

Oh well, I was hoping for a better experience, but I guess you can't have everything when you're getting 50% off.  3.5 stars for being one of the more affordable steakhouses on the Strip.Mama Maria's Mexican restaurant was a fun place for me to try because it's decently close to where I live. My family and I ordered for takeout, which was very convenient. One thing to note is that we participate in the season of Lent, so we had to avoid beef and poultry. Seafood and eggs are fine for us to have eaten.

I commend this restaurant on really good service. They had a busy restaurant, but were able to have our takeout order ready on time and neatly packed, which was much appreciated.

We ordered guacamole, Chilles Relleno, garlic butter shrimp, shrimp fajitas, and crispy shrimp tacos.

Our order came with chips and salsa! Like everybody has pointed out, the chips come in the form of freshly fried tortillas that you break into tinier pieces. The salsa was delicious! The tomato sauce in it interestingly had a "pasta sauce" flavor, which for me, set it apart from any other Mexican salsa I've ever tried. They sent us home with a bunch too, so I was very happy!

We also ate the chips with the guacamole we ordered. It was good and fresh guac, but it seemed plain for my taste.

We didn't care for the shrimp fajitas or the butter garlic shrimp too much, not very special. The crispy shrimp tacos were a big bust in my opinion because I expected deep fried, breaded shrimp and I thought that was what the menu meant when they said "crispy", but apparently that description was only referring to the taco shell, which I cancelled out when I asked to have my tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla instead. Furthermore, nothing had sour cream or crema, which was odd to me. I guess I just didn't realize I had to order it separately.

The Chilles Relleno was SUPERB. My dad and I were so impressed by how tasty this dish came out! If you ever visit this restaurant, that is certainly the dish to try. It was spongy from the egg, but also satisfyingly saucy at the same time. There was a lot of good flavor to it, too. The portion size was another thing I was happy with also.

Overall, I wouldn't look forward to ordering anything but the Chilles Relleno. That's the thing to try, hands down.The Drive Thru sucks. I mean the food comes out quickly. And Whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast. A plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks. But literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on Rainbow blvd and its hard to get out. And if you come in the wrong way, you have to flip a u turn to get into the drive thru. To late for them to redo it now. I guess when im on that side of town, ill venture inside from now on.This is a prime location for residents of Mountains Edge sitting on such a busy corner.  The fries here are always tasteless and soggy, they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration.  If I feel like grabbing a #2 value meal I much rather travel to the McDonalds 4 miles North on Rainbow.The food is good - both breakfast and lunch, however every time we have eaten there, it is a little slow.  One time we were there for 30 minutes after we finished eating - waiting for the bill.  Seems to happen quite often.Well.. Went here for dinner and drinks on Saturday night around 6. Nice atmosphere not too loud. I ordered a vodka tonic to start the evening and our waitress brought that right up my girlfriend however ordered a French martini and that took a bit. Upon bringing her her drink she said sorry if it doesn't taste good that's the first time he's ever made one. Seriously? Bartender never made a French martini? It was ok but didn't taste like any French martini she's ever had. The food was good tasted fresh. The chicken parmesan and the fettuccine Alfredo were safe bets so we ordered that. Not too long of a wait and nice portions. Wouldn't mind going back but probably not a first choice :/I will give this place 3 stars for their bread as well as their lunch service, it was friendly and attentive.

My mother and I ate here, she said she liked it. She had a pasta dish, and I had the unlimited soup and salad, zuppa and Caesar salad.

The soup was good, but extremely meaty, with bacon. I don't prefer bacon so  I ate the broth. It was still tasty and if you like soup, but the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden is much better (sorry, sad truth).

If you get salad, ask for the dressing on the side, which is what I usually do, or it will be drowning. Also, definitely try the bread, it's warm and quite delicious.

Finally, we shared the salted caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake was probably a B. I'd eat it again.

I wouldn't eat here for dinner and I wouldn't choose to eat here again, it seems pricey for what I had, but I would eat lunch here again with my mom if she wanted to eat here.Not a bad little golf course location on the west side of Madison (Middleton).  The price is better than other Madison area courses, so if you want to hit a round but not go too far, this is affordable.  

It's an easy course to walk, especially the back 9.  The front has a tough climb from hole #7 to #8, but other than that, there's no reason to have a gas cart (unless you prefer it).

Call ahead to make sure there aren't any special outings.  I've showed up on a weekday morning to hit a quick nine and have been turned away for an outing I wasn't aware of.

I use the course for my "rebound" rounds.  If I'm not hitting well, Tumbledown is good for my ego.  Most holes you can play your slice from another fairway.  If you're hitting well, you'll be very pleased with your scores.

In summary, while it's not the greatest course, it's an easy and affordable round.  

If you want highbrow golf with a strict dress code and PGA rules, go somewhere else.  Tumbledown is a nice place for a relaxing round or a group outing.Grade: C

Neighborhood bar. Unimaginative food. Good prices. Decent service.Well above average service..Great TVs! Beer prices abit high..In summary,comfortable and fun.Madison's boating and yachting community know this as a traditional old spot on the north shore of Lake Mendota east of Waunakee.  Good fish fry and interesting decor.Stopped in late on a Saturday night. Traditional supper club with a European theme to it. We wanted to stay in Waunakee for dinner (as opposed to going in to Madison). It met our needs but, was just average. Hostess/servers were friendly and efficient but, not overly so.

I felt the A-OK rating fit best. Considered a fourth star though.Avoid the buffet. Stuff sitting out a long time lacks the freshness and has been poked at by too many people.
This is just a generic american style chinese/cantonese type semi-fast food restaurant. Ordering off the menu provides serviceable but uninspired food. You probably won't find too many Chinese people eating there.Grade: C-

Ummm. Hmmm. Okay. Uhhhh. Huh. Right. What should I say? Yeah.One thing you have to like about Starbucks is that you get a consistent drink every time. Sometimes though its about how long one needs to wait for this consistence. It's location has been remodeled recently and looks amazing. 

That is all ...Good juicy sandwiches, but the bread is a bit too soft (I like mine more dense). They have a good deli and beer selection, and a fairly good amount of junk food goodies as well. My best description of the place is that it's a slightly higher class 7-11, but without the slurpees and the hot dogs, which is pretty disappointing. The cashiers and deli people there are quite nice though.I wish I could give this place a 4! But the flavor just wasn't there, nor the portions for the price. This restaurant is on State St. and definitely has a hide-away on State St. feel. 

I did appreciate that there were about 5 vegetarian options. They also have sampler dinner platters for $25/person. I ordered the paneer dish (I can't recall if it was Chana or Masala paneer). I did like that all entrees came with choice of soup or salad. We ordered one of each. The lentil soup was very good, nice spices and depth. The salad was nice, a normal side salad. Fresh ingredients. 

I was disappointed in my entree. It was $12, came with a scoop of rice (maybe 2/3 c, which is fine for my waist line) and the dish itself was mostly paneer. It desperately needed two things: vegetables, and more spices! The paneer was delicious and hot, but it was a LOT of paneer (probably 8-10 ounces, which would be about 1000 calories from the cheese alone) and no veggies. There was a bit of tomato (perhaps 1 tablespoon...). The sauce was very minimal (just barely coating the cheese). 

Dinner companion (boyfriend) had some lamb dish and said it was okay but also seriously lacked flavor, and we agreed on 3 stars. 

We also had lassis, one mango and one strawberry. They did taste homemade. They were much thinner than a regular lassi, so I decided to believe this meant fewer calories. 

The bill came to $40. It felt like too much for what we got and the serious lack of flavor and spice.I haven't been to Jolly Bob's in awhile due to the fact that the service and quality of the food seemed to have drastically declined since first experiencing this restaurant in 2000.  There is better jerk in town, but all the fish dishes at JB's are excellent and not really available at other Caribbean places.  The one thing that definitely sets this place apart, though, is the drinks! If you like them like I like my men (fruity, but strong and with an umbrella) then you'll love Jolly Bob's. I recommend the Purple Meanie or the Painkiller. Mmm...wish I had one now.This is a very cheerful restaurant--bright blue and yellow walls, a saltwater fish tank with all sorts of neat coral, and delicious tropical cocktails.  Try the lemongrass margarita.  A good place to go when it's rainy or you're feeling down.

There's only one vegetarian entree on the menu (the vegetable curry), but it is quite tasty and the portion is substantial.  The entrees come with their house salad, which is fresh, delicious, and topped with your choice of mango curry, jerk strawberry, passion fruit, or banana poppyseed dressing.  Yum!  

For appetizers, the fried plaintains, guacamole, and grilled pineapple salsa are all good.  I was less impressed with the watercress and heart of palm salad.  The salad itself was good, but the dressing was nearly intolerably tart.

I docked Jolly Bob's a star because it is cramped, crowded, and can get terribly busy and noisy.  The services is not the greatest.  It can be extremely hard to get the bartender's attention; you practically have to stick a twenty in his face.  Frankly, I don't think their staffing is up to the demand.  There should have been two or three bartenders, but there was only one, and he was helping with tables as well.  The waitstaff should have been doubled and the host should have been sitting at the front of the restaurant, NOT in some corner behind the fish tank. 

I recently went during the last week of their Groupon.  We got to the restaurant at 5:45p, weren't seated until 6:30, and had to wait another half hour for our salads.  The drinks came AFTER the salads, and the entrees after that.  We didn't get out of the restaurant until 8:00.  This was on a Monday night!  It's never been quite that bad before, but definitely a place to go early.

Note: They don't take credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant, but it has a $2 fee.  Bring cash.  The drink prices are fairly standard, but the entrees are a bit expensive.I was incredibly skeptical of eating here based on the appearance of the building. I do however trust in the "hole in the wall" experience so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how big  the inside was compared to what I expected. The "hostess" stand is halfway through the building on the other side of the bar- not really welcoming. 
We were sat immediately which was nice since it was 8 pm on a Friday night and this was our second stop since the first was packed. 
We were given water right away and were able to browse the menu and decide on food before the server came back for our drink orders. We didn't order any drinks but the ones around us looked good, fairly reasonable $6-$8. 
Salads came out really fast (I believe all the wedge salads were pre-made and they just add your ordered dressing) the Jerk strawberry vinaigrette was delicious! 
And then we waited... Fresh warm bread was delivered and it was really good! But then we waited... And finally our entrees came out (the avo cat- deliciously prepared fish, and coconut shrimp appetizer- a little oily but a really good flavor) by the time the server returned to check on us we were done. It took a few more passes before he brought us the check and we found out plastic wasn't accepted. Not unusual for a Willy St business but annoying because we didn't want to wait for the change. 
The ambience wasn't anything to write home about- even the salt water tank only had one small tiny fish! The food was good, a little overpriced but slow service... Might try it one more time, especially for the drinks!I actually meant to head to Fair Trade Coffee, but I think I had my map of State Street reversed in my mind, because instead of heading towards campus, I was actually heading towards the Capitol. Long story short, Michelangelo's was the last coffee shop on State before I hit the Capitol, so I decided to pop in and grab a coffee and quick breakfast before starting my day.

I ordered a dirty chai latte, which, at Michelangelo's, is called a 'chai charger'. I've had it before, and I don't remember it leaving any particular impression, good or bad...you can take that as you will. They also have day old pastries that they sell for 50% off (!!!), wrapped up in seran wrap on the counter. I was craving something sweet that day and I grabbed a chocolate croissant (or pain au chocolate, if you want to get really technical). It definitely hit the spot - and honestly, I couldn't even tell that it was a day old!Small menu: gyros and french fries- but if you're in the mood for an awesome gyro, bursting with meat and dripping with juice, and thick delicious french fries, then this is the place to go for lunch, dinner, or late night food. 

atmosphere is like a fast food restaurant, as is the service, but that just means you get to eat your food faster and it doesn't matter if there is a line out the door after bartime.The food is definitely better than the service.  Fries are the best, gyros come with a healthy topping of onions and tomatoes.  Its good if you want greek quick and dirty.Food: 4

3.5 stars, rounding down because they forgot my water. Come here if you want fast, cheap, and decent Mediterranean food.

1. Chicken shawarma, 7 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oezMXnkdUQMuMH7RuKaiyw?userid=2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ
Not bad. Food came out almost as soon as I got a seat, and it was all decent.

If I went to school around here, I'd probably come here pretty often. FYI, they're CASH ONLY.I wanted to try Nepalese food for the first time.  This place was OK...but the flavors def. did not wow me. I'm not sure if it's just the place, or if Nepalese food just isn't my deal.  Either way, this was decent food but I doubt if I'd ever return to this spot, sorry.  Portions are small, service was slow...oh and cash only.The food here is really delicious but way overpriced. I could stand the high prices if the portions were big, but they're not - in fact, they're tiny. And I'm not one of those people who demand outsized American-style portions large enough to feed three people either. But $13.95 for what appears to be a half-order size of a dish made up of tofu and vegetables, really? Did you know tofu is cheap? 

I used to live in NYC where I would get equally good Himalayan food (see Cafe Himalaya in the East Village) that was half as cheap with portions twice as big. Did I mention this was in overpriced New York City!!! I think Himal Chuli would see much more traffic if they changed up their business model a bit--more food with cheaper prices. This is a college town, after all.I had the Palungo Chicken. It was a good meal, but nothing special! It is described as "a generous slice of white meat," but the pieces were small and the meat wasn't very high quality. The dish was way overpriced for its size-  I do like smaller servings at restaurants (it did fill me up perfectly!) but I don't feel like I got great quality or size for paying $15.99. The soup they served before the meal was good, but again, not great!Here is the breakdown. The food was absolutely DELICIOUS. I craved it again the minute I got home from dinner. 

The reasons I am not giving it was because out waitress was appalling. The place is a hole in the wall. There were probably 6 tables inside and maybe 6 very small tables outside. Our waitress was swamped with a full house when we arrived so we didn't mind that it took her a long time to give us menus and water. After people started clearing out and we were one of one two tables dining inside we would have to all three stare her down to try and ask for more water. Which she wouldn't even look at us and just blast by. We would have to shout to get her attention. The first time she returned with the whole pitcher and just said "Here. I will give you the whole thing." Which filled the 3 small cups once. So we had to again shout at her after she would walk past us twice without acknowledging us. 

Lastly, the bill comes and we ask her to split it since we all only have cards. She then informs us that it is cash-only. We were trying to figure out what to do, she points us in the direction of an ATM and storms off rolling her eyes.

There is no sign anywhere that says they do no accept cards. My friends' sister had to run home and grab a check. 

With all that being said, I would still probably return even though there food is kind of pricey.was staying at the hilton and didn't want to order room service, the weather was bad outside so decided to treat myself to a nice dinner. my server was very nice and provided wonderful service.  she told me about the half orders of the sides and mentioned how generous the a la carte portions were. 

i had the chopped salad (half order) and the prime rib and mashed potatoes (half order) and i really enjoyed every bite. couldn't finish the prime rib and potatoes so i consumed when i returned home.Sunroom is a quaint, cozy place on the second floor of a building on State Street. It's a great place to get a cup of tea and a light snack and the place certainly does get a lot of natural light.

I liked their chai, which tasted fresh and unusual. I don't remember having any food there, but they do serve sandwiches and hummus-type dips with chips.What drives me here...location.  Their breakfast is ok however their dinner options are way better.  What I dislike most about the place is that you have to get up and pick up your meal at the front counter (typical during breakfast and possibly lunch times).  On weekends there is a huge bottleneck when ordering....Not a bad spot for breakfast and dinner is probably underrated. Just nothing to really put it over the top. Food is OK. Location is nice. A change of pace from the bagels and pastries that are the only other options on this end of state street. Cheap eggs toast and potatoes special on weekdays.This place is very convenient, if you're staying at the Madison Concourse Hotel, it's just around the corner and down the block.  It's also hilarious, they have a sign advertising tours, and a tourist brochure with a map (points off for spelling, bananas, incorrectly), for a place that is about the size of the Madison Concourse hotel rooms (not the luxury suites, the regular rooms), only it's triangle shaped (maybe that's obvious).  I don't think the employees have bad attitudes, I think it's an affectation, they're being ironic.  Well I didn't spend that much time in there, but I did go back, it's pretty convenient.Cap Centre is conveniently located and have a decent selection. Their prices aren't the best and their produce is pretty average. I like that they have a free item with a $20 purchase, the Moocho deal they did last year saved me a bunch, and their reduced price food area sometimes hold treasures.

If you're on campus, this is a solid place to buy groceries.I went there with couple of friends for lunch. The atmosphere was classic yet casual, and the server was attentive to our need of quarters for parking and tea refills. =P 

The flavor of the sandwich is well balanced--you can taste the individual ingredients and their quality. The fries fill you up if you're still hungry after the small sandwich. 

It's a good place to have a chatty lunch.Really good thai-ish food with a twist, which I can appreciate. It's a nice change of pace from regular day to day thai. They also have a really impressive asian beer selection.

The restaurant interior and the service is pretty crappy, but the low low prices make up for it.

Give it a try, but watch out for all the students.Headline: uninviting, great Dorowat, first-Ethiopian-success

My colleague and I were just in Madison for the day so we decided to stop into Buraka for a late lunch. It's a little uninviting at first since it's located in the basement of the building, but once you get downstairs it's fairly open and friendly. 

This was my first time having Ethiopian food so I went for the house special, the Dorowat, which my colleague described as the "Pad Thai of Ethiopian food." I really enjoyed the dish; the flavors weren't as unfamiliar as I expected they might be. Also, the waitress made me think that it was going to be spicy, but it was rather mild, still to my liking--the spicy sauce that comes out on the side is really hot though! The Injera bread was pretty good too, but next time I'll try the rice. 

All-in-all, I enjoyed my experience and I'll give Ethiopian food another go soon!This review is for the food cart on Library Mall, which I hope is still operating despite the fact that their storefront location has been forced to close its doors thanks to the development plans on State Street. 

If not, at least I can say I tried it! 

So I went with the chicken peanut stew with red potatoes and lentil salad wrapped in injera, and while it wasn't something I'd come running back for, it was slightly satisfying on the cold day that I was able to enjoy it.

This selection was unique, but all of the components did work well together to formulate a cohesive, hearty dish. I would have perhaps appreciated more chicken, but maybe that's just me and my protein-obsessed-self. I just felt that the dish was a tad heavy on the carbs, what with the red potatoes and the lentils and the injera (Ethiopian sourdough flatbread). 

I must say that the injera took me by surprise. I was expecting the typical flatbread dough, yet the injera was unexpectedly thin (almost crepe-like, yet still dense) and had a rather sour taste to it, resemblant of the taste you get from your average sourdough loaf, though much more pronounced. 

I also appreciated the peanut stew/sauce component. The flavors were great and welcomingly savory. 

While the chicken peanut stew wouldn't be my first choice in a return visit, it did make for a decent meal.In comparison with Takara, I think this is a better place. (and I'm Japanese, so I think I know what I'm talking about). Their lunch menu runs from $6-$9, so  it's not too bad for students but it's not the dirt cheap option  either. I had a Bento box lunch ($8) which came with very tasty California Roll, also tasty teriyaki snapper, salad and croque that I didn't care to eat, a bowl of rice, and choice of miso soup or sumashi (clear soup).  - Yes, that's a lot of food indeed. 

The service was good, too. I was actually impressed by our waitress (not Japanese, not even Asian) handling the questions from my Russian friend very well. 

Over all, a positive experience. I'd come here again and try the a la carte sushi.MY 2nd/3rd time here; Jennie & I had lunch here last Thursday to begin an afternoon of shopping and cascading down State St in the sparse and rare 76 degree weather here in Madison.

As you know, we usually do Takumi near E. Towne but I wanted to shop & I am NOT a mall rat.

Wasabi is small, quaint and the sushi chefs were quite friendly; Jennie ordered the Tempura Udon with I can't remember what roll.  I ordered a California Roll as an appetizer and the Teriyaki chicken (white meat only for an extra $1.50) w/ miso, veggies & white rice.  My chicken was a bit on the dry side; not succulent.  Veggies were crisp, my two (2) glasses of plum  wine were spot on and the soup was hot.

Waitress was pleasant but brought my roll after my main meal - hurumph...

Our total bill came to around $47 & change.

I may return, but maybe just for some rolls.

Pros:  Kick ass plum wine.
Cons:  Please have my appetizer come BEFORE my entree, please.It's ok, I guess. I've been here couples of times, but nothing ever fascinates me. Standard service, standard food.My biggest gripe: The employees either need to step up their game or management needs to hire more employees. It is the middle of summer and I would expect an ice cream shop to be up-staffed in anticipation of the increase in customers. For the amount of foot traffic that the Chocolate Shoppe gets between 7-9PM on a warm summer night, they are seriously, seriously understaffed.

I'm not one to complain about standing in line for 15-30 minutes for a scoop of ice cream (especially if I'm craving it), but unfortunately, Chocolate Shoppe doesn't really deliver. There are many flavors, yes, but I feel like the quality of the ice cream they serve is way too commercial (read: overly processed). I could probably pick up a no-name pint of the same flavored ice cream at the Copps down the street and not be able to tell the difference. 

Given the other options in the area (including UW's own Babcock Hall Dairy Store), it will be a long while until I'm back.I would definitely go here again if I was craving Asian food in Madison.

The beef and chasiu (pork) won ton noodle soup was delicious.  They do the meat really well. 

The noodles on the other hand were just okay.  The egg noodles in the won ton soup tasted like they were from a package. The Curry Ho Fun noodles were a decent texture, but the curry sauce left something to be desired. 

As a Chinese Restaurant in Madison: 4 stars
If this restaurant was in SF Bay Area: 3 starsI would be willing to try Bandung again but I would say my first experience was disappointing. 

I had checked out their menu online and was debating between getting delivery or just picking it up myself. I decided to pick it up myself because there was a note that said it would take up to 45 mins. I called and placed my order and was told it would be about 20-25 mins.

I got there on time and I had to wait an additional 20 mins. I'm a patient person but if that was the case I would have gotten delivery. Also if you place your order online the prices reflect if you opt for delivery not if you pick it up (prices are higher), just an FYI. I was not given a total before hanging up so so I ended up paying more than I would have liked. 

The indo mac I would say had a great flavor to it. But I was hoping for a lot more chicken and veggies and felt like it was 75% just noodles. The lumpia was neither good or bad just average I would say.

They do trivia on Monday nights if you are looking for a place to go!There was this guy who worked there awhile back (I'm putting it in the past tense because I haven't seen him in about a year) who was tall, bald and had facial hair reminiscent of Abe Lincoln.  

Anyway, that guy was kind of an idiot. He did a lot of mumbling about some stupid band he was in and would practice air guitar while he stood behind the counter. Hello, I'm there to buy toilet paper, not listening to some weirdo wax poetic on lyrics he wrote about flying away on some airplane. I can only imagine what the girl he wrote those lyics about thinks of him. 

Whatever, dude should have been working and not standing around admiring the flaming guitar heart tattoo on his forearm. I can't think about the Market Basket without associating it with that choad.Had lunch here today and ordered the Tavuk Dolmasi
(Tender chicken breast stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and feta cheese  with a choice of a raspberry-burgundy or a strawberry-mango sauce) It was served with rice pilaf and a salad. for $9.00.

I thought it was good and a good value, would eat here again but would probably go with something less sweet and in a yougurt sauce.

The location on State St makes it a fun place for people watching while enjoying a nice meal. The staff was friendly and attentive.One of the main reasons why I like the Saz, is because it is NEVER overwhelmingly busy. There is always a place for you and three or five other friends to sit.  When Mediterranean Cafe has customers out the door, and the generic State Street food court crap won't do... this is when the Saz is the place to go.  (Motto:  The Saz, always the bridesmaid never the bride.)
Their selection of salads is reasonably priced and usually quite good.  The staff can sometimes be impatient if you don't know what you want right away  I have thoroughly enjoyed both their "Greek" fare and their "Mexican" themed items. There is lots of vegetarian options, and they definitely have more than enough choices for the meat eaters.
The biggest problem I have with the Saz is they don't take credit cards. I understand the food is quite cheap, but sometimes I'm a hungry girl with no cash and no ATM balance.Welcome to a dive bar that is a dive bar without irony.  Home of fantastic gigantic long islands sold in mason jars.  The Red Shed tends to attract college kids and dudes going to games. There's table soccer, darts, and pool.  I have good word this place hasn't changed since the 1970's.The 'dise is closest thing Madison has to a punk bar but no worries, this place has just about zero pretension.  Dark and probably dirty (it's really too dark to tell), this bar is known for it's no frills atmosphere and tasty bar food.  

Stop in and order some cheap beer and a burger but don't expect to be 'seen'.  The patrons are too busy staring into their drinks.The Pub(e) is back and better than ever (they remodeled in summer 2009)

Much less sketchy (but still has the feel), and looks a lot better on the inside - fun college bar at heart.

Cheap drinks- $6 pitchers of Miller Lite, dancing, and pool are what I know it for.Stopped in here for some flavored ice coffee over the weekend.  The barista went out of her way to make sure our drinks had enough syrup added.  So no complaints on the coffee portion of our visit ... until using the coffee bar.  The coffee bar was rather dirty.  They had simple syrup sweetener available that looked like it was years old with crystals  on the bottom.  They provide a water jug with plastic cups... but I couldn't tell which cups were clean.  

Before leaving we used the bathroom, the upstairs smelled horrible like BO and uncleaned bathrooms.  The decor of the upstairs and the bathroom left much to desire, it felt uninviting and out dated.

For our next Sunday Stroll on State street, I think we'll try one of the other coffee shops.Grade: C-

Maybe I just picked the wrong menu item...all 3 times I've eaten there. Great service and Martinis. Spendy.Had escargot for the first time .. Interesting not sure ill ever try that again but the salmon was goodAverage place for a campus restaurant.  We just had maragaritas and chips and guac/salsa.  The margaritas were tasty, not the best, but tasty.  The salsa tasted like pizza sauce with tabasco and the guac was pretty boring.  But drinks outside on State St. made it worth it.Decent sandwiches and bonus points for spicy fries (more places should have spicy fries).  But unforunately, there's not much to make this place stand out.

Swing by in the summer and grab a table outside for some great people watching on State Street.Hawks at first glance looks like a nice sit down with wait service but to my surprise it was entirely all on you to order, pour your water, grab your silverware and condiments (no theyre not on the table), and grab your food from the window! I saw several mislead people who walked in, sat down and waited at their table for a waitress that never came. They eventually figured it out...

The food was good. Looked great but didn't live up to the presentation as much as I had hoped.The Irish Pub isn't going to win any awards compared to other establishments along State Street, but I've got a history with the place and even though I can clearly see all the defects and downsides I still keep coming back.  The Irish has the kind of feel of a blue-collar neighborhood-type bar where the bartenders are chilly to newcomers and the regulars rule the roost.  What is incongruous about this is that the Irish is not off Packers or Milwaukee or the like, it's right on State.  I haven't been here all that often on weekend nights and the few times that I have I remember it being crowded and loud.  My favorite time to stop in for a drink was right after class or nowadays work.  I'd grab the paper and have a beer or three before heading back to my place and the Irish was the perfect destination for this purpose.  

Even with all of the negatives I don't think I've ever really had a bad experience at the Irish Pub, though I'm sure that I've got a case of the rose-colored glasses when it comes to this place.  This just so happens to be my first Madison bar.  Back when I was a sophomore I was fortunate to know one of the bartenders and although I was underage she'd allow me to stop in for a beer when she was working.  Since she worked at another place at night I always went there in the afternoons and the habit has stuck with me through the years.  I like the attitude of the place in the afternoons - it's laid back and casual, with the music turned down a bit and room to spread out a paper and complete the crossword.  The taps aren't too bad but nothing really stands out.  I think I usually get a Guinness, Smithwick's or NG Fat Squirrel when they've got it.  The bartenders have always been pretty friendly with me but I have been a semi-regular since 2000.  The bathroom is small and unwieldy as everyone says, but when you're not staying the entire night it's not too much of an issue.  I've never tried the food since I'm usually there between lunch and dinner hours.

The juke is one of my favorites in town though I did find the hard way that the queue can fill up hours long on a weekend, leaving one $5 poorer with no songs to show for it.  There is also a few tables upstairs - nothing secret about it, but it does make for a nice place to stake out if you've got a group on the weekends.  All in all it might take a few years but this place grows on you.Kabul is a nice joint when you're looking for Middle Eastern food. They usually have two or three dishes which can be made vegan with simple fixes. One of their dishes is a wonderful mixture of herbs, spices, chickpeas and spinach. Portion sizes are good and prices are reasonable, in the $9-12 range. They also have excellent hummus and pita bread. If they had more vegan options, I'd give them a higher rating.You won't get a bad meal here, you won't get a great one.  If it were the only Afghan place in town I'd probably go occasionally, but there's another one I like better, Maza, right across the street.  Bottom line:  I wouldn't object if a friend wanted to eat here, but I'd never pick it myself.3 1/2 Stars***Decent entree. Had the lamb with spinach and rice. Really enjoyed it. The hummus was bland though. Service was better than expected. I ordered an extra rice to go, and was not charged. Nor was i charged for my club soda. 

Will return.When I was in college, Echo was where all my hip student radio station friends would go in search of stories that would make you cringe come Sunday morning. It was dingy enough to satisfy dive bar needs but sketchy enough to make you seem edgy in comparison to all your Plaza-going friends. White girl from the suburbs of Minnesota needs all the edge she can get.

Echo has since been revamped as of last summer or so and while I miss some of the "edge", I usually get by just fine as I'm conquering one of their delicious, giant calzones. Also, after [an attempt at] playing tennis last week, my friend introduced me to the fact that Echo dishes out 5 tacos for $4 on Thursdays. Nothing compliments tennis quite like tacos so we nabbed a table inside, grabbed a beer and placed our orders with the friendly waiter. He looked at us with an eyebrow raised (probably having confused us with Maria Sharapova and Anna Kournikova) and asked whether we were planning to share the 5 tacos. Ha - silly, rabbit. "That'll be 5 tacos each please."

Nothing crazy unique going on here but it's a comfortable venue with an adequate beer selection, enjoyable bar food and saucy-ish tennis players.I live around the corner and find that it's a nice corner bar but the service is hit or miss ranging from good to abysmal. Not that anyone is rude; they're simply overwhelmed and understaffed at times. 

Good bar food, good beer, cozy place. Wish I could give them a better rating.My husband and I took a short road trip to Madison for Memorial Day weekend. I found a decent price online for the Edgewater and was thrilled to have a lakeview room. The hotel is old, not the nicest I've been in, but its history was not lost on us. The common areas smacked of old school glamour. We loved having drinks on the Pier, overlooking Lake Mendota on a nice night. Rooms were very clean, but I have a weird thing about ugly bedspreads and lawdy, those bedspreads could've used a facelift. Sorry, just me. I would stay again, though. Location really can't be beat.I think I have had some of the world's best pizza - John's Pizzeria in NY, Mozza and Abbott's in LA and I gotta be honest, Ian's doesn't really measure up. That said, I get why this place is so beloved in a college town like Madison: unique flavors, eco-friendly products, late hours, and cheap prices.  The mac 'n cheese slice is good, how can cheese, pasta, and pizza crust be bad?, and I tasted the weekly special - crawfish, spicy sausage, and peppers. It was just okay. Overall, you could come here to try some stomach-churning flavors of pizza like BBQ steak and fries, Chicken burrito, and BBFAT (black beans, feta, avocado, tomato) but if I come back to Ian's, I'll probably stick to the simpler fare.Ian's Pizza ist ein recht guter Laden,

um auf die Schnelle ein Stück Pizza zu kaufen.
Die Pizza ist typisch amerikanisch, sehr fettig und groß.

Ob man komplette Pizzen bestellen kann, bin ich mir nicht sicher.

Aber man kann sich einzelne Stücke aus der Auslage aussuchen.

Man kann die Pizza gleich vor Ort essen. Jedoch ist dieser Platz

nicht besonders einladend.
Ian's Pizza ist nichts besonderes aber auch nicht schlecht.Mac n Cheese pizza!!!!!! What else do you want me to write?

This place is good. Not awesome. I think they get so much attention for the ridiculousness of some of their offerings. I mean, Chicago Dog Pizza? Really? I love me a Chicago Dog and I love me some pizza but I'll keep those two separate. I dont need a sliced up hot dog on my pizza. Great job on the mac n cheese pizza though. Very original and pretty damn tasty. When I wake up from my carb coma, I'll write more......I am not a huge pizza fan so that may influence my review a little bit. 

I have only been to Ian's once, around bar time on a weekend night.  The line was of course out the door, and filled with drunk people.  I didn't mind the wait at all.  The pizza was good, nothing I crave or anything, but it was good.  The workers were frantically slaving away in the kitchen.  The pizza I wanted was taken by the man in line in front of me so I quickly chose some Hawaiian style pizza that caught my eye.    Either way, I was hungry and wasn't about to have them make me a slice specially for me. Great for drunk munchies.... not sure I would go here sober.For some reason, the older dude behind the counter reminded me of a retired sailor. Who knew this type of food originated in the UK? I was berated for not knowing this is traditional Scottish food. 

I do enjoy their chicken pasty with white sauce and vegetables. It is so big, it is almost heavy! Seriously! I think I gain like 3 pounds consuming a whole one. It tastes like a doughy chicken pot pie in a shape resembling a gignormous stromboli on steroids. However, they are supremely messy to eat and I have to sit down on a bench to eat one, because I lack the balance to nosh on one and walk down the street at the same time. My boyfriend said it's entertaining to watch me eat one. Be sure to seriously do a face check after finishing so you don't look like a slob.Considering my friends from College Part 1 wanted to plan for an early March reunion (and it's friggin cold that time of year), I was definitely voting for all of us to stay somewhere close to State Street. It is true it is pricey but it's right in the middle of everything.  Our room was clean, parking is free, and aside from some drunk 45 year old woman soliciting me and my boyfriend for a threesome, my experience with the University Inn was generally positive.Gino's is the only restaurant in Madison that serves an authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza. Because if Uno's counts as Chicago style, then Taco Bell must be traditional Mexican cuisine. This is a significant achievement in Wisconsin, or really anywhere outside of Chicagoland.

It's not as good as your average Chicago-style...but at least it is proper Chicago-style. Thick crust, thick and gooey mozzarella, tomato sauce on top, meat and veggies on the inside. At no less than 2 inches thick, two slices are a large and filling meal. To a homesick Illinoisan, it's an acceptable stand-in.

I think that their tomato sauce's spices could use a little work, and I've always gotten pizzas that felt like they were in the oven just a couple minutes too long. The crust is a little grainy, and lacks the subtle pillow-like quality found inside a great Chicago crust. Gino's has gotten the cheese right, though, and they understand that a Chicago-style can and should be stuffed with veggies. They've honored my requests to stuff it with spinach and mushroom before, which would indicate that they aren't pre-made. It's a little weird they don't offer a spinach-stuffed pizza, but some places have the nerve to write Chicago all over their menu and not even keep spinach in their kitchen.

Which, by the way, Gino's does not. The Chicago-style is humbly hidden under "stuffed pizzas" on the Gino's menu. No mention of our fine city can be found anywhere on Gino's menu, website, or advertising.

You cheeseheads should consider yourselves in a debt of gratitude. We've provided you with the blueprint for the closest taste to heaven you'll ever find on a pizza. I hope one of you gets the bright idea to put all that good cheese to proper use, using Gino's commitment as a guiding principle. Legit Chicago pizza is a very rare find outside of Chicagoland. Most Americans unfamiliar with the area will never know what it is actually like to bite into the heavy crust of the finest style of pizza in the world.Not the cheapest place to get your oil changed...they do offer a $10 off early bird special (7-10am M-F) but the conventional oil will run you about $40. Next door they'll do it for $20. I guess they also wash your windows and vacuum your car, but I can do that myself. They told me I should get all this work done to my car but at least they weren't pushy about it. Also, a lot of the services they offer here you could probably do yourself (ie. clean battery terminals, replace windshield wipers, replace headlight bulb, etc).Johnny's has some absolutely melt-in-your-mouth steaks, OR, some very on-par steaks. It seems to be  hit or miss. I only come here on special occassions as it is quite expensive to make a regular habit of dining here.
But the last time I went I had the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly, it practically melted in my mouth! The wedge salad wasn't bad either, an entire 1/4 of the head of iceberg lettuce with some tangy french dressing! And topping it off was my Van Gogh espresso vodka on the rocks from the "overpriced" bar....
For the prices you pay I did expect a bit more.One of the few real steakhouses in the Madison area.  I started with the french onion soup which was very good.  Couldn't try any of the appetizers because I'm allergic to fish.  Went with the 14 oz. tenderloin for dinner and it was very good.  Always get my steaks medium and they cooked it right.  One knock on this place is that it's very expensive.  Good food but smaller portions.  Service is usually very good and friendly.These bagels are fine, but I think their drinks are yummy. I like the blackberry lemonade. 

The interior is sterile, but air conditioned with clean bathrooms and on state street that is saying a lot.Keep your eyes peeled for the daily special! They scribble it on the little chalkboard stands that they leave in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the cafe. 
 
So far as I know: 
Tuesday is two-punch day (for your punch card).
Wednesday is $2 latte day.
Friday is chai day.

For a caffeine addict like me, everyday is coffee day. (:Went in after the Farmer's Market last Saturday. The food was good but the employees were obviously not happy to see our kids there. We ordered a hot cocoa for my daughter which was entirely too hot (steaming). I approached the counter and explained that the drink was meant for my six year old and that it was too hot. He kind of argued with me about it and offered to put in ice cubes. I told him that ice cubes wouldn't help, could you add some cold milk? Luckily the small woman behind the counter jumped in to help. The hot cocoa ended diluted and warm with ice cubes. Not the best service. Not sure that we will go there again with the kids. Great place otherwise.I love the margaritas here.  I also like the chips and dip.  This place is best utilized at happy hour, for that reason.Good Ritas, but the meal was a litte underwhelming. My rice and beans seemed to have that look of having been plated hours previously and the pork tacos had no real zing. My wife's rellano was nice but had one too many cheeses stuffed in it. Eat inside for more comfortable tables.Went here for brunch with some ladies this past Sunday.  
I know for dinner this place is definately overpriced for what you get but for brunch, it ws definately reasonably priced for brunch, with most items around $8.  
It was packed when we got there but we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  We went to the bar and got two bloodys and a coffee.  We got the one with the house-made chili infused vodka and it came with an amber beer chaser, for $6.50.
When we got seated we waited, no lie, about 10 minutes before we were approached by a server.  I was just about to go to the host stand when a frazzled server stopped by.  We placed our order and waited, again, for about 30 min to get our food.  I work in the service industry and not even dinner items take 30 minutes... Whatever.
The food was good though and almost made up for the wait.  I originally wanted the mango-pineapple french toast, but they were out of the mango :( so I had the banana walnut french toast... it was really good, and they coat the bread in some type of crunchy crumbs before they grill them!
My friends both got the crab eggs benedict and they loved it! 
At the end of the meal, we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the bill paid and get a box.
 If it wasn't for the shoddy service I wouldv'e given this place 4 stars.Slow service, confused host; but great vibe for brunch w/ mimosas!I have mixed feelings about this place, based on my one dining experience there. Considering it seats 20 people (I counted), it should have a very cozy feel like the french bistros it is trying to emulate. But it came off more like a trendy coffee shop to me. Not that it's a bad thing, I suppose. But the lighting is a bit bright for a romantic meal, and the tables are tiny. Add in the mix of 'cliche diverse art' that Madison seems to think is necessary everywhere, and you get the idea.

The waitstaff, which consisted of one person when I was there, was friendly enough. Not terribly helpful with the wine menu. But there wasn't much of a selection to begin with. The food choices were equally sparse, but I prefer quality over quantity so that wasn't a concern.

And speaking of the food. Yes, it was very good and reasonably priced. I had some sort of porkchop (forgive me, it's been at least a month since I was there) and my date had a vegetarian cous cous dish. Both were excellent.

The waitress was polite and responsive, and seemed  to know when to give us space. But I was a bit turned off when she handed me the bill and never asked if I needed change for my cash. Perhaps it was just an oversight, and not enough of a complaint to taint my impression of the place.

That said, if you want a small place that veers from the usual french motif while providing very good food, this might fit the bill. Beware that the wine list is very pedestrian, and since I consider that an integral part of fine dining, I had to give it 3 stars instead of 4.So just like the Southwest commercials I just had to get away.  So, I got in my rental and headed to Madison.  I ended up at Tutto Pasta Trattoria on State Street.  I like the windows as I walked by and decided to go in.  The place was a lot more narrow that I thought.  I took a place at the bar.  I enjoyed a nice glass of wine and really good pasta dish.  The portions are wayyy to big.  I mean if I had been a plus 1 we could have eaten my one dish. 

The staff was nice but I could see how they could become too comfortable.  The environment is just comfortable and welcomes groups that stay well after the food has been eaten.

Not sure if I will come back to Madison, WI but if I do I will definitely come back to this place.Mediocre in just about every way. Pretty basic Italian food. Not bad, but not particularly good either.I was a little worried about going here after checking out the other reviews. Someone else set up a group dinner here for 12 of us, so what could I do, right ? Well I went in here expecting the worst and wound up pleasantly surprised. 

The place was kind of a tight fit for 12, strange shaped rooms and what not, but whatever. The staff was attentive and stayed on top of everything we needed, bread, keeping drinks filled, whatever. 

The food was OK, we tried a few different appetizers, all decent. The spaghetti carbonara was a a bit on the bland side, nothing some crushed red pepper couldn't take care of. 

So over all, not great, but not terrible either.The food was okay, but with the setting and the hype I'd heard about the place, I expected better. I even had my friends leftovers and his pasta was pretty it was alright, nothing special.Very nice place.  Actually, too nice.  I prefer my bars on the grimy side.

Used to be a cigar bar but the local legislature has put an end to that.  They probably should have been given an exception but that's an arguement for another time.I'm not a smoker.  

However, there IS something about the smell of "Ligero" cigars and sipping an Armagnac.  I don't know, it's sweet, it's lingering, and it's an experience. 

Although it's funny when Joe Scalisi is singing some Frank Sinatra song in the background.  'Cause come on, can you say CLICHE!

It's a good place to just REALLY relax, sip something, and just take the moment in.

Then leave, before your lungs get in smoke overload.I enjoy a cigar now and again but don't know much about how to choose. Maduro is helpful for that reason :) The last time I was there, it was a Saturday night but close to bar time.  It wasn't very busy yet my friends and I ended up standing at the bar for about 10 minutes before being acknowledged.  Regardless, the drinks were strong and so was the cigar!I remember when Charley's Grilled Subs first opened on State, back during my earlier college years.  I remember that when it first opened I was extremely  happy, because for whatever reason I was in a major Philly cheesesteak phase.  It was something I'd always order at restaurants and even make special trips to the West Towne Mall food court to hit up the Steak Escape.  I've never even been to Philadelphia and I probably wouldn't know a good cheesesteak from a bad one.  It didn't really matter - that is what I yearned for, and my wishes were answered when Charley's opened.

Back then I went all the time, usually getting the regular Philly with fries but basically trying everything on the menu.  I probably came here at least once a week in between classes or after a session at Memorial Library.  I'd have to say it was my favorite restaurant in Madison at the time.

Fast forward five years and I'm living in Middleton.  I haven't been to Charley's since college, but my friends and I need to grab a quick bite before the UW Hockey game.  I've been basically out of town for the better part of a month and I get the sudden urge to see if Charley's is as good as I remember.  Short answer: yes!  The Italian Deli sandwich was delicious.  I skipped the fries as I never was a huge fan and went with a large sandwich.  Long answer: not quite so much...  It turns out I'm not used to eating this type of food anymore, and the heartburn became intense around the second period.  I shared this discomfort with my friend, and we both spent the remainder of the night saying "Oh, there goes the Charley's again."I wanted to love this place because it has a sunny sounding name and the interior is filled with light.  On the weekday morning that I visited it was bustling but there were empty seats at the bar and front window to sit with a cup of coffee and breakfast.  Except at 10:30 they had stopped serving breakfast so I had a scone instead - not a painful sacrifice but not the hot breakfast I'd anticipated.  The coffee choices had cutesie names.  I got the Americano, which turned out to be black coffee served in a huge wide mug that was impossible to carry without sloshing.  I sloshed my way to the sugar and cream stand and back to my spot at the counter, leaving a trail of Americano behind. The scone was good.Went for brunch.  I should have trusted my instincts and walked out upon seeing the price for biscuits and gravy = $12.  Instead,  we stayed and had a good--though seriously overpriced and undersized--meal.

My french toast was $10.  Tasty, to be sure, great fluffy texture, cooked perfectly, with several nice sauces poured over the little pile.  And I might've been ok with the price if only there were more on the plate.  But only three triangles of french toast?  Where was the fourth?  (On someone else's plate, I had to assume.)  

What sense does it make to deprive me of that half-slice of French toast?  Surely not pricing sense, as it couldn't cost much of anything.  The berries on the plate were ripe and plump.  But there were a total of two black berries and two raspberries.  For color, I guess.

Can't praise the quality of the link sausages.  A side of three sausages were an extra $3.  They weren't bad.  They were just small, with the most pedestrian flavor, no smoke, no spice, no herbs.  Cooked.  That's all one could really say about them.

So at $13 my plate left me pretty hungry and very sad.  I perfectly expect to pay prices like that for farm to table restaurant food.  But don't let me walk away sad.Living just two blocks away from this weekend brunch mecca, and having bought a $125 gift card for $100 on my first visit, I really wanted to like this place.  
I really, really wanted to.

Food:

Pancakes (Buckwheat, Peach, Buttermilk, etc.): $7-$10
-While they tout using only the freshest and finest ingredients, they don't seem to use enough of them.  The pancakes overall are somewhat bland, and everything tastes similar.  In the end, you're really just eating a maple syrup conveyor.

Duck Confit Hash: $9.95
Judge an ice-cream shop by its vanilla, sure.  But if you put the poultry Inception that is duck confit on the menu, I'm going to try it.
-The duck confit was remarkably dry for something that had supposedly been rendered in its own fat, and definitely was not worth even the ten bucks they were asking.
-While I was hoping it was made into a hash in order to stretch a small quantity of great duck into a larger serving, it seems that the hash was more a method to hide the fact that you were just being served bits of salty duck.


Ambiance:  The real reason I rated this place so low is because of the overall dining environment.  It would be two stars, were it not for the fact that I know I'm going during their busiest times.

If you come here during the weekend, it will be packed.
Chances are, nobody will greet you or explain anything to you, but that's fine as you will have stood in a line by the time you entered the first door.  This line leads directly to the cash register, but does wrap around a pillar that holds the menus, so you can figure out what you want while you watch other people eat.
If you decide to grab a seat before ordering (seems reasonable, right?), you will be informed (loudly enough for everyone else in line to get the memo) that guests should please refrain from trying to get seats prior to ordering.  Alright, message received, the cluster' will begin after you pay.
You'll order, sit down at the waiting area that is pleasantly placed right next to the restrooms, holding your number tag like a branded cow, and desperately look for the next group to leave (It's best to have any females in the party have a scarf or purse handy to drop on the seat to claim territory, as -from experience- other parties will be doing the exact same thing).

The aforementioned just-okay food will arrive, and you can finally eat.  They bring you your coffee as well, and you can finish your meal in relative peace.

--That is--, unless you arrived at a time that they were so busy, that there was still a line as you were finishing your meal.  In that case, their staff is apparently trained to actually ask you to either finish up your conversation and leave, or migrate to a smaller table so that they can seat another party.
Keep in mind, this is about two minutes after you pay your check, and are just trying to drink down the last bit of coffee.  By no means do you need to make any effort to delay your own exit for this wonderful display of hospitality to occur.

What in the absolute hell kind of place, one block away from the Capitol, doesn't have any consistent or fair seating logistic when the line goes out the door, and asks their own patrons to either leave or change tables when they are literally 95% of the way through their meal?


In summary, this location has honestly been a terrible way to start my weekends 3 times out of 4, may be better during weekdays but I do not have the schedule for that, and is really only worth going to if you want to see or be seen by rich housewives taking their preppy children out to brunch.There isn't a great (or even good) selection of tea houses in Madison, this one is kind of hidden away on the east side. Although a bit kitschy, okay maybe a lot, they tried to make my entire group wear various types of hats and were very strict on matching hats to the appropriate gender.

The seating is fun because the seats are of all different varieties, I really digged the mismatchiness of the place. I believe that the building used to be a house, so there are a bunch of different rooms which makes the tea parties feel more private and exclusive, which I enjoyed.

I came here for a birthday celebration, and we were the only guests for the majority of the time. The food was all great, it was displayed beautifully, and there were many choices for tea selections. I didn't like that you could not select which sandwiches you ordered, you simply got a plate of sandwiches...

The worst part of my experience here was the woman who I'm assuming owns the place. She was completely overbearing, and had our tables situated so that in order to serve one half of my party, she had to completely invade the personal space of the other half of my party. She was not very friendly, and tried to make the experience so formal that we all got annoyed pretty quickly. Rather than simply letting us (a group of adults) enjoy our time and the company of each other, she felt the need to bark orders at our tea party experience and make annoying comments. I'd pay extra to make her sit outside and let us serve ourselves.

If I had come here as a little girl for a birthday party, I would have loved it.So I come in here all the time because it's in my neighborhood. The coffee is fine and the staff are largely pleasant, but so much of the time I'm driven to leave earlier than I expected because the music is SO LOUD. There's one barista in particular who just blasts really abrasive music when every single person in the cafe has their laptop open and is working. I wish they'd pay more attention to their customers' needs.It pains me to give Glass Nickle a 3-star but this place has been slipped over the past few years. I used to love it but now it's a "meh" in my mind. I've only had delivery so maybe that has something to do with it but the last four times I've had it the pizza had been made wrong or over-cooked, REALLY late delivery or it just plain tasted bleh. And they are quite expensive so I do expect more from GN and lately they haven't delivered (figuratively speaking).
Don't even try to use the website to contact them about your concerns because they only give you an automated reply.  I'm giving it three stars just because I loved it so much once and hope that the recent experiences have been flukes. Worth a try though if you haven't had it before.Not a bad location; typical GNP - slightly doughy/bready, ample toppings, cooked well. Pizza was ready well before I arrived to pick-it-up, yet the crust and toppings held-up nicely.i guess this place is pretty good.
i'm not sure i'm head-over-heels about it like everyone else is.

the first time i went there, i got one of those 4-egg omelettes that they oven bake.  i was definitely not too keen on it.  yes, it was huge and yes, you could feed an army with it, but i felt like it was overdone 'cuz the crispy burnt outside really distracted from the eggy, hammy goodness on the inside that i wanted to taste.

i actually had avoided going back since then because usually when i brunch i go the omelette route but.. . .

i went back recently for a friend's birthday, however, and tried the combo plate.  i liked that this option existed since it was just 1 egg (cooked however you want it), 1 sausage patty (or whatever meat option) and 3 buttermilk pancakes.  it was like i got to have all the different foods but in smaller portions so that i could actually eat it all.

a friend got potato pancakes with his eggs benedict which looked awesome!   i'm not sure how you can go wrong with thin fried crispy slivers of mashed potatoes though.  the eggs benedict themselves actually didn't look that great and honestly made me just yearn for the amazing eggs benedict at cafe continental.

the wait was 45 minutes at noon on sunday.  yes, it's the sunday brunch crowd, but that's quite a wait.  
i'm hungry and i'm hungry now.

one point off for the wait.
one point off for the omelette.

one point for extensive menu.
one point for good combo plate and those potato pancake things.
one point for good service.

you have won me back for now, original pancake house.
don't let me down.This place was pretty good. The food was decent (I don't know how to mess up breakfast food), but not spectacular. 

I had an egg/pancake/bacon combo and it was pretty cheap. 

The bacon was done to perfection. A little crispy, a little chewy. The pancakes weren't very large or particularly delicious. The eggs were done just about right.

There was also a pretty long wait. I don't like waiting, especially if the food isn't the best. I doubt I will ever plan on going here again, but if somebody were to invite me, I wouldn't say no.Updated review, based on visit of 11/26/13.

Met my team here for a morning breakfast meeting; quickly seated (table of 8).

+ Server, Daniel, was PHENOMENAL - friendly, fast, efficient, and just plain excellent
+ Coffee/water refills were always available; never sat with an empty anything
- I drank too much coffee

+ Good selection of breakfast staples
+ Veggie omelet was excellent - very big, could only eat half
- Eggs were slightly overcooked; a little tan in spots
- I suspect there is pancake batter mixed-in with the omelets

- Cash only
+ ATM onsite

So... based on service: 5-stars. All things considered, a solid 3 stars.This Copps store is making strides in becoming a much better store than it used to be.
Bigger produce selection, good meat/seafood selection, and all the basics you need for every week grocery shopping.  Good prices, too.
Roundy's brand items are great! 
Now if they can just stop packing fruit at the bottom of the bag!!Selected the "lake perch" for Friday dinner.  Delicious!  Cole slaw was in very large chunks and not particularly tasty.  Nice dinner roll, but who needs bread and french fries.  Great, efficient waitress.  Very, very casual dress. A bit loud.  This is not the place for a quiet Friday night dinner, but it's a fairly good fish fry.  They don't take credit cards, but they have an ATM.Nice atomosphere, pretty good food and products except for the hamburger from the meat case which is disgustingly fatty crap.  Some of the workers look like sasquatch behind the deli cases, and that could make a person think twice about having them touch your food.  I think they are trying to do the whole, "I'm a neo-hippy, anti-establishment, going green dude, so I don't wash my dreadlocks or anything else on my body for six months at a time, and for deodrant I rub rocks on my pits!" thing.  

On the flip side, its fun to cruise the store for free samples and it's nice to have a place to purchase products that don't have lead or mercury in them!Sought this place out because it was across the street from my hotel, but was pleasantly surprised by the service and tasty entree.  I'm not a fish person by nature, but after a long day of tasting cheese I wanted a relatively light dinner and ordered their halibut - served over flavorful mashed potatoes with an awesome creamy (but not heavy!) sauce.  The fish was tender, flaky and moist, really nicely done.  

The goat cheesecake dessert was a lovely cheesecake, but unfortunately drowning in a far too sweet cherry sauce.  I wondered if this was to smother the goat cheese flavor in the dessert - but if someone doesn't like goat cheese, maybe they just shouldn't order the GOAT cheesecake?  

The wine was lovely although it cost twice as much as the one I thought we had ordered... either myself or the server was not watching my companion closely enough when he ordered it!I always get excited to go here, but I'm never that impressed with the food. It's good, but not great. Nice atmosphere & staff though.Have been here a couple of times in the 4.5 years that I have been in Madison. The first time I was here was definitely not planned. My roommate and I were heading to Saigon noodles, but they were super busy one evening (before they renovated and expanded the area), hence we stopped by Sai Bai Thong. I have had the pineapple dried rice, which was a pretty nice and interesting dish. The fried rice was contained in the shell of the pineapple instead of on a plate. The natural pineapple flavors infused into the rice, adding a truly refreshing taste to it. I am not sure if this dish is still being served, that was one of their specials some time back. 

Today I dined in again and had the duck curry. Serving is decent and our waitress was good. But I find that the curry is a tad too salty for my taste. Given the price range and the type of food this is not one of my regular go-to places, but once in a (long) while, if I am looking and looking for a place different to eat, I would give it a go.I've been a fan of New Seoul since I moved to Madison. 

The bibimbop is very good. The pulgogi is also very good, but could be cut up a bit more before serving. The portions are a bit large for chop sticks.  The kimchi is very good! I am not a huge fan of the various stir-fry dishes they offer. I had the chopchebop once and have never had it again since. The other stir-fry dishes are OK, but I'm a fan of the bibimbop and will probably only ever order that again. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant leaves something to be desired. The bathroom is often dirty and awkward to get to. The service is usually good, but sometimes the turn-over of the staff seems a bit high and the quality of service suffers. All in all, it's a good place and not too pricey.The beef bulgoki was incredible but not nearly enough for an entree at the price. The rice to dish ratio was certainly heavy on the white sticky stuff, but the food was delicious. This place is a 4-star restaurant at 5-star prices.. which brings it down to a 3-star rating from this guy. It's math. 

I would eat here again and probably still order the over-priced beef bulgoki, it's that good."Average plus" would be an accurate description.
I like the tall ceiling and open feeling. The decor is somewhat basic, but clean and pleasant. They serve Just Coffee (local) here, which is alright, but I wouldn't say awesome.

The lady at the casher was smily, chatty, and fun. When I asked to substitute the bacon that comes with waffle with something vegetarian, she was quick to point me to granola + yogurt option. That was great. I appreciated the flexibility.

The freshly baked waffle arrived at my table. It smelled great, and looked delicious - and was delicious. The only thing is that it had the texture of pancake than waffle - but whatever, I liked this pancake-waffle very much. So the waffle alone should deserve 4 stars. 

I have never been a big fan of their baked goods. I think they are over-rated.I've probably been here more than I should.  I like greasy, juicy burgers and fries.  I always get the California burger.  And their custard...it's rich and smooth and each spoonful is a little bite of heaven.  To each his own, and you'll just have to see what's on the menu that appeals to you, but I'd guarantee your satisfaction.  If I grew up in Madison, this would be a great high school date...wait, do kids still do that?  I was kind of a dork and it's not likely I'd be with a boy in the backseat of his car.  Still, I do see a lot of couples stop by and grab a seat in the lot on the table under the umbrella--obviously a great place to stop for ice cream coming home from a movie.I was in Madison for the holiday weekend and popped into Bluephies for a bite; it'd been since college since I'd visited last.  The space is much larger; definitely welcome as I remember it being a bit cramped.  As another reviewer noted, there are plenty of vegetarian options; I opted for a scrambler with portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and feta cheese.  It was tasty though I think that I would've done something different with the side potatoes...there was something missing that I just couldn't quite put my finger on.  

One other plus is that there is some nice boutique shopping just up the street from Bluephies; if you have some time, you could make a few hours of it.The best thing about Bluephies is their dessert.  I love the chocolate chip cookie dough egg rolls.  The dinner isn't bad but I feel like a majority of the dishes are either a hit or a miss.  It's also pretty spendy.  The service was alright and overall it was a  nice place.Ate here for lunch.  Ordered the Monte Cristo, which was not your traditional Monte cristo, as it had guacamole and tomatoes.  It was generally good.  I substituted the fries with asparagus frites, which were relatively underwhelming - a pretty tasteless beer batter surrounding asparagus that was a little soggy.  My friend had the shrimp quesadilla, which was spicy, but a bit rubbery (he really liked it though).  The redeeming factor here was dessert. We got some cookie dough eggrolls which were pretty tasty, though we argued whether or not it was homemade or just a cheap toll-house type of cookie dough.   

Overall, I'd go back, but probably would order something else.3.5 stars is pretty accurate here as an average. We've eaten here twice, once with guests and once for takeout. Results were highly variable.

The 1st trip was for brunch with another couple from out of town and the food was generally quite good. However, the servers and wait system here is chaotic. There was a long list when we came in and decided to wait the 45 min to be seated. Apparently there's a "wait room" in the front that only serves drinks - no food. Took the server 15 minutes just to come to take our drink orders in the "wait room". Ordered some bloody marys and they were pretty amazing to be honest - had string cheese, asparagus and several other extras in the drink and had a miller high life as a chaser - nice. Finally got seated and ordered food. 3 people got salads and I got pancakes. Everyone seemed to like their salads and my pancakes were some of the best I've had in mad-town. Unfortunately, one from our party lost her keys when we got back from brunch. She called Bluephies and asked if they had found them, and if not, whether she could come right back and look for them - the restaurant was about to close. The person she dealt with on the phone was apparently flippant with her and said something to the effect of "well we're closing and there's nothing you can do". Our friend was pretty upset and was actually brought to tears by this person. Even though she found her keys later in her coat pocket :) - this was pretty rough, snooty treatment IMO for a neighborhoody, EXPENSIVE eatery. They never want to go back - ever.

A few weeks later, we rolled the dice again and ordered takeout. Some taterskin appetizer, the crabcake sandwich and the bbq sandwich. The app was bad and had some weird off-flavored bird meat in it. My crab cake sandwich was absolutely gross. It was huge with butter drenched bread and huge lumps of sub-par crab (I did live near the gulf though) and half-hazardously applied remoulade sauce. The bbq sandwich was also huge (the lady had to remove about half the meat) and she was disappointed there was almost no bbq sauce on the sandwich or provided. So the food was bad this time.

My take home on this place is that it's inconsistent, and can have great food, but you have to roll the dice and then also deal with the service. Don't loss anything there!I travel frequently for office work and I like to try local restaurants as much as I can.

Was driving around monroe street and got into this one for dinner. Thanks to the catchy sign board. 

It has a typical but nice ambience of mexican bar. I was accompanied by my Boss who is Belgian and likes mexican cuisine. Were served by a cute and helpful girl.

A bit disappointment on food taste. My plate looked really nice but did not taste very well. Drinks were really nice though. One of the best Shangria I ever had!Orange Tree has a great selection of kitchen items. Anything you want for your kitchen, you can find here at a reasonable price. Great jewelry by local artists, too. Service could be more attentive, though. Four staffers were having a bonding moment and couldn't be bothered to acknowledge me when I walked in. One woman in the back of the store finally asked me if I was looking for anything in particular, and I figured out that if you actually approach one of the front-deskers, they will help you out. But considering Orange Tree is a boutique store, some extra customer service training would not kill.It's winter.  Cold, snowy, and bleak.  Humbling.  But wherever will you go for some birthday party antics?  

We headed to Vitense to check out their new indoor mini-golf.  Each hole is designed around a Madison landmark with lots of little interactive do-dads.  Requisite gaggle of kids running around and I stopped keeping score after about 10 minutes.  

Fun times but indoor mini-golf can be pretty cramped.  Head back in the summer and check out the outdoor links and driving range.God, it's so shockingly ugly inside here.  We both agreed it looked like a funeral parlor.  

The eggs were ok.The food is not bad.  It's not exciting at all either, but if you want some breakfast for a decent price, it's a good enough spot to stop.  My one warning for you though is do not order the bloody mary.  It is the saddest little thing i've ever ordered.  It was just tomato juice mixed with a shot of vodka and a giant pickle spear.  It was hilariously sad.  Good french toast though.I only ever get the #1 here (Italian).  Because it's good and I like it and what's wrong with that?  There's one guy who makes them better than the others, so I like it when he's there.  I think he puts just the perfect amount of dressing on.  Nothing extraordinary here, but a solidly good sandwich that I can't pass up when I'm in the neighborhood.Fish fry review for 9/27/13.

Met two coworkers for lunch here and decided to try the fish fry. Options include: fried cod, baked cod, or fried lake perch.

I opted for the lake perch; one coworker went with the fried cod; the other chose the blackened tilapia fish tacos. The fish fry includes choice of potato (we both went with curly fries) and a small side of tartar. 

Plates arrived; cod featured three, thick almost cube-like pieces of lightly breaded cod. Perch plate consisted of six modest fillets of perch. Both plates were presented steaming hot and ready to rock.

The perch breading was nicely applied; the fish itself was very mild, with just the right amount of that familiar perchy chew. It was just slightly greasy, as perch often is. 

The cod was even more mild; the breading didn't cling very well, but there were no signs of grease - just flaky, moist, dense cod.

Not a bad fish fry; you could do much worse.A decent enough mexican tex mex place if you absolutely refuse to try to get something worthwhile. It's better than Pedro's but I occasionally miss the free fresh tortillas you'd get there. As the previous reviewer said, thoroughly average.

If you want Mexican but actually want to eat good food instead of filling the empty cavity under your diaphragm, go to Taqueria Gudelajara. You'll save money too.It's cheap Mexican food.
It's hard to really mess up Mexican.

Nothing was particularly bad or good about my visit here. The fish tacos were entirely "meh" as was the guacamole.
I wouldn't say no if I was in town again and my friend wanted to come here again. But I have to believe that there are much better Mexican places on Mad-Town.Great dinner specials (choice of three different dinners for $6 when I went). You get a lot for your value. Food wasn't too bad either. Worth checking out if you live nearby.A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.Let's just put it out there:  You don't get to meet Rocky when you come in.  It's a let down for sure.  

If you're in the neighborhood wanting some lunch, I love this place.  You'll get a good deal on a slice of pizza, their salad bar, and a drink.  

For the pizza?  It's quality stuff.  Think Pizza Hut, but with a more flavorful crust.  I'm also a fan of the rectangle orientation.  Not sure why a rectangle pizza tastes better, but I don't question it.

Bottom line, you won't be disappointed.  It's a quality pizza, and a great place to stop by for a good lunch.Check-in: a breeze. Great friendly staff to greet you. There was plenty of surface lot for free parking, which always makes things easier.

Room: Bedroom was unremarkable. Bathroom was a bit small. I did find some stray hair in the washcloth in the bathroom, which I found to be disturbing at a SPG hotel... Otherwise, a very comfortable, clean room.  I stayed on the club flood and used the club lounge in the morning for "breakfast"... It was just fruits, cereal, and pastries... If you're looking for a hot breakfast, the club lounge won't do anything for you. 

Check-out: again, a breeze. Starbucks in the lobby is a plus. 

Food: Eat before you come out to this hotel... Room service menu isn't very impressive. I went downstairs to the restaurant at 8:30 PM for something- it's typical bar food. Even the bartender doesn't want you to order food because she knows how terrible it is! 

Misc: the only starwood hotel in Madison. It's doable for your loyalty points. It's very close to the highway, so it's very easy and convenient to just hop on to get to wherever you need to go. It shaves 10 minutes of driving through the crazy one-ways of downtown Madison from some of the other hotels.Food was decent-good portions. Maybe the sticky menu just threw me off.Mixed bag. 
The music is alright, and the resident dancers are cute and fab and I want to pinch them. But I'm not sure about the unmotivated crowed just standing there at the edge of the floor and staring ....  not that hot.

I left there with this awful nagging feeling. Hmm, I wanted have fun, but maybe in another life, kinda thing.after a few beers at the mason lounge, we stopped into falbo bros. and ordered a pizza for carry out. there were only three of us in the store but for some reason it took forever to get our order. their pizza is decent, but they need to speed it up.I come to Fraboni's occasionally for Italian goodies and decent sandwiches.

The deli sandwiches aren't spectacular but they're reliably passable. They don't taste very authentically Italian, but they make for a good cheap lunch on days I forget to pack something. I probably wouldn't eat here if it weren't for their convenient location. There's also free parking in the back, so +1 for that.

The variety of pasta they have is amazing. Very authentic and pretty reasonably priced. They have packaged gnocchi that's awesome and turns out perfect and fluffy every time. Much better than big brand gnocchi you find at other grocery stores like Trader Joe's. I love that they have a wide selection of arborio rice to make risotto. Usually arborio is hard to find in this town. 

To comment on their sauces: I made spaghetti with their house-made spaghetti sauce and it tasted sort of funny. It kind of tasted like tomato soup, but with the consistency of pasta sauce. Weird. They had some different fancyish brands of pasta sauce that I've been wanting to try. 

All of their sweet items (chocolates, cookies, cannolis, etc.) seem WAY overpriced. The Ritter bars are like $4.50, and I can get those for about $2.50 at TJ's. Similarly, I noticed that the Lindt chocolate bars are double the price you'd pay elsewhere. Try to avoid the sweet items here, unless you're looking for an italian brand that you absolutely can't find anywhere else. I'm intrigued by their frozen section. They have lots of frozen pizzas/pastas that look yummy but I have yet to try any.I used to live right next to the regent st. location.  It was a good place to get some good pizza.  They always had some coupon or deal in the onion so I'd go here once or twice a month.So, I've been back here a few times since my initial surgery. My faith in this place has kind of faltered. It's not the worst, they're clean, and they're professional. They don't have a high rate of dentists coming and going and they did a pretty good job on my mouth and my surgery.

So why am I dropping it? It's a little long, but bear with me because it's pretty legit.

I got an infection shortly after having it; this isn't their fault, but I was out of town. I initially called them about setting up a return appointment just to check on things and the receptionist said, "Oh! You don't need to come back unless you're in pain!"--which, I thought was kind of weird because after most surgeries (I've never had one myself, but I'm going on family and friends' histories here), your health provider would like to see you in case something DOES go wrong. Here's detraction reason #1.

And it sort of, in a minor way, did. As I said, I was out of town. I went to a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, IA who gave me a check up and noticed the minor infection. When they got my file from this place, they noticed that I was prescribed Amoxicillin.

Except, I never got it. My dad was given all my pharmaceutical prescriptions shortly after leaving and Amoxicillin was not on that list of ones given to us. I had to explain to the Cedar Rapids dental surgeon that no, I never received it, so I'd have to be put on Clindamyacin. That went off without a hitch, fortunately, but if you prescribe someone something like an antibiotic and they don't have it? That's a little side-eye worthy right there. They also told me it was kind of weird that they didn't have a scheduled appointment to see me after the surgery. Ugh. Detraction reason #2 and #3.

I came back because the pain in my jaw didn't go away. It wasn't a dry socket, per se--just in the jawline. When I came back to visit, the dentist had kind of an air of "Ugh, you again?" and kind of seemed dismissive. I dunno. I'm probably being too sensitive, but that was the feeling I got. Detraction reason #4. I just got my clove strip, went home, came back two days later and had it out.

I still think these guys are pretty good and definitely ought to be considered if you're having dental surgery, I just got rubbed the wrong way with some of the run-around.Have been coming here since I was legal, which is not as long as other establishments in Madison.  The reason is that Wando's is not a place you go to if your are underage.  Their reputation of keeping all the kids out is appreciated.  Sometimes and it is becoming more often now I just want to be drinking with other adults and not drunken kids.  

Wandos offers great specials during the week highlighted by bacon night every tuesday.  The bacon goes fast so you gotta get there early.  The $1 PBR and Coors Light washes all that delicious fat down.

The knock against wandos is that the bartenders in general suck.  Not sure how they got jobs there, but they don't seem to know the difference between Miller Lite and Guinness.  I don't dare order a mixed drink there because its either not what I ordered or super weak.

Over all its a good place to drink before a game.  There is always people there and the multiple floors make the experience more intimate.With a recent move from the now defunct University Square, Paisan's boasts an excellent terrace overlooking Lake Monona.  The interior keeps the dark intimate booths from the old location with a nice expanded bar.  

As far as the food, the porta salad is pretty top notch.  However, the rest of the dishes are merely average.  The sauces are either too bland or too rich and the pizza, while adequate, isn't anything to write home about.Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service.I think a solid 2 to 3 stars is in order here. For $10 you get a wash and wipe down. I don't see any reason to pay anything over. It's a deal in my eyes.

I enjoy the extra streak free wipe down at the end, nothing makes me more angry than streaks after a wash!!!!
I've also paid for a full detail/steam clean at this location.

I did it before I traded in a SUV I had to make it look like it was worth at least a couple grand (wishful thinking). They did a great job, but because it was in December...the seats were still wet for the next 2 days from the steam clean. They just didn't want to dry out! I wish they would have dried them out or something for me! 

Not to mention, they didn't clean under the hood it looked like, which I'm not sure even if it was a part of the detail or not....but either way I asked the sales guy for a full detail and was hoping to have this done (or at the very least wiped down quickly) considering how much $$$$ I was paying. This is my fault I guess for not looking before I drove away. 
Well....you can't win them all.
Either way, a great $10 wash.A regular lunch spot for me, I generally prefer Cousins over Subway.  Cousins has seven inch half sandwiches (as opposed to Subways six inchers) and for some reason, that extra inch really makes a difference for me (I can't upgrade to a whole sandwich because that's too much).  I also enjoy the fact that you don't have to specify yes or no for every single sandwich fixing, which is a major annoyance for me at Subway.  The employees are friendly and they have all the regular goodies that you might expect (e.g., fresh-baked cookies, chips, etc.).Firstly why is it called Famous Daaves BBQ?
1. Who is Dave?
2. Is Dave really famous?
I walked in, curious to try the food. The decoration is cute, lots of sign boards everywhere. My waiter was pretty awesome. We had 6 bottles of BBQ sauce on our table and he explained every single one of them, the flavor, how hot / sweet it was, what it was made of. Then he brought us a plate of potato chips so we could try each sauce. I liked the original and the sweet/zesty one. I was afraid of trying the XXL sauce because it was super spicy. Spicy food makes me cry.
I ordered from the lunch menu and decided on the St. Louis ribs. It came with a corn muffin, corn on the cob and your choice of side, I had broccoli.
When my food came, I only had 3 ribs.  I was expected at least half a slab. St. Louis ribs aren't that great, the meat isn't that tender and there is too much fat. Baby back ribs are so much better, baby ribs are always WINNING!
The corn muffin was excellent. Corn on the cob, can't say much, just has lots of butter so it tastes good.
At the end of the meal, the waiter gave us a free bottle of original bbq sauce.This was a tough one for me to write as overall I like Famous Dave's quite a bit but I have had a couple of "not so good" experiences as of late, and I thought I should let people know about them.

FIRST - Do not get take out from this location - I cannot comment about other locations but this one is just not good. It seems to me they save the best ribs for those dining in and give the old, dry, cold ones to the take out people.....BOOOOOOO. 

Secondly - the restaurant as a whole just seems to be in decline. We live very close to this location and I drive by it regularly and it just seems to always be very slow around the place. Not sure if it is the poor quality of food they are putting out or what but something should change. 

I absolutely love ribs and their sauces are the best but come on Famous Dave.....get your quality back up and maybe just maybe you will get people back in the door.I have a mixed feeling about this place, it took me a while to decide whether to give this place a 2 or 3 stars.
I personally don't like this place as much, the foods were so-so but I can't say anything very negative about it either. I have been to this place few times, not because I crave for a good Chinese food or because I love one specific dish, but simply because there wren't many other choices around Madison. That is, when I feel like Chinese foods but don't want to go to Fugu or HK Wok. 
I prefer to go to a restaurant specialized in one type of cuisine, and I'm always confused what to order in restaurants like Nam's because they have Thai, Chinese, Viet, etc. Why would they do that? I think it's because they don't have any special dish that is their forte. For this particular place, however, always gofor the Chinese and go someplace else for Thai and Viets. The Chinese dishes are decent in general, but the Viet and Thai dishes are mostly dissapointing.

So, to end this indecisive reviews, here are my reccomendations on what to order:
Singaporean Vermicelli (is this a Chinese dish? I beg to differ), egg drop soup, congees, fried rice, tofu and vegetable hotpot,.. and.. that's all I can think of! Also, try to go for lunch, coz' it's cheaper and more worth it!-----------------------------------------
***THE GOOD***
-----------------------------------------
-The prices are fair and the delivery arrived ahead of schedule (with an asterisk - see the next section)

-The egg rolls are AMAZING. Next time I'm skipping the Crab Rangoon (see "The Ugly") and getting a double order of these delicious rolls!

-The Pad Thai was solid (maybe a poor choice of words) - I asked for medium spice and for a Midwesterner I'd say it's a pretty spicy medium but it's nice to challenge your taste buds! I could have used more chicken but overall was very pleased.

-General Tso's Chicken - really good flavor and texture. The portion was a bit small so I recommend getting some appetizers.

-----------------------------------------
***THE BAD***
-----------------------------------------
-As I mentioned, I ordered delivery and while the meal arrived ahead of time, it required reheating which makes me think it was sitting out on the counter for a while.

-By default, they don't include any soy or sour sauces in the bag (besides what comes standard with the appetizers) so make sure you have everything you need ahead of time!

-----------------------------------------
***THE UGLY***
-----------------------------------------
-My Crab Rangoon order was a complete joke. These were essentially just near-empty fried shells with about half a teaspoon of filling. Skip these and, like I say above, go for the double order of egg rolls. Seriously, these were so empty that I posted a photo of them to Instagram because I couldn't believe my eyes and needed the validation of social media to prove I wasn't missing something.

-The coupons on GrubHub that they offer are laughable. An order of $25 or more (excluding tax, delivery, and tip) get's a can of soda? $30 or more is the same thing but with bubble tea as an option? Please. The other Madison area Asian food restaurants offer much better coupons.Tried this place out with visiting family and the reviews were pretty much on the mark.  Nice atmosphere with an upscale feel--although the food was not quite up to the level of the surroundings.  Couldn't pinpoint anything bad per se, but there wasn't anything outstanding either.  But the staff was very friendly and great with my 16 month old daughter and 67 year old (and overly talkative) father.  Will probably go back, but it won't go on my top ten list.This Target has always been a bit awkward (even when it was, for a time, known as "Target Greatland"). The layout is different to any other location I've ever been in and I just find getting around difficult. 

Apart from that, the product selection is good and it's even got an extended grocery range. So, great stuff, but weird to get around.Strange to review a Target, but lately this store hasn't been as appealing. The layouts have become a little confusing. My friends and I have had trouble locating basic items such as tools, home supplies, and even kids' items. The placements often seem illogical, grocery area now included, as well.

I'm a shoe connoisseur, but sadly the last few pairs bought have been terrible. Sneakers wore out immediately, sandals broke at the toe after one week, and heels lost shape after one wearing causing nasty cuts all over my feet. While obviously I don't expect great quality from Target, a little higher end would be nice. 

Photo machines in-store are great, but online from home setup needs work. Very slow and unorganized.

Also, went in to pick up a few groceries last week for a big cabin trip. Found bags of potato chips on sale, but no French onion dip. Finally asked an employee who informed me they no longer carry it. Seriously?!? Chips but no dip?

Kohl's and Hy vee are seeing more business from me now. Sorry, Target, we had a good run.Only Negative event that happened to me:  I booked my hotel as my coworker stayed here for training.  I was able to RSVP my ride from the airport to the hotel.  Once I landed in Wisconsin I was waiting for the shuttle to come get me.  Well, it was 15 mins after so I decided to call my hotel.  Supposedly they tried calling me to tell me the shuttle was full and that I can either wait 40 mins or take a taxi in which they will pay for.  Well, obviously I am not able to answer my phone since its off during the flight nor did I get a voicemail.  Anyways, the hotel did pay for my taxi.  

Hotel is decent.  You get what you paid for.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel provides breakfast which is your usual bagels, bread, oatmeal, boiled egg etc, They also offer free drink cards during happy hour during the week and have free pizza for their guests during happy hour.  My hotel room was clean.  I did have an issue in trying to get the right temp in the room as I was either freezing or very hot but finally got it down LOL.  They do have a fitness center which is really small but hey I am not complaining.

I was able to place a reservation through the hotel's shuttle for a ride to the Cheese store.  Its an awesome perk that the shuttle will take you to a local business thats within a certain mile but you have to reserve your spot.  I did enjoy my stay here.We were in Madison for a collegiate lacrosse tournament and simply needed a comfortable and inexpensive place to sleep. We took advantage of a Hotwire Secret Deal that booked us at the Baymont Inn and Suites. The hotel was located just off the highway on a quiet side street. The staff were both friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable for the price - it was clean;  it had a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker; and the bed was comfortable - just what we needed for this short stay. After we had dinner, we returned to the hotel and enjoyed a cocktail in the lounge with a basket of complimentary popcorn. For this or a similar circumstance, I would stay here again. It is a good value.Well, by far better than S and K Menswear which is now out of business and for good reason.
I bought a suit hear and received some good service.   Tailor was on hand and did a good job sizing me and getting the job done in a timely manner.   
I got a feeling after my purchase that they didn't want to spend much more time with me.   Sort of like, thanks for your purchase now don't waste any more of my time.
I plan to try another men's store for my next purchase but I may go back here sometime too.  I just needed them to be more engaged in my life and clothing needs for me to make them "my clothier".Check out the Stable Grill for some classic Wisconsin cooking.  Excellent beer selection and filling dinners.  All in what's basically a fancied-up barn.  And unless she's chatting about her 4H days, probably not a great date place.

The fish fry is really outstanding. Skip the fries and get the parmesan potatoes. However, any other day of the week, the food, while good, is forgettable.The Stone House - pricey and slower paced.
The Stable Grill - more sandwichy

Sorry to say the place has slipped....another victim of popularity.
But I've come here for the ambience, the history, the property itself, the buildings themselves.  The ability I have to steep myself in the history.
I even like looking at the stones.  (see website pics)

As to the food....unfortunately, slipped in quality along with the service.  It's still good but price/value at the Stone House is definitely down while the Stable Grill is more, well ---- stable.

Never been to the parties - the fish frys, barbeques, or picnics and the like - so no comment on those. 

The bottom line is OK, if pricey, food in a wonderful environment.   If you're looking for fabulous food, not here.  If you enjoy the environment at least as much as the food you want, order the basics to be safe.This is my favorite place to come for fish fry (fish and chips to anyone outside of the Midwest).  There's not one thing I dislike about this dish here.  Perfectly battered cod with a crispy outside and moist flaky center, perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a great tarter sauce (so often overlooked).  It is all you can eat which includes both the fries and the cod.  There's no reason you should leave this place hungry.   One plate is usually enough anyways. 

If you like the Friday fish fry but want to avoid the crowd I would suggest visiting Quivey's on a Wednesday.  They offer the same all you can eat special for both lunch and dinner but without the hour and a half wait.  

So about the service.  The last few times I've been here the service has been great.   Unfortunately this hasn't always been the case, and I've known others that have had a similar experience.  I hope things have turned around.  I really enjoy dinning here and for a time the food was the only thing I found exceptional.Big portions for modest prices. I usually get it to go. Think of it as a better Taco Bell and you'll dig this place.

Fajitas dinner combo had 8 tortillas and a very generous helping of rice and beans, easy to split between multiple meals.

Half of their huge burritos could easily compare to a modest chipotle burrito.This review pertains to the Fitchburg location, the only one I use.  I've been a member here since late 2005.  In that time it's had a number of updates.  I am generally happy with the gym side of the club - still a member.  My biggest complaint is how you are basically forced to join a swim class if you want to use the pool in the morning.  I used to swim in the morning a lot, there was a regular group of us.  Once the Master's Swim program started, they use all of the lanes - even though technically "one is reserved", the reality is, it isn't.  So, if you want to swim in the morning, you are stuck in a lane with a bunch of very experienced competitive swimmers and are constantly getting in their way.  Now, I hardly ever swim.  That was the whole reason I joined, and they knew it.  I told them that.  They were totally unconcerned with members who used the pool for fitness swimming.

On the gym side, they've added new equipment, last year they did some new paint and remodeling, expanded the locker rooms.

Frankly, I am only still a member because I have a really good contract rate.  I can use equipment and the regular "gym" sorts of things for a hell of a lot less $$ at anytime fitness or similar.  I only keep my membership so I can use the pool, on those rare occasions I can skip out of work in the middle of the day when the pool is open.Not pricey at all, quality of food is above average while the service seldom sucks! Need more servers and apparently they are sometimes just too busy to take care of everyone.Here's the 411 on Happy Wok West- Consistently good food and excellent value. My location of choice, if you will, is Happy Wok Southtowne, as I have been going there for 6 years. That location is simply more charming, and the couple who owns it are especially nice. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with this location, although the more I frequent this one, the more I realize that their customer service here is somewhat hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a pleasant young man, other times a surly young lady who clearly doesn't know how to smile or greet people at work. Happy Wok, take notes. Put the aces in their places! 

The SouthTown location is an excellent choice for vegetarians, and anyone else with a dietary concern, as they will make it however you ask. This Wok, however, is not very helpful in that department. All the order takers here act annoyed when requests are made, and only sometimes do they follow thru, so do not be afraid to be very, very clear!  

This location has a drive thru, which is a novelty, and, well, awesome. All in all, this is a solid location with a reputation for fresh food and good prices. They are consistently 3 stars behind the SouthTowne Happy Wok in customer service(which gets 5 stars), however, and, as much as I like this location, I have to recommend they be stricter with some of their workers. Only the friendly ones should be up front! Not smiling? Put 'em out of sight, guys!They do a good job here but they changed their burger recipe.   The Steakhouse burger was excellent.  No longer served.  Then they went to a modified burger that was the XT I think.  It was ok but not as good.  Now they have a California burger or something like that and it is a little less appealing.   Not our thing anymore.
The fries are usually very good and very hot.Yummy Chips and Salsa! If your up for something new try a MALIBU MELON MARGARITA, only made at Pedro's, It's delicious!20 minutes late with an order I put in almost 2 hours ago.  Staff are very nice and gave me a coupon for $5 off next visit.  This is a common problem with them, so you need to pad whatever time they tell you by 20-30 min.  If you need pizza in a hurry for guests, better off with Pizza Hut or other chainNothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona.We drove down from Red Wing MN, for a dinner at one of Wisconsin's traditional Steak Houses.
It was on Thursday and it was busy around 5:45pm which was surprising, for such a small town.
Sullivan's does not rate a 4.5. Star based on our experience but it is worth a visit, for the experience.
It's a nice location, bustling with activity.. A very nice traditional salad bar, but come on the garlic toast.. Is dry, flavorless and dry..!
I had the Walleye , pan fried, two nice filets, 4/5 ounces each, and a little over cooked, but not bad, a 3.5... My guest had the battered shrimp and they looked good but were very greasy, and tasteless 2.0...!
The Gin and tonics were watered down with a pour quality Tonic on a gun.. Instead of a quality tonic like  Schweppes , or Q...! 2.0
The service was fine, the Resturant clean, and the view of the river nice, they did ask us to wait and they would have a window table, a nice touch..! Service 4.0..!
It's worth a trip, but it's not something I would recommend as a dining destination..Recently stayed at this resort for a staycation and have to say it was a very comfortable stay. Rooms are nice and clean, staff is all very friendly and helpful and the beds are very comfortable. The resort is well kept and the pool area is nice. 

For the price per night, the resort should at the very least offer a FREE continental breakfast in the morning. We were told that we could not bring in any food or drink into the pool area as long as the restaurant/bar area is open for business. And it is open for business until about 8pm. The resort also charges an EXTRA $20 per night fee for internet, computer and gym use and it is NOT optional!! I think you should be able to opt out of this fee and you cant!

Also didn't like that the parking lot was SOOO far away from the resort. For elderly people or for anyone in the summer this can be killer walking to and from your car.

Overall the stay was great but just expected more for the amount of money you spend to stay here.This property is quite lovely and the service all around was very nice. Friendly in the lobby, friendly in the restaurant, nice pool, great view of the Arizona desert, and the rooms were adequate. I mean they were a bit warm as was the lobby. That might be from opening and closing the doors all day in the sunshine, I don't know. Your server in the downstairs bar leaves a bit to be desired - very unfriendly. We're locals and can come and go anywhere in the valley and be treated a bit better. I'd definitely return for the food though.Live music in the lobby bar echos throughout the check-in area and you feel peaceful the second you drive up to the front doors. The hotel is really pretty in a Native Arizona style and rich with culture and history. 

We loved the pool, breakfast outdoors overlooking the pool and golf course, the golf was great, and the live music in the lobby was awesome. Night time you can see the stars and the fire-pits are lit outside providing that chill escape. You'd never know except for having seen it in your drive in that you're 8 minutes from the casino and outlet mall. you feel secluded and relaxed away from the hustle and bustle. 

Negatives:
Don't Order Room Service if You actually want to eat what you order:
We arrived late on a Thursday night- 10 PM- with just enough time to check-in, grab a beer, and go down to the hot-tub before the pool area shut down. We stopped by the bar after relaxing in the hot-tub and grabbed another round of drinks and tried to order food- bar kitchen was closed- which seemed fair since it was now almost 11 PM. So we ordered room service to our room. They told us on the phone  it would be 40 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later- no food. We finally gave up and went to sleep. In the morning we visited the front desk to voice our grievances and they showed no record of the room service order. So had we stayed up waiting we never would have gotten food. 

Our room:
We were given an SPG preferred guest room. We are platinum SPG  guests- but we did book a pre-paid lowest guaranteed rate (so maybe that's why the cruddy room)- we were placed in a preferred guest room - but it had no view- just a massive tree blocking the golf course and desert we so desired to see. It did have a balcony. It was TINY and it had no robes, even though we had requested them. 

Check-out:
Having worked in a hotel, I am a firm believer in using hotel services, like bellmen and tipping them well. I called in advance and I also notified a bellman in person that I needed help with our bags since my husband was on the golf course and we needed to get checked-out of our room by check-out time. I gave a specific time I needed help and twenty minutes notice. No one showed up- I had to call twice. I finally grabbed all four of our bags and started hauling them down the hallway -when I saw a bellman headed in the direction of our room. He apologized (and was very kind) and gave me a hand. Just annoying when you hear bellmen venting about people handling their own bags yet when you ask for help it takes over an hour to get someone to your door. 


Loved the actual hotel and location just wish a few things had gone smoother and a better room location. Super nice staff- except for the coffee girl at the cafe in the morning. Her "give-a-hoot" meter was at a zero. 

I want to give it another try.Nothing's of much grandeur in the aviation industry anymore. Anyone who doesn't purchase a first class seat might as well expect abysmal service, why let yourself be surprised? 

First of all, US Airways isn't ACTUALLY operating "US Airways" style. They're owned and operated by America West, which has always been notorious for nickeling and diming their passengers. Pre-merger, this used to be a somewhat respectable airline. However, as business progressed, America West has inflicted US Air and it's subsidies with "America West Business" - overcharging for everything but the seats. (But there's an exception to even that rule...) America West clearly had no idea of the sheer size of the combined new airline they had created. Flights have been continually late, cancelled, and overbooked. Planes are rapidly aging. On US Air Express Jets the America West logo is still quite intact. A lack of business has caused US Air to pull out of hundreds of gates, making airports ghost towns. So don't blame US Air, blame America West. 

Anyway...I've flown both America West & US Air a fair amount. US Air internationally isn't nearly as painful as a domestic flight. Since it's neck  and neck with Southwest, their standards have been mainly homogenized. Except US AIR CHARGES 60 DOLLARS TO CHECK TWO BAGS! Are you kidding me?! No wonder you're going out of business! Southwest cares about it's customers, even if it does pack them in like cattle. As soon as US Air takes the money out of your pocket, the service you paid for is up for grabs- there's no guarantee whether you'll get it or not. Though US Air does offer assigned seating and I do like that a lot. I can't say I'm fond of rushing to the plane to get the best possible seat. 

Flew US Air last night for the hundredth time. Had to fight myself to not buy Almonds...but at $3 they probably weren't worth it. Flight attendants were both friendly and positive. Definitely raised my morale throughout the flight. Flight was a few minutes early, so that was a plus. Things generally run pretty smoothly, at least out of Phoenix anyway. They're definitely doing something right out of Sky Harbor. So I'm not going to complain. It's an airline, they're all the same more or less. It usually gets you where you need to go, and you're not paying $400-$500 dollars like you would on Northwest or United. Take the good with the bad. If you absolutely can't stand lousy service and expensive fees, or you're just looking to get from A to B, there's always another airline to choose from.I like US Airways because they simply fly where I go.I still have a hard time accepting the $25 baggage fee and paying for snacks on my flight.  I just assum that when I spend over $300 for a ticket that would include AT LEAST a free bag of pretzels.  Not the case.

I do appreciate the flight from Phoenix to DCA running on time.  The agents at the gate were also pleasant and called each customer by his name when scanning the boarding ticket.  Customer service at it's finest.US Air has gone downhill fast over the past few years. I use to be a frequent flyer and had "status" with them due to work travel. The past year or so I have not been traveling as much and they act like I was never that frequent customer. To me, that does not deserve my business. I'd rather fly on an airline that appreciates all customers, from first class to the back of the plane, and takes the time to present a clean, modernized travel experience.The hubs and I went here on Sunday. 

The wait looked like it was going to be an hour with all the people standing outside, but it was only 10 minutes! Score! 

We were seated and our server was with us quickly. 

I went to breakfast wanting a waffle. This is a BREAKFAST place that DOES NOT serve waffles......W.T.F. Seriously people. Almost ruined my breakfast. 

So I directed my attention to the pancakes. I got 2 cakes with coconut and glazed pecans mixed in the batter, wayyy tasty. I also got a side of eggs with cheese and turkey sausage. I was so not a fan of the sausage, it had a consistency that creeped me out and there were mysterious hard grizzly bits in it. totally turned me off of turkey breakfast meat products. 

All in all its a decent spot, the prices are fair and you get a lot of food.I don't go here often, but the few times I've gone are pretty good. Nothing out of the ordinary, but good breakfast/brunch food. Huge menu, decent prices.Phew, this place is expensive.  Also, I don't understand why a 2 Queen bed is cheaper than 1 Queen or King bed room?  

When we arrived, the garage for this hotel's parking had a sign for being "temporarily full" so we valeted our entire stay (just the weekend) for twice as much.  Gah.  

The lobby had the most amazing decor and our room was beautiful (but had thin walls) with a decent view of downtown.  The hotel was in close proximity to restaurants, the US Air Center, Chase Field, public transportation, the Symphony Hall, the Convention Center...so location-wise, it's great.

We had a mishap at the jacuzzi in the form of about 10 little kids and their parents with the kids going crazy jumping back and forth between the jacuzzi and the pool.  To add to that, the jacuzzi wasn't even that warm.

That isn't to say that this isn't a great hotel, they have a computer dedicated to printing out your boarding passes so that is helpful if you came without a computer.  (Which we deliberately did because of their crazy internet charges...we also used my boyfriend's smart phone to get around that).  If you need a rental car, they have an Enterprise IN the hotel, but you have to book early (we learned that the hard way).

Would stay there again :)  If not just to get points for your frequent flier miles program (don't forget to do that if you can!)almost everything was as you'd expect in a Hyatt... 

2 funny things... 

the rotating restaurant on top... it has a good wine list... the "house" wine was Robert Mondavi Chardonnay and Cabernet... nothing bad about that... but when the waitress says "oh... our house wine is from Napa, CA... it's really good" you expect more than good table wine...

the maid came in the room at 6am to clean, realized we were in there (maybe she was thinking it was another room or something) and then left... that's not ideal, but ok... but then she left the light on! Had to get up and turn it off!!! WTF?

Otherwise, good amenities, super convenient downtown

but

They nickle and dime you for everything... 

have to pay for internet, no fridge... 

but the people are nice...We went on a stay-cation and enjoyed the amenities and mostly the location of this Hyatt. The Compass spinning restaurant is definitely a place to have a celebratory dinner, or if you're a Hyatt guest do the 9pm - 11pm(?) happy hour drinks and spin around in a venue that was once a Playboy Club. See the San Carlos one minute, and the stadium views the next. Drinks are fun, but the nostalgia, effects and sophisticated nature make Compass a place to check out.

We had to pay for WiFI. On the upside their gym was really state of the art (although the pool was closed- but we were offered the Sheraton pool instead; I think Hyatt is nicer after looking at their property). 

The gym had machines w/ computers that had games like Solitare and overall really new equipment and nice amenities for a gym. Although, before I hit the gym there I did my cardio around the hotel at the Cityscape running up and down the stairs.

Good place to stay if you need somewhere Downtown. Ask about the pool. Check out the Compass restaurant. Watch the ground as you take the elevator upstairs on the side that overlooks the city.

Go to Copper Blues for dinner and live music, and Bar Smith after for dance and drinks.What a surprise! My students wanted to go here for lunch while at the AZ SkillUSA Championship. Imagine my delight when I discovered how good the food was. We were served by the owner, too.Great place for Happy Hour,  specially for the downtown folks.  The bartender are not frugal with the spirits when it comes to mix drink if you know what i mean.

For Lunch time, I recommend the Shepard's Pie or the Fish and Chips and stay away from the Mushrooms for some reason their chef's cannot Fry this bad boys properly.I was totally expecting to add another star to my review after participating in the Seamus/Turf festivities for St. Paddy's day.  Definitely not the case.  I couldn't have been more pissed off.

The husband and I went to the Turf around 5 to grab something to eat.  After paying a stupid 10 dollar cover charge, which included both places, we though McAffrey's would be a better choice since they block off the street every year for the party.  That did not happen this year.  The pub became more crowded than ever and we couldn't even get in.  What a waste.  I was really disappointed.  Between the Turf and McAffrey's and 40 bucks later, we only got a couple small plates of food.  BOO!I've only been here once. Took a date here. Heard good things from others but I wasn't too impressed. It a dive. Which is okay but i was expecting a bit more. 
So putting it in the "dive" category, drinks are cheap, food was good. But the service could have been better. 
I wouldn't make the drive from my side of town one a regular basis but I'd definitely try it again if i happen to be downtown for a game or something.Not a bad spot, open late and had good beer available.Tucked away behind historic buildings and located a couple hundred feet from the sight of the original Phoenix China town stands a local restaurant that has been part of the city since the 1920s. For that reason, I think everyone should try this place at least once. 

The place was hopin' on a Saturday afternoon when I was there. The windowless building is a little cave like, with harsh soft light hanging from the ceiling. It resembled most Americanized Chinese food places: Asian art on the wall, old booths, plastic table cloths. 

I don't agree with some of other Yelp reviews that the food was so bad. It was pretty average. I like lemon chicken and get that pretty much anywhere I go, so I tried it here. I wasn't blown away, but it wasn't terrible. The fried rice left the same impression. 

But they were friendly to me and kept my glass of water full. 

I want to go back and try the name sake Chop Suey. Maybe that's where they excel. Any place that can survive in downtown Phoenix for this many decades deserves some respect.Kinda a weird place inside ... very open which gave me feeling I was eating in a fish bowl ... food was okayThey used to offer half price bottles of wine, however it is now half off your first bottle and full price on the rest. I was sorry to see that special go.

Nicole is a genuinely nice person and an amazing pianist. Request the classics or Top 40. She knows them all. And you can actually chat with her as she plays. The staff is usually fun, beautiful, young and professional.

I recommend the Caprese Salad (watch out for the whole garlic cloves) or the Cheese Plate and a table full of your best friends. Skip the Cosmos and share a bottle of the Crios Syrah. Save room for dessert.I come here often and get one dish, so my review is a bit limited.  
Udon Chicken Noodle soup. 
I love it.  
Now here is an example of how I am easy to please, I think...cause a coworker told me about Udon soup they had in California, and it made what I eat here sound like high school culinary class food.  But, I still like Yasda's.  
The broth, the chicken, and the noodles are all very very tasty to me.  There is a little fried tempura piece of...uhm...something on top, which I personally like how it gets all soggy for me to eat with the soup.  And they give you a side of white rice to soak everything up if you'd like - and its a nice amount of rice.
Nothing special.  At all.  But it does me good on the colder days at lunch.  
And I like the service.  First time I came here, I didn't have cash for a drink.  The lady slid me a cup on the sly:)  There's two of them that usually work the counter and they are always very friendly.
Now, I will admit the layout inside is jacked up.  When it gets busy, the line wraps around a chunk of tables smack dab in the middle.  So you got people trying to eat while folks are hovering over them, talking and letting drops of saliva fly out....ok, i'll stop.  Then there's a bunch of tables on the right side of the place too close together.  I like to sit at the table against the window to people watch, and deal with the least of the crowdiness.  The drink and condiment stations are too close together and its a dance-off trying to get your chili garlic while someone else is trying to get a coke. 
Also, their sushi options are so limited that they shouldn't even have it on the menu.

But...I dunno, I really like the place.  Its where I go when I can't decide, and when I'm having a downer of a day.  I'm going to try other dishes...eventually...maybe...probably not:)I enjoyed seeing the Cezanne collection. It's just like pictured in the book. I spent time reading about his works and his influence on composition and form. As in other museum I've visited, one really can't take pictures of their best display. It's really a place to walk around for a couple of hours when one doesn't feel rush.

I wanted to be surprise to see Classical sculptures and hand made works of art and I didn't see any here as,  I'm very particular about the historical eras and movement of interest . Leave that to the big city museums. The fact that they have high end borrowed art and a place like this in Phoenix makes it a must for resident to see once in a while what the civic offering provides. This place is half a block off the light rail makes it convenient.We didn't have a great visit but maybe the problem is that I brought 3 children with me to experience the art?The gym is fairly clean, however it is pretty small and they didn't really have a large range of exercise equipment plus they only had one mat to stretch out on.Went there for dinner with some friends.  Rolled in about 530pm and we had the entire place to ourselves.  I had the rice ball since I had read a great review on it elsewhere.  I even called the day before since it wasn't listed on the menu, the owner was very kind and promised me he would save me one.  It wasn't the greatest I have ever had it was decent.  The rice was a bit too sticky, and I would have enjoyed it more if there was more meat in the middle.  My friend ordered Panino which seemed to be very fresh.  The mozzarella was marinated and delicious.  Overall I think I would try this place again perhaps for lunch.  The owner was great  and very catering to us while we were there.Lo-Lo's is still at a solid 3 for me. I love the chicken and since my last review I have been back for to go orders several times. The service is fast and very friendly. I have since tried several different side Items, almost all of them I think.

My top sides are;

Buttered Corn outstanding 5 stars
Greens best I have had outside the house solid 5 stars
Mac and Cheese between a 4 and 5 just because some days it's on point and others it's just aight. 
Smothered potatoes 4 stars
Candied yams 4 stars
Rice and gravy 2 stars the gravy was disappointing had bell pepper in it.
My least favorite Red beans and rice 1 star, I love red beans and rice but not with BBQ sauce yuck. 

I had a little problem with the desert. I love Red velvet cake but theirs is disappointing. I went on Saturday and saw that delicious mountain of a cake in the window and knew I had to have a slice. I got it home it tasted like cornbread?! WTF Someone messed up and made it wrong. I called they offered me another the next day but that one wasn't much better. The sock it to me cake was very sweet. 

My standing order will be Chicken, mac n cheese and greens from now on! I have yet to try a waffle since I have been getting to go orders I don't know how well a waffle will travel. I like the initial crispness to my waffles. I will be back to dine in one day and I will get a waffle. 

BTW the sweet tea is SWEEEEEEET!I have been going to gyms for a long time.. but i rarely like them.  I do like 24hr. They have everything I want for the most part.  I like it more because I know when to go so it is not crowded.

They have fair pricing, and no contract and I can go to anyone in the valley which works because I am all over the valley often. So I think it is pretty good.  The staff is cool too.  

I don't like the fact that they don't have a punching bag.  Sometimes I just want to beat on the bag and you can't do that with the ones I have been to.  The TV's need to be upgraded also.

But overall it is a good experience.Meh. As the name states, the  "wine bar" is definitely secondary here.   My husband and I stopped in for a few drinks at the bar and it was completely dead on a Saturday night.  (Perhaps after work its more hopping?)  The wine selection was lacking, with only a handful of whites available by the glass.   

The atmosphere is very nice but its still laid back.  You can roll up in here in your baseball hat, windbreaker, and sneakers if you want to.

We ordered the calamari to snack on and it was so incredibly salty.  Like REALLY salty.  I didn't care for the sauce they served with it and it was overly cripsy.  (And at one point I bit into something hard and shell like which makes no sense whatsoever.) 

I would love to go back and try dinner (and if I do I will update my review) but I would definitely not order any seafood based upon our bad calamari experience.Note: I've never sat down and had a proper dinner at Portland's, it's all about the bar for me. So take this into consideration when reading this review. :)

The boy and I visited Portland's Friday evening after not having been in nearly a year. We used to frequent the bar for the great beer list and the amazing BBQ Chicken pizza and fries, so we were a bit disappointed to see that things have changed.

Gone was the list of quirky, hard to find microbrews. Instead, Heineken, Pacifico, and Stella Artois graced the list. There were a few good ones- notably the sweet and strong (8%) Sri Lankan Lion Stout- but all in all, much more pedestrian than it used to be.

Another disappointment set in when we realized the BBQ Chicken pizza was no longer on the menu. No worries though- the Pepe Rosso  pizza was delicious. With herbed ricotta, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and basil, it was much better than I thought it was going to be. Score!

Even with the good beer and great pizza, the highlight of the evening had to be the parmesan fries. These alone make the trip down here worth it. I don't know what they do to them, other than parmesan and parsley, but they are divine.ok we are going to play "it's a small world" - Phoenix Yelp edition. ready? ok lets go.

i live 100 feet from Portlands around the corner twice, i've had drinks here a few times, pricey but not bank breaking. they have a DJ who plays music here. this DJ's name...well fuck his name. but i'll quote a review on Yelp, Barrio Cafe, from Max A., "I wasn't impressed with the guac - so what if some emo guy with horn rimmed glasses stabs at some avocados and other diced veggies with a spoon for 30 seconds?" http://www.yelp.com/biz/barrio-cafe-phoenix

lol Yup, that the same "Emo guy". haha. before working at Barrio' he worked at portlands. he's a cool guy, not really Emo. i know  his Mother well, she owns The Root, http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-root-phoenix.  which is where i get my hair cut. 

yea it's a small world.  

so back to portlands. atmosphere is nice upscale bar, resturant. outside patio available. the bar is circular and you sit around it like attacking indians surrounding the wagons in a western flick. its interesting. nothing outstanding. i haven't dared the food yet. and might not. i've lived here a few years and have not tempted this place more then a few times. so what's the point starting now.

 oh and if your a married guy living off 7th ave and Georgia, i know your secrets. {wink,  wink} my silence will cost ya bud.This place isn't awesome; but it isn't bad, either.

I've eaten dinner here a couple of times when in Phoenix for work.  Both times I've parked myself at the bar, so I can't really speak for the table area.  But the circular bar area is comfortable, not too loud, and it's usually easy to find some good conversation (mainly because there are apartments above the restaurant).

I had the filet w/ au gratin potatoes, and was pleased.  Add the $3 beer special and you've got a solid meal.

It doesn't seem too pretentious, and the service for me was good (again, since I was at the bar both times, my experience is based on the bartender).  There are a lot of varied reviews on Portland's, but in my opinion it's worth a shot if you're nearby and want something comfortable.One night after #FightClub, the lovely Georgie S and I hit up Portland's for their Twitter special. I was excited to try the food here, as I had only partaken in some adult bevies on my only other trip. 

We decided to sit at the bar because we didn't want to give people the impression we were on a real date. Georgie kept referring to me as her faux-date and a poor one at that, as I kept talking about my current dating situation. The ambiance and decor of Portland's is nice and cozy and I really like the circular bar. I haven't been on the full on restaurant side yet, but it looked nice as well. The bartender who took care of us was prompt and attentive. She offered some suggestions as well. 

We started our meal with the Tempura Rock Shrimp. When they arrived it was a little underwhelming. They really weren't tempura fried. More like regular fried fried. The dipping sauce was OK, but didn't help too much. We both got the Twitter special of a Steak salad, vegetarian diet be damned. The bartender even suggested adding shredded Mozzarella to the salad, which we did. The salads came out and for $5 it was amply sized. The steak was tasty and tender; paired with the tomato vinaigrette, it was A-OK. 

Overall, it was an OK dining experience. Portland's is located right next to a light rail stop and there is street parking so it is not tough to get to. I could see Portland's getting bumped up a star in the future. I will have to come back and sample some more.Went here tonight, a First Friday evening around 8pm. Only 3 other tables were full and about 12 people in the bar. The waiter was a little slow and didn't ask to refill or anything till we were done eating...unusual. After the $6 asparagus wrapped in purscissto and a burger with white cheese, tomato, lettuce and pickle for $15..it wasn't anything special or even amazing flavor difference. I don't think ill be back unless they make something more mouth-watering, sorry! Although I do support their organic concept, a star for that! I just felt like we were not welcomed and payed too much for bland flavored food.I have been going to Pullanos since they opened.  Still the best pizza but the wings have gone down hill over the years.  Now it just tastes like a wing drowning in Tabasco.  Not the flavor it used to have.  Also, the wings are so much smaller than they used to be.Not the greatest but they always have great deals... Hard to resist! Usually a great crowd too!Nothing fancy about this place, it's your typical Denny's restaurants.  It's open 24 hours a day, so it's good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  You can order breakfast food during night time and dinner during day time.  They don't care what time it is, they will fill you up anyway they can get.  Also, they offer free birthday meal, just show up and let them know it's your birthday and they'll pay for your meal, easy like that.The music on Tuesdays is....interesting. The bathrooms are disgusting and the the bartenders aren't what you would expect. But give it a chance, good people frequent and the beer specials are on point.When we pulled up I almost made my husband turn around & take me somewhere else...it looked crazy sketchy.  We went & ordered at the window & sat outside (only seating there is) our food came out very quickly. I ordered a chicken chimichanga with green sauce, it was full of onions & the green sauce was just salsa, I was expecting some kind of chile sauce.  As I got to the middle of the chimi, it was very cold on the inside, as in, not cooked. Weird. The beans & rice were SO good, though! My husband wants to come back & try something else, I'm not too sure yet how I feel about it.I went with a huge group, and since there was only one waitress there (they had to call another waiter to come in to help), the service was not great.  One group got their food, and when they were almost finished eating, our orders were taken.  They had burgers and fries on their menu which I thought was weird, under "Gringo Food."

I got their chicken picado, pretty good, sauteed chicken with onions and peppers, with rice and beans and a good, large flour tortilla.  Their chips and salsa were OK, pureed tomatoes, very spicy in little bottles.  I ate so much of them because my food came out so late.  The chairs were hard, it was a really large, empty restaurant with a somewhat bar-ish feel.

Good to stop by if you're in the area but not worth a long trip.We were in the Phoenix area a few weekends ago and after we saw that Los Reyes de la Tortas was overflowing, I did a quick yelp search and saw that I had bookmarked OHW and we headed on over. The place has a huge dining room and a bar and patio off the back. 

They were out of zucchini when we were there (huge sad face), but my friend and I each got a burger and some fries. They were pretty good, but they weren't the best burgers I've ever had in my life. I'd probably try it again if I was in the area, but I'm sure there are better burger places aroundIf you like to eat and you're not a vegetarian, you've likely heard of The Original Hamburger Works. It may even be on the list of eateries that you "must visit when in Phoenix" depending on who you ask.

You order your meal at a tiny window next to the grill where the burgers are cooked. Flames leap from the cooking surface as you speak your order to the...order taker? I don't know what to call her, because you don't pay here, you only order here. You walk around the corner and pay for your food.

I didn't order the gigantic burger, I opted for the big burger. With fries and a drink. I paid about $9 for it and I was told to listen for my name while I got my drink from the digital Coke machine.

About ten minutes later, I hear my name and retrieve my food. There's a toppings bar with condiments to apply to your sammich. After one bite of this big burger, it's clear that it deserves steak sauce, grilled onions and salt and pepper and not the usual condiments and toppings. The beef is tasty and delicious and I am doing it wrong with lettuce, tomato, onions, Cholula and mayo. Without the bun and with a knife and fork, it'd fit right in as a "chopt steak" at most steakhouses. 

The fries were not remarkable, but they were adequate sidekicks for the hamburger. 

The part of town that the restaurant inhabits is a little bit run down. The parking available is suspect at best- the small strip mall on the corner has narrow spaces and on-street parking is limited. The clientele is a mix of tourists, neighborhood denizens and locals trying to grab a bite to eat.

Try it on a Saturday after 1pm for ease of enjoyment.the wait was long, but that means the food was cooked fresh.  it was not bad.  a decent burrito.  something cheesy, greasy and hot was also ordered.  decent food, service was okay.This place is okay as far as this sort of thing goes.  I had an aunt interred here from 1960 to 2009 when they had her remains moved to the Chandler Cemetery to be next to her husband, my uncle.  When she passed away from asthma and cancer the Chandler Cemetery hadn't been formed yet.  Here, she was in a "vault" I think they call it.  They were stacked about 4-6 high along a wall.  I like where she is now better, near my uncle and cousin.  The actual grounds, outside the mausoleum, are green and lush.I have to start this review by saying I am a fan of hampton inns.  Clean rooms, free breakfast, free wifi, and a decent price is usually the norm.

Lately, I have had been bumping into the older variety and while the amenities are the same, they dont feel like they are worth the even low price.  

This is one of those older hampton inns.  It was all in all just average.  The rooms were clean and had all the amenities, but they just looked liked they really needed updating/renovating.  

The breakfast was the standard make your waffles, bagels, etc so no complains and the service was nice.

I did not try the pool, but found the gym to be small and usable except for the fact that the one elliptical machine was broken (bummer).

Would I recommend this location? Yes for convenience to the hospital and that is about it.Well it's a mid-level hotel/motel.  Way better than your average Best Western and they do clean your comforter and sheets before you arrive and every 4th day afterward, so that's good.  My room kind of overly smelled like cleaner solutions on the first night, but that went away after I'd had a couple of mixed drinks (that I had to bring in myself because there is seriously no bars within walking distance that I could find online...  But there is a Walgreens about a block away, so that situation worked itself out...

The staff was very nice and the continental breakfast was edible.

The cleaning staff likes to leave the shower curtains on the outside of the tub, so when you take a shower and don't pay attention, all the excess shower water will pool up on the bathroom floor.

Free WiFi across the entire building and the pool was a massive plus, and the brewed coffee in the morning was actually quite good even if they use mini moos creamers...  Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but I did enjoy staying here.  I'd come again...Mixed feelings:  their selection of jewelry, both small and large gauge, as well as necklaces, etc. is amazing and gorgeous, and actually reasonably priced.  For those like me who appreciate one-of-a-kind, ethnic jewelry, it's Phoenix's best.

However:

The attitude really turns me off.  The whole over-the-top sterility shit really irritates me.  I mean, putting gloves on to remove jewelry from the glass case?  Hi, it's not sterile - who the hell cares?  And I would hope that jewelry is physically cleaned before anyone actually puts it into their body, making the glove show moot.

Also, they refused to pierce my nostril and immediately place the tiny stud I wanted, saying I would have to heal around the ginormous stud for x amount of time until I could switch.  There was not a reasonable discussion behind the statement, it was more like a parent telling a child "Because I said so".  Knowledge is power, people, and doing a little non-condescending explaining wouldn't hurt.  And yes, I understand why you don't put a tiny stud in a fresh nostril - for fear of swelling and possible engulfment of the stud.  I'm a physician and can manage any issues myself had they arose - but the staff wouldn't even discuss it.  

Kindness and respect goes a long way, and if I don't feel like those virtues are offered by my tattooist or piercer, I don't use their services.  End of story.I have not gotten a piercing done (yet?). If I do decide to put a hole in my body I'll definitely be coming back here with questions 1st, especially about price. Did 1 reviewer really have to pay $90 for both ear lobes to be pierced?!

I was in here on a Fri a little after 6pm. The friendly/funny guy behind the counter said Fri's could be semi busy. I'll keep that in mind if I ever come back. Don't come here thinking you can be in & out.

My first reaction walking in came from my nose. I couldn't help but blurt out, "Wow, now that's a smell." It smelled like major antiseptic. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It was just strong & a little unpleasant at first. I got used to it quickly.

To me, Halo is a mix between a:
1. Doctor/dentist office because of the smells.
2. Library because it can be so quiet it's almost uncomfortable at times.
3. Museum because of the glass cases of "jewelry".

There were 4 people sitting on the bench & 2 others on chairs almost in the hallway. I asked how long they'd been there. Only 2 people were having something done. 1 girl said she'd been helped but had been there for about an hour. If you've been helped then why do you still have to sit there?!

I know Halo has rave reviews, to say the least but the prices I've heard about & the whole waiting thing I encountered makes me pause before jumping on the band wagon (again, yet). I'm going to do my research on other places & then see how I feel.Char's is a classic dive but I like it and keep coming back. It always has good live bands and enthusiastic crowds. It is one of the best places to listen to funky R&B. On the downside, they seem to have the same 3 or 4 bands play there, and there is very little variety of music styles. Char's music has become very predictable, although quality is not an issue. 

It's one of the few place in the Valley where you can dance to live music every day of the week until 1 am!

Service is friendly and fairly fast considering how crowded the place can get.

The patrons are a diverse crowd in terms of race but are probably mostly over the age of 35. Lots of interracial dancing which I find to be one of the coolest things about Char's. 

So, now for the negatives:

Their blown out sound system needed to be upgraded a decade ago. 

The dance floor is heavily worn and is far too small for anything but stationary hip grinding (except the rare occasions when there are only one or two couples on the floor). There is no stage for the bands so they often overflow onto the small dance floor. 

There are too few choices of draft beer, although what they have is good. 

Bathrooms are fairly disgusting. 

Parking is problematic. 

Char's should have been out of business years ago but they have become a tradition.Don't know why I stopped here! I was looking for something to eat, noticed the establishment, and a burger sounded good. So I pull up to order and once again, like I always do! I ordered something that I didn't stop here for!! So I ended up ordering their chili cheese fries w/onion. 
Service:
There were no one else in the drive through, all I ordered was the chili cheese fries. It took them over 15 min to get the order out! Don't know why, but this seems to be a long wait to me?
Food:
Well, let me put it this way for you! A) should have just driven by and continued to find something else. B) Should have ordered what I wanted in the first place!
Chili fires were to greasy and not enough flavors. I love my chili, but this could have passed as a chili sauce.
I'm not trying to say this is the worst place around, but I will have second thoughts of coming back here. And If I ever do? I will not try their chili fries again.Greasy, fresh, should make you feel better " buzzed food" to absorb all the alcohol. 
Similar to Federico's, filibertos, Ramiro's, Etc.... Fast and friendly and pretty decent.Charlies is great if you want cheap drinks and a place to dance. I can't tell you how many times I've ended up there because it's a Sunday or Tuesday or an equally useless day of the week and my dance partner and I just want a place to shake it. 

The biggest downside is the attitude toward women there. Fag hags and dykes are welcome, it seems. But young-ish, femme-ish lesbian couples might find themselves receiving some serious coldness. I stopped going to Charlies for months after an episode of outright hostility from the staff. Come on, guys! We're not trying to take over your bar. We just wanna dance and drink. We tip well. We're friendly. We're all family, right??

Eventually I ended up back at Charlies. It seems the employees responsible for most of the discrimination and attitude are not working there anymore. Thank goodness! Now I can get back to dancing my feet off!The trailer out front sells the best Mexican food in Phoenix.

Yeh, ok, I've typically just finished 17 Long Island Teas before stumbling over to their little window by the volleyball court to slur an order for street tacos. Still, that food is damn good. And the tacos are like 12-cents each! (Or whatever.)

Now I hate country music. So I usually only go on Sunday afternoons for beer bust and $1.50 Long Islands. And we only hang out on the patio to watch Tranny Volleyball. Who knew trannies were so good at volleyball?!Wasn't particularly impressed. But maybe that's because I am from SF. And SF burns out after awhile, but it sets a precedent for what a gay bar should be like.

But that doesn't go to say Charlie's doesn't have a specific spirit and charm that only could come in Phoenix.

Came here during my short jaunt to Phoenix, because whenever I visit a new city... I have a habit of needing to go to a gay bar and check out what's going on. It was a Sunday and the place was a little bit busy. Maybe it was for the Pussy LeHoot and Friends drag show.

Had a margarita, because it started with an Ultimate Margarita during dinner. Wanted to continue the trend and thought the drink was Arizona appropriate/approved. The bartenders were all dressed like cowboys, everywhere I went I saw a Jack or an Ennis... but sadly, none were Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhal.

Bummer.

Notes to consider:

1.) They don't allow purses. This could cause a damper for trannys or girls.
2.) One bartender charged me $4 for my margaritas, I went to another one because the one I went to before was busy and it became $5.
3.) It has a volleyball court. Something to consider if they ever do a dirty sports themed night.
4.) The drag show dragged on. No puns intended, but that was the best way to put it.
5.) Music was horrible. Inconsistent.
6.) The bar is massive, entertainment was dive-y... but Phoenix gays settle within their own. That is only if the except if they smell new meat...I am frightened for Dear old Mary Coyle.. while I love her ice cream ,  her shoppe is  getting way past  ye olde ice cream shoppe and heading for just old. Last night upon entering ,  I   dejavued to an old folks home , there is a strange smell in there that is creeping up on old person nasty. 
They  need a serious makeover and re freshen the whimsical nature that could be there. The ice cream parlor look needs up doing.. Could you imagine if they retro funked it up? How wonderful it could be.. think ice cream meets smeeks  meets willy wonka... ?  who do I call to make this happen?The ice cream was excellent! My hubby said it is one of the best ice cream he had! It was very creamy and rich, knowing they are home made. Not  many ice cream parlor still do this, usually it is commercial ice cream and they just  serve it, but Mary Coyle is different. 
The only thing that  is lack is the customer service, We asked for peanuts on the side, and they never came.  And my hubby did not want whipped cream on his and it came with it! So.... if you want to go for good ice cream,... this is the place, but for the customer service, be merciful ...:)Coming from So.Cal and the Williamsburg-like hood of San Diego I was homesick and eager to find a chill spot I could sip a couple cold ones and bob my head to some good music. I yelped one evening and stumbled upon H.H. I made the 20 min drive up there and was instantly excited because the DJ was playing a classic S.V. track. I went to the horseshoe shaped bar and a kind fellow put my $4.50 drink on his tab "Sky Ginger vodka on ice? Don't mind if I do" the best part was he didn't even hit on me just welcomed me to the "hood" and I damn near skipped over to my table that towers my 4'11 frame. 
I read from other reviews that the drinks are strong; I'm tiny but I can knock a few back. Well after my second drink I conjured up the nerves to talk to a cute bearded fellow who smelled like some W.F. fair-trade lavender/lemongrass body wash; when my polyester pencil skirt gave way and I slipped off the stool mid-convo! The worst part was that the DJ cut the song and my "AHHHH" echoed through the joint before the beat dropped. We giggled; and he was cool about it, but I was mortified. So I got another drink and we left shortly after the "Trash-room experience"...UMM okay I'm curious as to how you can vomit and hit everything in the stale but the toilet, was she spinning?! Thank goodness I wasn't wearing my glasses. 
The men's restroom door was off the hinge and a guy showed his "Package" to my friend and she didn't mind the size *Nice!* 

AWW just like SD. maybe even better (less pretentious atmosphere and a great music scene) so I guess I'm not homesick after all.This is not the worst Mexican food I've ever had. 

It isn't the best either, and ultimately I'd say it is about average, or slightly better. The service here is pretty friendly, or rather, over the top friendly. They just give you the run of the place to pick where you want to sit and what you want to do. They are extremely nice. 

It's inexpensive food, and the chips and salsa are great. The place does get very very loud on the weekends and has a lot of screaming kids.Hubby and I came here for the margaritas.
Okay okay, I came for the margaritas and dragged my husband and kiddo along with me. 
We decided to just split the gigantor appetizer platter. A guy came out and made my kid a balloon puppy, which he was terrified of, but it was a really neat gesture. Everyone was so friendly. I practically had to beat the waitress off with a stick to get her to stop refilling my water and salsa after each bite/sip.
The platter came out on an XL pizza dish and smelled to die for. I had no idea what I was eating as it all kind of looked the same (good mexican should look the same going in as it does going out though, you know its true) but it was fabulous. Im not sure if the cheese was real, but I don't think I care. There was a ton left over to take home and attempt to reheat later, too, and they had to roll us out to the car.
But the margaritas? Nothing special. I didn't even get a refill, and thats rare for me when around cheap booze. The bathrooms were pretty gross. Hence the star deduction.

Its cheap, it's fast, and its a greasebucket. The folks are friendly and there are biiiig ole TVs and paintings of parrots. What more do you want!?Pretty good. Probably won't return though.A solid, no-frills  neighborhood salon/barber shop. Friendly barbers, quick service and great prices ($15 for a men's haircut).When I was a little kid my dad would take me to Cowboy Mel's on Main and 2nd Street in downtown Anoka, MN (population 15,000). Me and Dad bonded. Mel smoked a cigar. I learned of Guns and Ammo magazine. Soon a swanky salon, called Barbie Baker Design opened on Main Street and my mom started going there. Well, I was a young, fresh, bursting at the seams, pre puberty, pre knowing I was a homo young man. One day mom asked if I wanted to get a "style cut" (WHAT IS THAT?) at Barbie Baker? I said yes. Mel was stinky and the magazine selection sucked ass. 

When we walked through the doors of Barbie Baker Design (not Salon, not Shop, but Design), the heavens opened up and the choir sang. I was in my element. Cool straight chicks and a gay receptionist named Bruce. Well. I bonded with the salon community. And ever since then enjoyed the salon experience. From Beverly Hills to Manhattan, I've had some fabulous follicle indulgences. 

Here, in Phoenix, I'm lucky enough to receive the BEST cuts from Amina at Ide Mania. Well. Today. I.Snapped. I just need a quick cut. It's July in AZ. It's like a freakin' sauna. Anything to make things cooler. 

Cut to Great Clips in a glamorous strip mall on 7th Ave and Osborn. Me entering. Nervous. Sweating. Embarrassed perhaps. 

Less than 30 minutes I left with a PERFECT summer cut. An enjoyable time with my "stylist"...I mean really there was no shampooing and she never used a scissor. But. I looked good. I mean hot even. I blew kisses at the mirror. Paid my $13 tab and threw a Lincoln her way. Yea. That's how I roll.

I love the salon experience. But I have to holla at Great Clips and the staff. Clean space. Friendly and efficient staff. And Rickie can't stop complimenting me. That is worth $13 times a hundred!

Sorry Korina.Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Not the most amazing Thai ever. I do highly recommend the coconut ice cream.I've been here several times over the last year, and like others have mentioned, I've found it a little hit or miss on taste and quality.

Tonight I got my usual favorites of Pad Thai and the Yellow Curry, and the total came to over $22. That seems expensive to me, at least compared to many other Thai restaurants I've been to.

And also, they want $2 for a side of rice. That's a lot. At least they give you a good amount to begin with. There were also no shrimps in the Pad Thai, despite being listed on the menu.

And what Thai place doesn't have limes?I'm not going to take a star off! BUT!!! My dad was here for two weeks, and probably will be back again soon. In that two weeks I was here about 11 to 13 days, about five dollars a day for parking. Wish there was a better way to help out with the parking, only thing that would help is if I stayed for more then six hours a day! Then they can validate my ticket for three dollars! He did come back since my last review, the room was better, but still noisy! I had to go out and ask the people in the waiting room to calm down! There were at least seven kids on the floor wrestling!! I thought I walked into the lucha libre contest!! I do not blame the kids! They are just doing what kids do, but come on parents! Start acting like parents!!I have a natrual affinity for grease...so reading the reviews, I had one of those "aha" moment...square peg, square hole.

But..(sorrowful violin in the background)...me and FBH...we just weren't meant to be...I was looking for a bit more crisp in my deepfry relationship...while FHB had that mysterious salty yeasty flavor that I didn't even know that I was looking for...it was seriously lacking that soul-filling crispiness that break against my teeth on first bite before falling into pillowy steaming breadiness

Conclusion:  Definitely worth a try if you haven't had fry bread before.
Now that I tried it...I'd go back if I'm in the area...but personally not something that I would drive out of my way for.I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!

The ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.

I felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good.Called one day, had an appointment the next.  It was explained this was a facility for training interns.  I assume the U of A.  I am OK with that.  They gave me a gate code so I'd have a parking spot.  I performed the usual health history & intake routine.  I was treated well, taken quickly to a "Yellow Team" appointment room.

This was an appointment for a physical exam.  A nurse took my vitals, did sight and hearing tests, adding my results to a computer system that was not behaving well.  Whenever I step to a service counter, the computers go to strange inner places.  I am mostly patient with computers but think anyone wanting a Singularity Chip implanted in their brain does not really work with computers realistically.

The doctor was thorough and friendly.  I was offered prescription refills.  I don't need them from this facility.  I was told there are extended hours here, same-day and weekend appointments to save emergency room visits.  

I'll continue using the services of Peppertree Family Practice.You get what you pay for here.  For $2.50 per garment, you'll get your clothes dry-cleaned, but you could pay more elsewhere for a better pressing with fewer wrinkles.Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as wellFound a roach in my drink today. YUM YUM! I didn't make a big deal, I expect bugs in my food no matter where I eat. They brought me another. I was more upset by the fact that I my pho bowl looked smaller, or did my stomach get bigger?When you walk out of the beat up parking lot, look up the aged store front, walk pass into the aged low decor 1970s style interior, and get seated by the waiters, the visual setup creates the expectation that the food would be on par-disappointing. But you would be wrong, the food really is good here commensurate with the price.

We have a big menu of affordable dishes to order from . After we ordered our food, they arrive within a reasonable amount of time. The imperial Hue soup is flavorable, spicy and temperature hot, and filling. The seafood floured soup is one of the best and non greasy dish that they have. The seat-in experience is acceptable; save by the food. There is not a whole lot of customer to employee interaction.

This is not a place to experience a quiet dinner(as there are noisy kids) or to impress a date. It's a drive by, eat and get out place.

If I were to come in just to order 2 dishes to-go, the wait could be an agonizing 15-20 minutes. The wait could feel like forever as there is nothing to distract the customer like a TV. Better luck calling in with a menu in hand.

Overall for business improvement on a dime:  I would recommend they 

1) Update and remodel the outside and inside decor to make it attractive for outsiders to come in.
2) Work on lessening the variability and wait time from the cooking by lessening  the number of  similar menu items. 
3). This family run business works way too hard such that they have no spare slack to make improvements. 

The food outperforms the other experienced qualities. Given that there are lots of good Asian restaurants nearby to chose from, I hope to see them do some innovating from a service and experience perspective as other local Pho places are progressing in that direction.Well, I decided to start the year off right. And go to Church. I have to admit I hadn't been to Church in quite awhile. Such a sin. I know. I didn't get all dressed up but I did do the sign of the cross when I entered Church's. Oh. I meant to say Church's earlier in the review. Not church. My bad. How silly. What a silly yelper am I? Church's. You know. Double battered fried chicken. Deep fried okra. Powderd mashed potatoes. And the mac n cheese. Why the latter is indeed heavenly. And a sin at the same time. I'm not gonna compare the grease sticks here to the grease sticks at KFC or Popeye's. All kinda the same to me. But I can tell you the offering from Church's soaked up the booze from ringing out 07 the night before. Grease be with you. And also with you.Came here for a quick bite during lunch. It's small and clean.   My order came out fairly quickly.  I had a chicken bowl.  All and all it was a decent lunch.   I feel it was a bit pricey for a bowl of rice and chicken.I've been happy with this place, but they are inconsistent with their estimated times to pick your dog up. 
One time I was told 2 hours and he was ready in 40 minutes. Today I was the first one there and was told 3 hours. All for basic bath and tidy.
I will be trying somewhere else next time.This is one of those "they know your name and drink" kind of bars. I'm a newbie, so I felt like the friend of a friend at some dinner party. 

The drink selection is decent. The mixed drinks I found to be a little high priced. $8.50 for a shitty martini? I think not!

They have a deal from 11am-3pm of .99 cents hamburgers, but apparently the catch is you have to buy a drink in order to get the burger deal. Without a drink the burgers are $4. I think that's a rip off. The burgers are decent, but not worth $4 or having to spend money on a drink just to get the burger for a buck.

The jukebox is decent. A good mix of everything from Depeche Mode to Springsteen, lame top 40 and some pseudo country. I didn't dare play a DM song as this crowd looked like they would have lynched a Euro pop loving girl.

They need to add more tables and chairs and dump some of the bar games.

I'd give the place another shot as it's walking distance from my house, but you can get a better deal on drinks and food elsewhere.If three stars in Yelp parlance is "A-OK" then I give this place three stars.  It's been my Chinese delivery option for nearly five years, and everything that I've ever ordered from them has been slightly above average.  If you're being a hermit for the night and want reliable Chinese delivery, then this place is as good as most, and better than some. 

As a side note, I once decided to pick-up my order rather than have it delivered, and based on what I saw, I'd probably not eat on-site.  The actual restaruant is singularly unappealing from the inside.  That doesn't factor into my rating in this review, however, as their delivery has never been anything other than prompt and their prices reasonable.Had a flat tire, so i went back to Discount tire where I bought the tires. The nice thing is I had the warranty, service was great, was there 1/2 hr.. Did a great job.. 
BUT.. when the service guy checked the tire, he said a few times looks like the tire may have to be replaced, may need replaced, might have to replace.... Then I said I have the replacement protection..... 1/2 hr later they fixed the flat, didn't need replacement.. Makes ya WONDER!! Hummmmm... Hope it really didn't need replacement.. I drive a lot...Great location, great lanes. Service is good (although the bartender is super strict about IDs- and I am obviously over 30- but I'm not mad, she's just doing her job). 

The reason this place gets three stars instead of 4? The beer is ridiculously expensive. $20 for a bucket 5 and that was with a discount? 

We also were on two leagues last year (short summer and fall/winter/spring) and I felt like it was way too expensive and the payout percentages were not handled well at the end. For that reason alone, I wouldn't do another league there, although it was really fun (and my fiance scored his first 300... actually he got two 300s in a series, so he racked up his 300 and 800 rings which was super cool.)

Otherwise, it's a great neighborhood bowling center.It's great because it was a weekday and no one else was there. :)Leinenkugel Summer Shandy on tap is a great start!

The burgers start at $6, and jump to $12.

The Original Wineburger is pretty good, but nothing I'd write home about.

It's a nice atmosphere, but the location isn't exactly convenient.For now, Crazy Jim's gets 3 stars. That's a fair, middle of the road rating for a decent restaurant. Apparently, I didn't realize it was a Greek restaurant, so what do I do? I order a Ham and Pineapple calzone. It wasn't the best I've had but it was still pretty good. My lunch companion ordered a gyro with a side of pasta salad, and I have to say that it looked better than my meal and cost about three dollars less. I tried the salad and the abundance of feta made it taste great. 

Other menu items include subs, pasta and salads (with or without lettuce. All the breads and crusts are made fresh daily on site.

My only complaints with this restaurant are that it's very, very small. So small that I noticed a table pushed entirely into the back corner so that only two chairs on the exposed sides could be seated at it. Also, I was quite literally back to back with the gentleman dining at the table behind me. It was also fairly busy (which speaks well for them and their business) and difficult to hear what my friend was attempting to tell me. Oh well, I doubt it was very important anyway...

If I go back to sample the Greek fare, I may be tempted to add a star but until then, this rating is based primarily on my choice of entree.I'm on a search in the area for Fish tacos and came across this place via Yelp. I think I was here maybe 5+ years ago and if it is the place I'm thinking of, they had good cerviche. But on this trip I ordered 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco (my M.O.) to see how they were prepared. There was a good freshness to the cabbage, tomato and avocado on the tacos. I liked that they gave me the crema sauce on the side instead of plopping it on there. The fish tacos were better than the shrimp in my opinion. Both were fried but the shrimp were on the small side. There was a nice saltiness to the batter to give the tacos extra flavor. Without even asking I got extra limes which I appreciate.A pretty good place to eat. I had the turkey, which was surprisingly moist and tender. I'm not wild about the glasses they serve beverages in, or the decor of the place in general, but the food was above average. The gravy was rather 'meh', and tasted as if it had been  a store brand purchased at a discount market down the road. The only genuine disappointment is something I can't hold againt My Mother's restaurant: the rolls. Dinner rolls in places like this usually taste like rubbish, and unfortunately this was no exception. Everything else was spot-on, though. I enjoyed myself, and plan on eating there again.Very nice clean Subway. Staff was friendly but a little slow and my wife actually made a comment on how skimpy they were with the veggies (this from a 110 lb waif). You could do worse than this Subway. Recommend.So I've now been in Angie's and Jimmie's Pizza shop twice and so far I'm really liking it overall. There are some off putting things but as far as this neighborhood goes it's pretty great.

Pros:
-The Pizza is delicious. And pretty darn reasonable in price. I always get a personal for $5 and it is quite a big pizza. 
-The cheese is yummy!
-The sauce is just the right kind of semi-sweet.

Cons:
-The older woman who works at the front is quite, well, snippy. She gives off VERY unfriendly vibes and makes you feel like there is something wrong with you for ordering pizza in her store.
-The store is dirty. The kitchen doesn't look dirty but the outer part is really dirty.

I would never eat here as a dine-in but I'll definitely take my food out. It's good as long as you don't get grossed out by the sticky floors. Again, the kitchen DOES NOT look dirty.

All in all, three out of five stars. Clean the place and brighten the attitude of the woman and I'd give it 5! (Everyone else there is really friendly.)3.5 stars. Relatively good place to eat. Friendly with good service. The price for the all-you-can-eat beef ribs was only 15$. The clam chowder was okay, beans were decent, sweet potato fries were not bad either. The beef ribs had parts that were over cooked but since it's all you can eat ask for as many beef ribs as you want for the parts that are not overcooked!The motel from the outside looked ugly and very unappealing. It was really dirty and seemed a little abandoned. 

The room was nice. It was clean and didn't smell like the other reviews on here. We had room 348. The cable on the other hand was not good. It would be clear for a couple minutes then all of a sudden it would be really blurry.I'm disappointed to report that dinner last night was underwhelming. Maybe the time to go is for Dim Sum.

Pros: *a huge dining space
           *a huge menu
           *a good selection of vegetarian options
           *Pepsi products, including Mt. Dew

Cons: *fish tanks with dead or dying seafood (isn't the point to keep     them alive?) I nearly squealed when I saw they had geoduck, which I have always wanted to try, but then was repulsed when I saw the glazed eyes of the red fish all around them in the same tank.
            *too many servers for each customer. I think we had a different person bring us each item. Doesn't this add to the confusion when there is already a language barrier? There were several errors made (I was brought the wrong entree, they forgot our soup, etc.).

I know we'll try Great Wall again, and here's hoping that someday, some restaurant can replace our beloved Big Wong. Maybe Great Wall will grow on us...My wife and I arrived here around 11:00 there was an extremely  Long line, but it moved fast. Inside the place was packed. There wasn't any additional seats, they were booked to capacity. When we checked in with the hostess we were asked if we would be willing to be seated with other people. We said no problem but when our name was called we ended up with just the two of us at the table.

The dim sum experience is not for everyone.  Those not accustomed to the noise and crowds should stay away. The place was Jam packed with Chinese families which was a good indication of how the food would be.  

All the carts came around frequently. Service was standard for a Dim Sum restaurant. Nothing much to complain about or compliment.  This place was really crowded. It was a bit uncomfortable because the tables are really close to each other, and the aisle aren't hat wide. With the carts going around the place it can get super cramped and uncomfortable. Oh, it was also super noisy, but that shouldn't be a surprise for such a crowded establishment. The servers pushing the carts around were hard to understand so I have no idea what we had or what was in the food but I can tell you we enjoyed all the dishes we picked.

None of the dishes really stand out. The food was good, not spectacular, but Just your standard dim sum fare. With the exception of drink refills because no one came around to refill our beverages.

FOOD: The menu is standard Dim Sum. PRICE: Expensive -This accounts for why I rated the place only a three. My wife and I spent $30.00 on lunch and didn't really have that much food. I can't imagine what families must spend here on a big meal.   ABIANCE: Nothing fancy but you don't come here for the ambiance you come here or the food. SERVICE: . CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was high for what you get. The décor was non existent and all tables/chairs were all covered and not the most comfortable. However the Great Wall managed to satisfy that dim sum craving but was not even close to the best I've ever had. The search continues. RETURN  FACTOR: 90- 95%

************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTTypical traditional Chinese restaurant. Heard its the better of the food restaurants here that are open late. Foods not bad, restaurant could use a facelift and a better sign outside/Door, but good thing I dont live in AZ.I've been to this Denny's a few times since I live so close. Luckily, I kind of like this Denny's because I know I'll end up here again some time. It's inevitable.

I'm usually in here really really late (or early). My last visit was at 11:45 pm though.

We walked in & it looked like a disaster zone. I guess they hadn't had time to clean up after the dinner crowd or something. While we were there they vacuumed & started cleaning up.

Our server seemed really new. But I'm not rating poorly based on her service. Everyone needs to be able to learn the ropes without judgment. And just because your server is new & isn't perfect doesn't mean you tip her $2 on a ticket for 4 people. That's lousy.

Pro's:
The various tv's scattered around that play music videos or sports.
It's cozy here. The decor is nice.
They were able to get my omelet order right.
The nachos are SO good!
The strawberry mango pucker or chiller was really good. Perfectly tart. YUM!
The staff is usually really friendly & don't mind joking around with you.

Con's:
My milkshake was more like chocolate milk. Not even close to thick really.
I asked for my hash browns crispy. Didn't really come like that. They're called hash BROWNS for a reason.
The side salad was huge. But it's just iceberg lettuce. Yuck. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing is way too sweet too.Ordered a grande latte and asked with no flavor (can't have sugar or anything), almond milk (no flavor at this location), so got it with soy milk instead.  After I tasted it, I can taste the syrup flavor in the coffee, I asked for no flavor because I know they would put something like syrup in it and they screwed something this easy.  Starbucks need to retrain their baristas to make sure they can listen better.  I went around lunch time but the store wasn't all that busy at all.  They need to pay more attention on what the customers need and not just about how much money they can get from it.  I never had any problems asking what I want at other locations, not sure why this is a problem.  I'll probably give them another try if the management would reply this message back to me to see how we can resolve this issue.This follows on from my scathing review of the location on Bell road.  

After cleaning the review I sent it into their corp office and had a phone call within a very short time. I declined a meal at the same location.There's something about praying to the porcelain god that puts me off a repeat performance.

Side note: When the Yard house stiffed us I suggested they give the cash to charity, a waitress or anything since we wouldn't be going back there. 

Seemingly they can't so I gave it to the first person that answered my FB status. In short I don't want free anything I just want them to carry out their half of the deal and let us pay for, eat , and enjoy our food without rectal ramifications. 

We ended up accepting a try out at of another Lone Star just off I17. I Didn't hand the letter from corp office to the manager at the start since we're  not interested in how  "special cases" are handled.   

It's kinda a mixed bag. The server was really good, great with the kid and  timely with the delivery , checking and asked all the right questions. 

Steak not cooked correctly  but they do ask everyone to check and it came back great, really really good steak. 

Yet the transposed orders of the baked potato ( barely serviceable)
Wrong kids meal , chicken strips instead of cheeseburger combined with a slowish service wasn't selling us future visits ( they are under 5 mins from the house)  

They did take care of us by making up some soda to the kid's specs, not bad for a 3.5 year old to get a custom drink. It's 2.5 rounded up to 3 for experience . E.g  staff 4 stars, food 2 :)This must be some type of "combination store", it's set up like Albertson's but seems to have a lot of generic brands some I haven't seen before now. The store is clean and the staff is very helpful. The prices seem to be good, however, since I didn't recognize some of the brands, the cheap prices might reflect the off brands. 

Overall a decent grocery store. Not sure if we'll be back in, we visit Phoenix often but usually stop in a grocery store at least once a trip to pick up some "Bill Johnston BBQ sauce" and refill the cooler with ice. So we tend to hit different stores depending on which part of town we happen to be in at the time.Cheap. Convenient and they deliver. Food is definitely not gourmet. But its not completely bad. I give the taste a 3 out of 5. Friendly drivers. Can barely understand the lady over the phone but just tell her what you want and they'll deliver 30 min or lessFresh salad was just what I needed on that hot day.

I wasn't happy that chicken, and bleu cheese are premium ingredients, and that either was an extra $2.49 (which I didn't get), but meh.

I'd go back, but not often.2 stars for free wifi that works & one outlet yay!! Place is dirty and your older burger king when given a choice I'd go to the one on Peoria ave next to metro center mall and barnes and noble, love that one clean, new looking, free wifi. I just love their cleanliness I feel like a clean service area = a clean kitchen! This location was dirty, I washed my hands in the bathroom and it was not very clean. They do however have this deal going on pretty amazing! $1 for a small caramel frap, mocha frap and smoothies for $1 dollar yes!! beat the summer heat with a refreshing ice cold drink from BK! lots of parkingThis restaurant was featured on Check Please Arizona and the reviews were really really awesome on that show. We drove quite a while to get here and the food and ambiance were just mediocre. Nothing like what the people on the show said. 

The Shrimp Fajitas were good and their chips and salsa are really good. The seating is dark antd dingy if you are not in front of the windows. Ask for a booth near the windows. 

We also had the vegetarian fajitas which were okay. The sides are way too much and no one really needs to eat THAT much sour cream. The server we had was a delight and very attentive. 

I will probably not go here again considering it is very far from me and very greasy food. They did let me know that they do not use lard or other animal products to cook their food with including their tortillas, in case you are wondering.I've been to Fajitas a couple times with my co-workers for lunch. I had chicken fajitas with a margarita. It's the perfect lunch portion. They come with enough sliced chicken, red and green bell peppers for about 3 fajitas.  I recommend adding a side of guacamole to go along with the pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream.  The tortillas are also made fresh however they are a little thicker than your average tortilla.  The staff is extremely friendly and they get your food and check to you very fast which is great if you have to run back to work. The margaritas aren't too potent but they are flavorful.   They have a variety of lunch specials to you to choose from and reasonably priced. My lunch itself was $7.99.I've been coming here since the 80's when the restaurant first opened. I love Fajita's - the best dish is their namesake. Warm fresh chips and mild salsa is served upon arrival. We always get the shrimp (sometimes chicken). The tortillas are cooked fresh in house, and they are awesome.  The food is great and the service is great. The only reason I can't give more stars is because this place REALLY needs an update. It still looks like it's from the 80's. The carpet is really old, the walls need to be repainted - dirty looking and scuffed, hand scrawled signage that says to "watch your step" (can they get professional signs at least?)  the booth we were in had a piece of wood trim falling off into the booth with nails exposed (if management reads this, we sat in the back, along the window) and the bathrooms are really old (original?) There used to be a long wait to get in on the weekends - now, you just walk right in. I got the feeling they must be strapped for cash if they can't update the decor from 1986. Even the reviews on the walls from magazines are from the 80's. It's time to come into 2014 and freshen up. Decor aside, the fajitas are great and I hope they will be in business for years to come. I just got the feeling the restaurant itself wasn't doing too well.This is like a standard room Ctyd Marriott.  Had to ask for a fridge to be brought in & it was big & luckily already cool unlike others where it comes in warm.  No wireless.  Very short ethernet cable.  Best rate was $59 so it was not expensive.This was my first pick up order from Steaken Burger/Long Wongs during my lunch hour as my co-workers have ordered wings and the phenomonal smell always filled the area, so thanks to the folks at Groupon, I tried the place and we placed a pick up order.  The staff was very helpful in placing the phone order and the food was ready promptly when we arrived.  I had ordered the steaken with provolone, green peppers mushrooms and a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were some of the best, probably #2 I've had in the valley.  I don't eat them all the time, but when I'm in the mood, nothing like a side of onion rings.  These were huge and had the perfect amount of breading and onion.  The steaken was ok, I mean it's huge on a 9 inch hoagie roll, but there should be like a choice of wheat or sourdough, and ummm where is the provolone and mushrooms?  BTW-something else is missing on this-- flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but I'd much rather have a 6 inch sandwich that has some shi-bang flavor than a 9 inch with ok flavor. On a sidebar, when I pay extra for additional items on the sandwich I should be able to see them.  All in all, though I'll give this place another shout, maybe if I get their cheez-wiz next time I'll actually see the cheese.A few years ago I decided that having three or four chins was unattractive, so I decided that it was time to hit the gym. I decided to join LA Fitness and began seriously working out at this location to shed some  serious pounds. The gym itself is fairly large and has a lot of equipment but has some drawbacks. First, the place is very dirty and until recently didn't offer any sort of sanitation for the machines or weights. In the summer, or whenever it's warm, the air conditioning seemed to be jacked up making the facility uncomfortably warm, which only encourages more sweating.  The televisions upstairs are a joke... the screens must be 13" if that. Add on the weird crap going on in the men's locker and that was enough for me to find another gym. So, other than the few distractions, I felt comfortable working out here and didn't feel like I had to impress anyone. Three stars for getting me back in top shape.Stopped in for a Sunday Breakfast before a baseball spring training game. I have to admit that this IHOP was a bit smaller then the ones i have been too, but they did a great job, there was one young girl in the front that was a bit silly, but everybody else was fine. Service was quick and efficient. I understand its like any other IHOP, but they do a good job with their space and the quantity that arrives to eat there. 

So if your in the area and need some food in your system, stop in.The place was a great hang-out bar. Nice people, casual, layed-back atmosphere. Bartender was nice. Service was a little slow. But, there were nice people to talk to while we waited. I will definitely return to this lovely dive bar.OY CARAMBA!

The last time I ate at one of these Caramba's someone there highly recommended getting the Salpicon Salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make. It's listed as a salad so I was expecting a salad.

I did ask them to leave off the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up a little for me. But all this salad appeared to be a fried flour tortilla smeared with beans topped with a small amount of lettuce with a very small amount of fresh made plastic tub like chunks of chicken and topped with a big glob of guacamole. To me it looked like a tostada. It was a $6.25 tostada. I read on a sign that the chicken and a bunch of other stuff is made fresh every day and is never from frozen. I also didn't eat the fried tortilla the food seemed fresh but it was a small amount of food.

 TWO STARS for the Chicken Salpicon Salad 

I also had a Margarita and it was so strong I thought I tasted AntiFreeze in it and I also thought it might make me grow hair on my chest.

My husband liked the Carnitas Plate. He said it was nicely seasoned and the meat was moist. It came with rice and beans and a giant flour tortilla that could hold a small body.

I'll leave them at three stars because my husband liked the carnitas here.

We were going to have a donut next door at Lamar's but it was after 12 and they were almost out so you might want to check out Lamar's before lunch.

All the Caramba locations are open everyday for lunch or dinner.Macayo's is comfort food.  They'v kept the same menu for years with good service.  You know what you will get and that you will have leftovers.  It's also fun to browse the Goodwill in the parking lot after eating.  Cheese crisp is crisp like it should be - not soft.  Beef taco is a meal in itself.Anyone that knows me, knows I have a sad love affair with Barro's Pizza....

However, there was just something not quite the same here.  The people were very nice. The place was ok, a little odd (even for Barro's standards).  

But there was something that just wasn't quite Barro's-ey enough for me.  The crust wasn't totally what I was used to, the cheese a little bit different, and it was all just a bit haphazard.  

I'll probably be back because it is on the way to-and-fro. But something just wasn't on par.  Maybe it was just an off day......This Barro's location has been a regular, Friday night outing for our family, for several years.  But, I'm not sure I'm going to be going to this location, in the future.  The employees are great, and I can't ever remember not getting great customer service, but lately the wings have been coming to the table, cold and to steal aquote from Peyton T., the Fresh Sewer Smell has been a little over the top.  This has been going on for months and they have attempted to aleviate the problem by using industrial deodorant, to the point of it wafting out to the eating area and making your food taste, just like it.  I've mentioned this to the management, but they just seem to want to put a bandaid over the problem.  I love supporting business's that are close to my house, but I'll probably start going to the location, near Moon Valley.The food is always fresh and pretty good. The problem is that they always screw up my order. No sauce for my chicken strips, the wrong type of hot dog, wrong type of shake... I can go on and on. Yeah, I could check my order before I leave, but I shouldn't have to.It was a fun experience, but the coffee and food were not great. This is not fancy, just plain diner food. The servers were really a lot of fun and the experience overall was ok.The tortilla was good but everything else was forgettable. I am from San Diego and this food is nowhere near the standards that I am use to. It's too bad some people don't get to try real mexican food.If you're looking for cheap apartments this is it. Though our rent frequently changes due to the water bill. Management had handled some work orders previously complained about. The community itself is nice. Just out of date in the rentals and square footage is an issue with more than two people.Well- it isn't Cabela's. But it is close to my house and isn't filled to capacity with people every time I need to go in and get something. Prices are comparable to Bass Pro and Cabela's- sometimes quite a bit cheaper depending on the item. Staff are generally helpful, and the store is clean, well organized and well stocked.Q is a local dive type bar and grill in North Phoenix. With that being said there are not too many N. PHX places to eat lunch. I have been here several times and usually enjoy the food. Today Not as much. 

I elected to go with the burger and frys. I wanted something not fast foodish and a real piece of meat. Nope, it was almost as bad as fast food. Sonic... yeah, it was a Sonic burger. 

i will stick to tthe fish.I got my regular - Big Burrito Especial - Chicken.  Yummy.  I swear they use different tortillas here, it was really good.  I like staring at the fish in the tank.Rubios is right on the corner near the theater. They have been there since the complex opened and have always done well. Then place is lean and the staff efficient. 

The food is average but good. 

Today I had 2 Fish tacos beans and chips. 
The tacos were OK the fish was just a little on the soft mushy side but not bad enough to no eat. The flavors are all great with the cabbage and the Baja sauce. 
The beans are refried with a heavy pepper taste (my kid won't eat em) with a little sprinkle of cojita cheese. I like the beans. 
Chips are thicker and small but are a nice add on to the meal. 

The price was good something like $5.75 or something with only water to drink.I was craving something last night and couldn't figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time.The first time I tried this place I ordered the shrimp and broccoli plate with lo mein. The shirmp had no flavor and was submerged in what looked to be oily water . I decided to give this place another try and had their chicken teriyaki which is amazing. Their crab ragoons are phenomenal, and the lady their is so sweet. She is always complementing me :) My boyfriend is actually on his way to pick up our order :)Good, standard food. Definitely a chain that's consistent - I've been to several around the country, and they're all pretty much the same. I go for meetings, but only once in a while on my own. It's a bit pricier than similar chains, and doesn't really offer anything to offset the cost difference.Not sure exactly, but it seems to lack quality or pride and that's been reflected in the food.. We just weren't impressed.A bit blah really.. They USED to have huge portions - not any more... Menu is a bit restricted, especially when compared to somewhere like The Cheesecake Factory. Service was mediocre... All in all, underwhelming and uninspiring.Happy hour is pretty solid!  Good place to go with kids as well.  The pretzels are delicious.  Their pot pie as great but do not eat it if you are going to eat any more food the rest of the day.  Ambience is pretty old school.My issue is with the customer service skills of the owner, Sharon. I am a regular here and have had the same issue everytime. My 5 minute transaction turns into a 20-25 sabbatical because Sharon will stop working on my business to not only answer phone( no issue with that ) but start new business with the phone customer. I have watched as she minimizes the computer screen to look up prices for phone customer, go to the file cabinet to pull paperwork, go outside to continue phone conversations, and such. Sharon, politely tell the phone peeps that you have to put them on hold and take care of the live person standing in front of you. There is absolutely no reason live people come second to phone inquiries.Yet another restaurant that started with much too high of expectations. I heard from the construction boys that this was the best place in town. I mean, they really hyped it up! But I forgot that it was what it is- fast food. Good fast food? sure. But quick, and greasy! I'm not completely against grease by any means. I love their baby banditos. those little tiny morsels of goodness dipped in that butter... stuff... mm mm mm.. And the horchata.. very tasty. That is a good breakfast for me and I have enjoyed it on numerous occasions. But to tell you the truth, if it weren't for that butter stuff and their clever way of making tiny chimichangas and naming them banditos I wouldn't see much more in this place than I would in your typical albertos, filibertos, juanbertos, carlosbertos.. and all those other berto joints. All good, sure. But don't expect to feel your best after devouring, and also don't expect top of the line ingredients. So I may stop here again, if I find myself wandering in my old hood.. but as long as I'm over here in downtown, I will stick to the selection here.Yes, it is Cracker Barrel,

However -

We eat her one or more time a week. We are "regulars," most of the staff remembers us.

The food here is always consistent, and besides one or two instances - the service is always good as well. 

My wife likes the Lemon Pepper Trout, and I eat a few different things here. The meals are priced well, and filling.

I don't much care for all the "American!" merchandise in the "country store" that is made in China, but I do like that some of the stuff hanging on the wall in the dining area is actually old.

Because of or work schedules we eat here at random times, sometimes for lunch, sometimes later at night. 

It may be a "chain" but at least it is one of the better ones, and this location is always consistent in it's service and quality.My daughter only gave it two stars I  will give it a more generous three. Last night I had a hankering for Japanese food , I was tired yet wanted something we hadn't tried before. So we ended up at Bamboo, which we have passed literally a million times and never gone in.  I was thinking what if this is a little gem and it's been here the whole time. 

The service was fast and not bad , waitresses were very attentive and thoughtful.  But the food just didn't match any of our wishes. I was also distracted by large carpet stains on a dark rug , you have got to really make a mess to stain that bad. So get it clean up people ( Can I recommended EPIC carpet cleaning ?)  The best part of the meal was the miso soup which was pleasant and had mushroom, tofu and chives  nice taste from there it just was as Bri said meh. I picked up a piece of Ginger at one point  and said this it the tastiest part of the meal .. aren't I funny?  I ordered Tempura cuz I have wanted  to  find tempura for my mom  but this just tasted like onion ring batter on all the veggies and very greasy like an onion ring . Great if you are PMSsy and want  fried veggies.. than it would be perfect.  
The sushi we ordered was unremarkable , a mediocre caterpillar roll with brown avocado ,  a Las Vegas roll  that just tasted blah  and something else I cant remember .   
I would only eat here if people threatened we were going to Olive Garden or this place , I 'd take this place.The Desert's Edge RV Village is located just north of Phoenix in an industrial area. A good location while visiting Phoenix.
The staff is extremely friendly an nice. There are lots of amenities-heated pool and hot tub, dog park ( walking area), community room with a pool table and games, and a nice laundry room with newer washers and dryers. 
The space provided  is big enough of a for a class C and comes with a picnic table, a small concrete  "porch" and a extra parking space. 
The only negative is you are packed in like sardines. There is not any privacy between you and your neighbor.Michaels is one of my favorite stores for art and craft supplies. The layout is similar to other Michaels I've been to back in Northern California. Unfortunately, nothing really stood out with this Michaels. I just browsed through the rubber stamps and the scrapbook section. The Christmas clearance section was a bit small. I didn't buy anything.This panda is very slow but food is worth the wait!This place was okay, I paid 28$ for a fill with gel polish. I had a woman with short hair do my nails. I was early for my appt and ended up waiting 10 mins passed. She was polite and took her time. Although there were periods were she would help another customer. She did break my nail and never acknowledged it. However she filled the break with acrylic and you actually can't tell. It was decent but the final job has those pores (air bubbles) in it. And my nails aren't as smooth or thin as I like. However I've had worse so it's not a big deal. I did notice the woman next to me that the man who did her nails was great at it!My girlfriend told me we were meeting her mom here for breakfast...

I thought, "Ok cool.. bar and grill for breakfast."  I guess years ago this place used to serve some good breakfast, but in recent years because of the economy, they stopped and only have a few things.

I guess I thought since this was a small place with only two cars in the parking lot, that we would be in a so-so experience.  Of course this was at 10:30AM...  But we sat down in the bar area in a high table.   A nice girl came to help us and get us a menu.   We learned that breakfast really didnt exist, so I ordered some wings and was surprised that they were actually pretty good.  Not amazing, but not bad either.  I ate about 8 of 12 of them. 

My girlfriend and her mom ordered a couple drinks; I had some Coke and that was about it..

Would I come back?  Sure, but not for breakfast...  Id probably check it out in the evening time.Flightline is closed. Hopefully Brigett reopens it with an outdoor patio, air conditioning that is turned on and tables without duct tape.Small easy access airport.  Friends flying their own up from Tucson tell me they prefer it because they can avoid the Phoenix Sky Harbor airspace.

For those of us who don't fly, it is easy to park when meeting friends.  The restaurant is clean and serves adequate food.  There are plenty of things nearby if you have friends stopping in, and I don't remember any security hassles as all the traffic in and out is private.I like it. Prefer to Taco Bell because DT has better hot sauce, IMO. 

They are usually great at the drive-thru here, but last night we sprang for the higher-priced tacos to get the sour cream and tomatoes. TOMATOES? CHECK. SOUR CREAM? NOPE. Obviously not worth a drive back for twelve cents of product, but easy enough to Yelp about the experience. 

Love the jalapeno rings. Hot, not like most of the jalapeno popper-type items at most place.This is an older Target location which is smaller than the majority of the other locations in the area.  They seem clean and well organized, however, due to the size and age of the store, they don't have the same variety available.  It is a great place to stop off for basics or a quick run for something, but probably wouldn't head here if you are looking to do a major grocery trip or need to stock up on a fair amount of items.

The staff is always friendly and parking is relatively easy!

Overall: B
Not the size and variety of other locations, but not a bad stop off for basics!Good price on gas.  Convenient location.  NOT a "food store."  
Bring back the diet pepsi slurpee damnit.Typical greasy spoon diner fare, which is what you should expect going in.

I can recommend the scramble - with jalapenos, as they use fresh jalapenos with a good bite (spicy). Other than that, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a traditional diner. Coffee, hashbrowns, etc. Not overly amazing, but not bad either. We normally just go when we have a coupon to burn there for a buy-1-get-1 free meal, etc.Sunday morning my husband and I wanted to go out to eat a hearty breakfast. We've eaten at this restaurant before, so we knew what to expect. This place is located in a run down strip mall, but has a very low key casual atmosphere. No dressing up required here. Slap on a ragged shirt and jeans, and you will fit in right at home. The place is open 24hrs, so if your out parting and want some grub you can stop in anytime. We arrived at around 8:30am in the morning. There was no wait time before being seated. 

  The place was pretty packed with people so we got seated in the back room. The restaurant is packed with booths from corner to corner. One thing you will notice right away when you sit down is the spacing from the seat to the table, it's very close and makes it a little uncomfortable if your not stick thin. Also sitting down and getting up takes some effort. I mean I'm not a beast but a couple more inches could help. I noticed this was a problem not only for our booth, but looked around and watched as others tried to squeeze into there spots as well. As we looked around the waitress seemed pretty slammed and a little worn out. These waitresses kind of remind me of the waitress from the show Alice, a little ruff around the edges. Our waitress was pretty fast at coming around to get our drink and breakfast orders. We were served two glasses of water right away. There menu has pretty much everything you would expect any breakfast place to have, so you'll end up with a classic plate. 

  I ordered the biscuit, egg, and sausage gravy plate, with some home fries. I think it was combo #1 for $6.99. The waitress asked if I wanted home fries or hash browns, I said home fries but got hash browns anyway.. Go figure. My husband ordered the omelet with sausage and cheese with some hash browns for the same price. Anyways, the place was packed so I thought for sure our food would take awhile. But no, it came out super quick and was two plates of a lot of food. No way could we eat everything. We started eating and it tasted like some good home cooking food. 
   
   I really don't expect much out of breakfast food, because an egg is an egg. The food was average, nothing to rave about. The service was quick, and we didn't have to wait like at the Good Egg or Denny's on a weekend for breakfast.Nice hotel off Hotwire for $62 including tax. New tv, pretty quite, friendly staff, door had balcony opening to the pool area,plenty of parking and side doors close to each group of rooms. 

They lost one star for their atrocious new years ever 'entertainment'. Bar had LOUD obnoxious trendy club hits, the ghetto versions, not even the top 40 radio edits. No mystery why everyone was stnding outside smoking. It was also Club Fulfilled night, which is once a month, and is a group promoting size acceptance of obese people. I'm all for equality, but don't think you need to form a fat club to take over a bar to have a good time.

In room coffee was pretty great btw.
Also, indoor pool and 24hr fitness center (small, better than nada).

They lost another star for no shampoo (2 conditioners) and black dirt stuff in the tub. Not how I likes my baths. Overall, I would stay here again, but plan on off-site entertainment.It was an okay stay. Nothing special. Room service messed up our order but management took care of it the next day. Indoor pool was nice but it did make the place smell a little weird. All in all, not bad for spring training.Food was good, fresh and hot. Customer service was solid, but the location is pretty dresdful.I don't know if this place passed sanitary inspections but the number of pool tables is fun...smells funky too :/Went there with my boyfriend, and it was okay... the food wasn't all that great  but the service was.  the employees there were really nice.I love the environment. You can sit in here for an hour and look at stuff on the walls. oh yeah. Did I mention the food is good too. . . 

I have to address the staff issue. He hires nothing but high school or young college tooth picks who don't have a lot of customer service skills. But like I said just like all the memorabilia and photos on the walls and tables it's fun to look at.this guy is freakin rude. i brought my saddlebags for my harley to get carpeted he promised a particular day. and  it wasnt ready. don't make promises.....dont be rude when customers call to ask for items that were promised.....the workmanship was fantastic.
  you deserve more..take this as an opportunity for improvement.. good luck craig!Indeed Altata does have some of the best seafood ever! The reason why I am only giving three stars is because of the service.  I cannot emphasize enough that if your a women eating here with out a man and your not ordering things left and right you WILL receive the worst service ever. Every time I've visited we always get ignored biece of someone else. I once waited thirty minutes just to get someone to run my debit card. I've learned to just get up and tell them to do it. 

The food like I said before is what keeps me coming back. Although I no longer eat inside I always order  .  It to go.Not too bad.  Stopped here for a doughnut on my way to work and got a chocolate long john and a glazed.  The long john filled me up so that was it.  It's a small shop that resembles an old fashioned Duncan Donuts.  Good placeFood was ok more or less nothing to special fortunely it did not cost to muchFood is good but not mind blowing good! Honestly is equivalent to home cooking! But it's cheap GREAT portions & good customer service! they claim to serve gyro but it's a joke! I go back for the hungry mans special for $7.99 I get 3eggs, hash browns, 3 slices of bacon, 3 sausages all u can eat pancakes & toast! That's a great little mom & pops breakfast joint! Good for a cheap budget!Pizza was ok.  Not the best or worst I've had.  Pizza was pretty greasy for me.  Salad was good and their Italian dressing is what did it.  I'd go back.  Probably not for their pizza, but I'd try a sub.While on a road trip to Sedona it was past dinner time and we were getting hungry, so I checked Yelp to find a place to eat that wasn't your typical fast food choices. Wongs had 4 stars and enough reviews that I decided to give it a try. When we pulled up in front my first impression was that it doesn't look like much from the outside. When we entered I was quite surprised to find how large it was inside. Very traditional Chinese style decor with even 2 levels of dining.  The restaurant was dated, but clean (including the bathrooms) Our server was very friendly and brought hot tea and water.  I ordered the Chicken with Broccoli in brown sauce. It was good, but not great.  We also ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice which was also good. My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken.  If you are a big eater, you will love the large portions. There was enough leftover food for 2 more meals. Would I go out of my way to eat here? Probably not, but for me, much better than a fast food chain. Very standard Chinese food.The location of the hotel was good for us because we needed to be close to Goodyear.  It is fairly close to a zoo, shopping mall and CARL'S JR (which in my book is a major plus).  It is *right* off of I-10 and in the opposite direction of the freeway it got pretty industrial but we had Chinese delivered so there was some semblance of life around us.

The staff were nice enough and even helpful a few times including when we left something in the room and they made sure we got it back painlessly.  

We did go out and enjoy the pool, which was cooooold but clean and didn't totally reek of chlorine.  There was no hot tub, which would have been nice but we lived and probably so would the next people.

The room was pretty clean and it had a mini fridge and microwave.  I do have to say that I am a comforter remover (bleh) and the blankets they had on the bed were pretty ragged...not terribly warm, not even close to soft but for $67 a night, I guess I wasn't expecting Cashmina.  The beds *seemed* comfortable when I laid down but a couple of mornings I woke up a bit achy.  That could've been me, it could've been the bed.  I am not totally sure.

The tub was nice with a slanted back but we had to put some saran wrap type plastic on the drain because it would slowly leak the water and we had to keep refilling it.  Once I MacGuyvered that little technique, we were fine though.

Overall, we had a nice stay and I would most likely stay there if I needed to be near Goodyear again.  We had no major issues and sometimes that is half the battle.  :DOK. As far as I know and correct me if I'm wrong: This is the closest Waffle House to the People's Republic of California, about 360 miles as the BMW (illegally) flies.

Done seeing your favorite team (go Manny) in spring training? Done visiting the Heard Museum? Managed to curtail your wife's urges to shop in Scottsdale? Reward yourself and visit the Waffle House, check the menu and eat away.

Strangely surreal, as if you entered a movie set. Or a Southern Culture on the Skids You Tube video bit. I have always enjoyed waffles in the early afternoon since childhood and this place makes the grade as I sit down with my fellow early afternoon feasters. 

Happily irreverent is Waffle House. Just check out their website if you cannot visit. Enjoy!Too small, tables all close to each other not the best place to go for breakfastProbably one of the cheapest places to get petrol in town.  If I'm in need of fueling The Tank and I'm on my mom's side of town....I stop by here.I've been in here a few times now, some to donate and some to shop, and I think this place is a okay.  They have a great selection of clothing, mostly women's and some men's with furniture and housewares as well.

The store is well organized, and the prices here are great.  I picked through some of their skirts, men's tshirts, and housewares sections to see what they had.  I did see two really nice kitchen tables for sale, but since I don't need a kitchen table, obviously I didn't buy it.

I was hoping to score some candles here, but I didn't see any.  But, they had some really great stuff back here, so maybe next time.  The hours are okay, but since it's a Mormon run place, they are closed on Sundays.  So, if you want to get any shopping done, make sure to get it done Monday through Saturday!

If your in the area, stop in here.  It's worth a shot.  Place is clean and smells okay too.I like to go here to grab some subs on the way to the river, since it's between our house and the 17. Just because I don't want to go to Subway or Blimpie's.

Mostly, it's a rather expansive Italian market. Need olive oil? They have 20+ different kinds. Pasta? There's a whole aisle. How about one of those wooden thingies for making gnocchi. Got that too.

In the back, a counter runs along the whole length of the back wall. That's where you'll find all sorts of cheeses, cold cuts, and sausauge, plus a few sweets. 

It's also where you order sandwiches. And you'd better know exactly what your want, and fast. The man behind the counter is perpetually surly and curt. It gets worse if you stand there and try to make heads or tails of all the hand-written sandwich combinations taped to the wall. Luckily, the woman who runs the cash register is always very sweet. So that kind of makes up for it.

I want to love their sandwiches. I just don't. They're OK. The meat is always really good, there just isn't enough of it. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things. 

Until then, I'll continue to support Romanelli's, but they'll only get a so-so rating for the deli. The product selection, however, is top notch.A neighborhood ethnic place in yet another ubiquitous strip mall. I thought the food was good and the owners charming. I had the lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous. I thought is was good not great. It needed more seasoning and I relied on some red spicy sauce we all passed around to give it dimension. If I am ever in that neck of the woods again, I would definitely try one of the tangines. 
We need to support places like this and enjoy the diversity in our neighborhoods!The Starbucks inside the bookstore is own and operated by the bookstore and not by Starbucks, so any of your Starbucks GC will not be accepted there.  That was a bummed thing to hear.  Overall, the bookstore is pretty clean, bathroom is very clean too, at least that's what I saw when I visited them.  Location can be better as you can't see it from the main road.No this place is not aesthetically pleasing, but the food is tasty, pretty cheap and the service is friendly. The lamb souvlaki is good but the lamb seems to be more gristly than others I've had. The rolls are amazing! I gave it 3 stars because there is better Greek food out there, but this quite good for how cheap it is.Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...After seeing a advert claiming that Schlotzky's is not just a sandwich I had to find out for myself. Upon entering the restaurant I was pleasantly greeted by a kind worker and bountiful menu. The rueben sandwich was pretty good and all but not quite worth the 7$$$. The bathroom was comfortable but for a single person and my time in there felt rushed. 3.5 out of 5 stars.What a long day!  We drove for five and a half hrs and finally made it.

We checked in at 3 pm after M's wedding.  I took a short nap and found the room to be cozy.  It had two nice swimming pools.  Unfortunately, I forgot my swimsuit since the night before I was running around the house like a mad woman trying to get my stuff together.  

If you're not planning to hang out at the hotel all day, then this place will do.The only thin I get here is there ravioli de portobello. Never really tried anything else. But I'm a fan of that ravioli. 

Also alittle tip if you go for dinner you can still get lunch size incase you're aren't thy hungry and it's still lunch price. I have a feeling no one tells you that when you're ordering.Aubrey was not the first time I had a date at Streets of New York.  (See Aubrey date at SNY on 6730 E Thomas Rd in Scottsdale.)  In May 2007, I had a date with Sara.  Normally, I love Streets of New York, but this location was not very good.  Go to any of the other locations.  The pizza tasted like cardboard.  Just kidding, it was better than Domino's!  I told her that the pizza is normally better, but this location isn't very good.  She reassured me saying it was good, which was the right thing for her to say since it was our first date.

Like Aubrey, Sara was a great date as well, but she was kind of weird.  I didn't try that hard to pursue a second date.Meh. 

the hubs has a hard on for this place and I cant really figure out why. Vito's down the street is ten times better. 

They do have green olives, so that's a plus in my book. 

Its really just pretty average pizza, nothing great, but not dominos or pizza hut either.It was a decent experience.  The kids and I had just finished 7 hours of rides at Castles N Coasters and were thirsty and starving.  We started driving north around the Metro Center Circle.  The first contender for dinner was Olive Garden.  I pulled in and saw the groups of people waiting to be seated with pagers.  We had no time to wait.  We kept driving and saw Swensen's.

The place was almost empty.  I ordered the veggie burger and it was decent.  My girls shared the chicken strips and hated them.  They had big chunks of pepper in them and it was to spicy of a flavor for them.  When I told the waitress her response was that they are not spicy and everyone loves them.  I thought that odd and she never offered to remove them from the bill even though no one ate them.  I don't remember what my son ate- possibly a hamburger.  

The highlight of the meal of course was the dessert.  The huge sundaes were DELICIOUS.  The bill was $38... one adult meal with drink, two kids meals, one premium sundae and one scoop sundae.  I think that is pricey.We decided to go to Mimi's because my husband had never eaten there and it had an eclectic menu- everything from quiche and crab cakes to ribs and burgers. We had the zucchini spears with parmesan as an appetizer- it was flash fried, so not greasy, and the veggies kept their texture. 

Hubby was well pleased with his strawberry lemonade (it was quite tart and yummy) and with his French Dip with cheese, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. It was not as rare as we are used to from Houston's French Dip (the planet's best, we are convinced), but still moist and quite generously portioned. 

I made the horrible mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I'm not sure what that was on my plate, but it was rubbery and tasted vaguely of fish. The sauce was tasteless and had a nasty been-sittin'-around- too-long film. The waitress came by quickly to check on us and took away the badness (I was very nice about it to her face, of course) and brought me the BLT I should have ordered in the first place. It was delicious and had I don't know how many rashers of bacon goodness on it. 

All in all, the service was excellent and everything we had except the chicken fried steak was good. They corrected the problem very quickly and with a great attitude.Potential but just OK.  Booth is comfortable.  Waiter is friendly.  Keeps refilling my coke.  Food is OK but could be so much better.  Their niche is serving non-traditional chain food.  I didn't want anything with fries or potatoes so I gave them a try remembering they served quiche years ago.  I ordered the corn chowder with scallops and the crab cakes with micro-greens.  Crab cakes very good.  Chowder had been on simmer for too long and scallops were rubbery.  I would order the crab cakes with just a cup of chowder (no scallops) next time.  I'm going to go back and try the quiche next time.Went today to see what was available in the waterbed world. The sales staff was extremely helpful & definitely has the best selection in the state. Things in the store were a little dusty, but salesman was extremely helpful & informative. I wasn't sure if we ordered anything it would be ordered or given directly from the store. I'm not sure if things in the store are even available to purchase anymore.  Overall, it seemed they are the most informative in waterbeds. If we purchase we'll definitely purchase from here.What Korina says about this place is dead-on!
http://www.yelp.com/biz/west-marine-phoenix#hrid:dXDOGM1mJC4GnsWtjq4h8QIf your a sports junkie this is the place for you. This place if covered wall to wall with T.V.'s. The service wasn't to good. It took a while for someone to help us but by the end of the night it got better. The food is good. We had pizza and a few appetizers. Its reasonably priced. Good beer selection. The place gets full pretty quick so go early.Really good food and they do offer delivery.  My husband LOVES the Amazing Chicken.  The Lemon Chicken is really good too.   Most of the time I would call ahead and stop by on the way home from work.  They do offer delivery so that is an added perk.
It is a strip mall restaurant that really needs to be updated so if you are seeking ambience you won't find it here.  If you want good basic chinese food then you will like this place alot.My bro & I requisitioned some calzonez at Native New Yowka for lunch yesterday. Mine was a veggie.

The thing was "A-Ok", but didn't quite have as much mozzarella as I would like in my crusty baked pockets o' cheese. 

All in all, the Naive Nu Yowka is no comparison to a good calzone spot like Oregano's, Pizza Heaven or similar.Not bad, but not great either.

My friends like to go here to meet and hang out... and yeah, I'll be back.  It's pretty much middle of the road.  I have other joints like this I'd rather go to first.

I like the wings, I like some of the other stuff... their kitchen takes FOREVER though.  It's like, did you have to kill the chickens first???

The service is friendly although they tend to be a bit slow in refills of soda or water, but real quick to refill your beer.The bartenders and management are great! Food is reasonably priced and you get a ton of it. I would steer clear of the karaoke on Saturday night.....the music is good but the folks that think they can sing are rough to listen to. I have had great service every other time we have been there and the staff tries to make that personal connection and recognize you by name! Kudos on that! Everyone likes to be recognized. The fish fry on Fridays is great too!Greek mafiosos aside, I find King Gyros to be a good cheap lunch grub type of place.  

It's a counter style lunch joint (wedged in the Mervyn's shopping center) with tacky Greek beach posters on the wall, classroom carpet, corian tables and cedar chairs. 

I come here quite often and usually order a chicken gyro plate with fries or the greek salad, and they're both tasty, cheap and does the job.  In particular I like the gyro sauce with its yogurt sauce, spices and fresh dill.  

King Gyros is not exactly a standout type of place, but I find it to be a solid choice if you're in the area.

It can get busy during the day, but last time I was here Nico and Demetri rolled up with their entourage in their club clothes and a pricey Mercedes at 2 PM.  Klassy!I shop here a lot so I'd say I'm almost a fan.  I personally feel they are slightly overpriced compared to other places, however the products I use for my hair I can only seem to find here.  Although they are slowly fading off of their shelves and being only found on the internet.

I have this friend that loves doing at home dye jobs and she usually makes me the hair stylist, forced to buy products from Sally's I really have no clue what I'm doing 80% of the time.  Thank god for google instructions right!  But I'd say more of their hair dyes are ment for professionals.  If you don't know what you're doing you'll screw it up.  Example I had a friend do her own hair with stuff she bought from sally's.  She wanted to go from jet black hair to platinum blonde but the girls at the front desk didn't really know what they were doing or talking about and gave my friend bad advise.  I'd say there only purpose at the store is ringing people up, don't ask questions of them on how to do stuff.  You're honestly better off like me googling stuff on facebook and looking up youtube videos.  My friends DIY project from black to blonde with their advise turned her hair orange.  She went back and asked for more advise, stupid her, and it ended up more platinum but with a blue tint to it.  By the time she went back a third time to get advise the last person seemed to know what she was doing but had advised my friend against bleaching it again.  Which of course my friend didn't listen and her hair fell out.  Perhaps if my friend found the 3rd cashier the first time around.  But hey like I said, they are there to ring you up, not to give advise so if you for it, double check what they say against the internet at least.

If you take their advise and it screws up your hair or something else, then it's kind of yoru fault for not forking out the cash and going to a professional.

Like I said, I believe them to be over priced but they do tend to hold products I can't find anywhere else.3.5 ez stars

They have a meal that is over 11 bucks...lol

We had a nice quick simple dinner here. The staff was underdressed and a little unattentive but i do not go here for wait service. 

We had 9 of us and 5 were kids. They made the food to perfection and nothing was old, cold, or bad. 

I was impressed.Food is the standard fast-food.
Store is clean.
Staff always seems extremely bored and lifeless when I go.
No smiles. More like "Here's you food, now go!"
The fact they do not take BK coupons miffs me too.The pluses:  

The food was reliable Good Egg food.  Great portions, great taste, great price.

The server kept up with our crazy speed of going through pots of coffee.

The bummers:

The host (some super old lady) tried to put a party of six (which included 3 people over 6 ft tall) in a booth meant to only comfortably seat 4. Even though there were empty tables EVERYWHERE.

For the volume of business the place was doing at the time the Kitchen was pretty damn slow.

Server seemed overwhelmed at times. We asked for one item 4 times and never received it.  He was nice enough though.


Overall.  Still nothing beats the service of the Tucson Good Egg. But this one ranks as one of the oddest level of service for one visit off all the Phx locations.  Half great Half crappy all in one visit.Top Shelf has decent mexican food but they are a bit more expensive and don't offer the same value as say Garcia's.  I have been there at least 3-5 times over the years and I have always left happy but I am about not having to spend too much money if I don't have to especially If I can get the same food and service ( Garcia's ) for a little cheaper.

If you live in the area give Top Shelf a try.  They have good food and service.  They are just not my favorite.So my coworkers and I had decided to try this place for lunch the other day, and their sandwiches were mediocre, their 5 layer brownies were good but a bit too sweet for all 4 of us that tried it.  I also had tried the cinnamon roll which was decent as well. Personally id rather just got to cinnabon for then drive all the way out there for theirs even though theirs is Huge.  I had also ordered the sugar cookie which i was expecting to taste like those cake sugar cookies with frosting was a normal sugar cookie but with frosting. So not my cup of tea but im sure plenty of others that need a good sugar rush would enjoy this immensely.I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplishedDecent location in what I would consider the not so fabulous section of Mesa. The lady at the counter was super friendly and I was in and out in no time with my $.69 Gatorade Peace A town, I'm out of here!The hubby and I went here last weekend to see the Peanuts exhibit.  He is a big Charles Schulz fan. I had pretty low expectations because 1. It's Mesa and 2. It's a kids museum.  Not exactly how a dink wants to spend their weekend.  But we actually really enjoyed the exhibit. There were a ton of kids there who seemed to have a lot of fun getting dressed up and playing with the props. The exhibit definitely had more to offer kids than adults.  I would have enjoyed seeing more original drafts or signed pictures/copies.  But the descriptions of character development and historical anecdotes of Schulz' life were really interesting.

Overall, it looked like this place doesn't have much to offer anyone over the age of five.  But because of special exhibits like this one (the Jim Henson one Lisa N. mentioned sounds like it was cool, too), I may return in the future.  Especially on a free admission day.Been here with out of state guests to do the whole "tourist" thing.  Nice way to spend a few hours.  The music and the jokes from the Captain are corney but it is enjoyable.  It was interesting to listen to the narration regarding the building of the local recreation areas around the lake, the formation of the rocks and interesting facts about the local flora and fauna.  We got to see bald eagles and sheep.  All in all, a good couple of hours out in the sunshine and fresh air.The people who work at the pharmacy are nice and do their best. As usual there is a line sometimes to get medication.Great overall selection, friendly help, and just an overall good vibe here.  Only downsides are that so many beers are stored at room temperature and I've had a few expired beer issues.  It's also not exactly a nice location as far as safety goes, and I've had issues with homeless people outside in the small parking lot.

Don't be turned away by the exterior - they have good stuff on the inside.Top notch service, and a really friendly staff, but the following are actual texts I sent during the time I was there for a simple oil change:

I've been here so long, they may just offer me a senior discount when I'm done.

By the time I get my car back, it may be time for another change.

By the time I get my car back, it may be considered a classic.

By the time I get my car back, it may need snow tires--if hell's already frozen over, Mesa may not be far behind.

By the time I get my car back, the price may have tripled from inflation.

By the time I get my car back (your 5-year-old son) could drive it home.

By the time I get my car back, cars may be obsolete and I'll need an oil change in my hovercraft.

By the time I get my car back, Captain Kirk may want to borrow it.

What I'm trying to say, is that despite all the smiles and the deals and the very, very proficient gal behind the counter, I sat there in the (not so entertaining) lobby for 2+ hours waiting on a simple oil change. Being from out of town, I'm glad the Yelps led me to a reputable place and they did a terrific job, but I could have done without the wait.I don't get the hype.

Bean tacos- just okay.  Spinach enchiladas- just okay.  Chips and salsa- just okay. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.I have eaten at two different locations of Serrano's the one on Power Road and this one. I personally think the food is prepared better and the service is much better.

I think the food is usually pretty good here. I have had an occasional mix up on the order and not getting the same food you ordered. That would be my only issue.

But my observation every time i dine here the place seems understaffed. I see servers with too many tables on different sides of the dining area. 3 different staff take your order, bring your food, and serve drinks. 

I would say A+ on the staff that bring salsa and chips rock! They always get you what you need in a timely manner.Popped in there the other morning looking for breakfast and an alcoholic beverage after getting off the night shift.   Pickup trucks lined the front parking lot.  The sign outside said they served breakfast, so I ducked inside to check it out, wondering if it was as seedy inside as it was on the outside.   

I was not disappointed.  This bar opens at 6am, so I was thrilled to find your standard handful of blue-collar hardcore drunks sitting at the bar....nursing their beers and making small talk.  Even though I rolled up on my bicycle, wearing gym shorts/t-shirt and slinging a bike helmet and backpack for chrissakes, nobody really seemed to notice, much less give me the ole stink-eye. 

The linebacker sized lady bartender was friendly, she smiled to greet me and came over right away to ask me what I'll be having.   They had a full bar with three macro beers on tap.  I asked if they were still serving breakfast and she explained that they haven't had a kitchen in years.   Maybe it's about time they took down the signs outside advertising breakfast, lunch and dinner, I thought to myself.  

She suggested that I try Bill Johnson's Big Apple restaurant just a few doors down for breakfast, so I thanked her for her advice and hit the bricks.

I will file this dive bar away as one of the few places where you get a drink at 6am in Mesa, just for future reference.This Jamba Juice used to be awesome, but now it's just filled with teenagers who don't know what's going on. I went in today to use my Groupon. It was 2 smoothies for 5.00. I went in to get 1 smoothie and asked if I could get the other one later. She said "No, dont you want to get the two now?" When I told her I couldn't drink two original smoothies and there was no one else to drink it, she just shrugged and looked at me with a blank stare.
So I left, and called the next closest Jamba Juice. Funny enough when I asked him, he told me they could definitely just use one and give me a free smoothie card. Ended up driving an extra 10 minutes out of the way, just for a smoothie.
Lame.I was in the Phoenix area for some meetings for work, so that always means a trip out to a few nice dinners on the company. Our team event was held at the Broadway Palm and there was a total of 24 of us. 
First, let me say, musicals are not my thing, so going to see "George M" really didn't float my boat. Upon getting some drinks before the show, we made our way to our table. As we entered the room, I soon realized that our group was the youngest by at least an average of 20 years. I think the average age of the room that night was 70. 
The food was decent - it was a buffet, so it can't be more than decent. I was tickled pink though when I saw a GIANT bowl of turkey gravy. Giant. I love gravy, and having that there gave this place an extra star. 
The desserts were a buffet as well, and nothing was spectacular, but nothing was really bad either. The service was friendly. The roast turkey was pretty good, and so were the salads, but you really can't screw up salad. There was some strange looking white fish on the buffet that did not look like fish. 
We arrived at the theater at 5:30 and the show didn't start until 7:30, so that didn't help much adding to the appeal of the place. 
The show was entertaining, and the actors did a great job and could really sing. I always can appreciate things I am not good at, so it kept me entertained. Not my cup of tea, but if you are into musicals, it's probably worth a visit. I won't be going out of my way to go there next time I am in Phoenix.I think the food was decent but WAY overpriced. I have no problem spending money on a good meal but this was a little stupid. The tiramisu was the smallest portion I have ever seen....and for $7.00...are you kidding me? The pasta sauce was watery and the risotto was bland. I wish I were more impressed, not to mention, when I ordered dinner the man who took my order wasn't exactly friendly and seemed put out by my call.I don't come here that often, but it's pretty good. And when I ask for gummy bears they put TONS in there! They never skimp."Complete Auto Care?"  I don't think so!  These guys are okay for brakes, oil, tires and basic stuff... maybe shocks/struts?  Go to a real mechanic shop for anything bigger than that.  I had them work on a rear main seal on a jeep grand Cherokee and had to go back in 2 times after that... for them to completely redo the job both times.  Needless to say,  it still leaked after 3 tries.  At least #2 & #3 were under warranty.I have been here so many times as family comes in town or friends who love to go here, but I as of recently have thought that it was all ok. When I was younger, I loved to go to Vito's with the family. The last few times, it has taken some time to get food out and the food has been ok, I have gotten pasta dishes as well as the pizza. I have to say that I do enjoy the atmosphere here.My dining experience at Vito's Italian restaurant was different to say the least. My friend and i arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday evening and the dining room was at full capacity, which was to be expected. We were greeted by the hostess and were told there was about a 20 minute wait. I asked the hostess if we could sit in the bar area which had four tables that were not being occupied. There was one person sitting at the bar. the hostess told us we could go ahead and seat ourselves, which we did. The bartender, who was also our server looked at us when we say down, then proceeded with her conversation with the customer at the bar. Ten minutes went by and i had made eye contact with the bartender several times as she still hadn't come over to give us menus. I'm assuming her conversation was over because then she came to our table, mind you,  it was only three feet from the bar at most and asked if we were ready to order. To be honest with you, I almost laughed. Instead I asked if we could see a menu. She said, "oh yea, let me grab you one". she brought the menus over and started to walk away. I said, "excuse me, do you think we could order a drink?". I ordered a miller lite and an iced tea, and my friend ordered a glass of water. Five minutes later we had our drinks, again keep in mind the bar is no more than three feet away. The bartender came over with our drinks and says " are you ready to order?". My friend then asks her if he could have a crown and coke. She says "yeah", then walks to the bar and makes the crown and coke. She leaves it sitting on the bar and proceeds to walk right past us to the dining room area. She is gone for at least ten minutes. I can see her in the dining room talking to another employee. She walks right past us again, goes behind the bar and starts talking to the only customer at the bar, yet again. At this point I'm a little irritated. I walk up to the bar and ask her if i could have the crown and coke for my friend, she says, "yeah, sorry" and goes back to her conversation. Five minutes later she returns and asks what we want to order. I order the bruchetta as an appetizer and lasagna for my main meal. My friend orders the chicken parmesan. The bruchetta arrives and is absolutely amazing. I like that the restaurant puts feta cheese in the bruchetta and the bread is soft, not hard like I've noticed in other restaurants. The main course arrives and my lasagna looks mouth watering. The sauce is sweet and the cheese is just melted to perfection. I believe it's the best lasagna I've had, other than my mom's, just in case she is reading this! We finish our meal, in which the bartender never never came over once to ask how it was and we wait for about fifteen minutes before she brings the check. I hand her my debit card and she brings me the receipt to sign. I notice the amount I signed for isn't the amount of the bill she brought over to me. I mention this to her and she realizes she ran my card for someone else's  bill. Wow, is all I can think at this point. She corrects the problem and brings me my bill. All in all, the service was terrible and the food was amazing. The question is, would I eat at this restaurant again? The answer is yes. I would request a different server, and hope for better service. I would recommend the food to everyone.Huge selection of home decor fabrics(get lost wandering around for an hour huge). Great pricing on things like foam pieces, pillow forms, etc. The staff are really friendly, local business types who know a lot but won't cater to snippy customers. Got to see a high maintenance woman get taken down a few notches last time I went. Always entertaining. She ended up admitting they were right and thanking them for saving her money, it was hard not to applaud.

Minus a couple stars because the designer fabric prices are a little steep, they don't do any sort of coupons or loyalty program, and I got a ridiculously uneven cut of fabric last week. Next time I will be sure to measure the piece BEFORE using it so that I can return it if it's uneven. Would have been nice if they offered to give me a discount when I had to go get more but that's what I get for cutting into it before measuring. 

Closed weekends(even Saturday) so plan accordingly.This place is exactly what you expect.  Tables in every nook of the drawn out building means plenty of seating.  The kitchen is quick and the servers are pretty good (but lack any charming personality).  The place has all sorts of random junk you can buy if you are into buying postcards at your breakfast stop.  It is a decent experience.

Where it gets me down is the food.  I ordered my typical Texas Toast french toast and it was beyond boring.  The pieces were small and had no hint of extra flavoring.  The syrup was bland and tasted store-bought.  

What I wanted was home-cooked goodness for breakfast.  What I got was cookie-cutter blandness.  Too bad, this coulda been a great place.This place was ok. 

We were driving around trying to find a place to try in our new neighborhood and for some reason the building here sort of stood out. It didn't really...we were just hungry.

When you walk in, as the name suggests, you're overwhelmed with Iowa stuff which is interesting. To your right would be a bar (in terms of sitting at the bar to eat your meal) and a couple TVs). To your front and left is the seating which doesn't have any kind of privacy. You could be inches away from the table next to you.

Sitting there looking over the menu kind of reminded me of Joe Pesci from My Cousin Vinny when they ordered breakfast: "we'll take two breakfasts". There is plenty to choose from it just felt limited at the same time, if that makes sense.

The service was good.

The food itself was nothing to write home about. We'll only come back if we want that midwest/southern feel.A friend of mine had food poisoning from here 4 years ago..but since then I have noticed a great change in their quality. I have come here many times, its great to come for decent priced sushi. Its never too busy and they have a huge menu. They also have teppanyaki grills which is fun with family and friends. Have not had the food though so definitely check it out and let me know what you think!We've been unfairly using Osaka as a baseline for Sushi and Japanese food in general. This place was ok.Okay...so you get a HUGE portion so make sure you're hungry when you go! The bread sticks and sauce is SUPER tasty, but to be honest, the chicken parmigiana was so-so. the breading on the chicken was mushy and the flavor was bland. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but I wish the meat and overall flavor was better. The waitress was pretty much MIA for most of the meal which wasn't helpful.

I'll probably go again to give this place another try, but I'm hoping my experience will be better.Ate on the patio since it wasn't too warm.  The server was pretty confused at the beer offerings and couldn't explain them.  A little preparation is a big plus if the word "Brew" is in your name.  The waitress was adequate once we got past the beer debacle, but not tremendous.

Had the Sea Bass with a side salad, and corn polenta.  The fish was a little over cooked, the salad good, and the polenta was excellent.  All in all, worth another try, since the seafood menu was extensive for the region, and a restaurant of this size. 

 Could easily give them 4 stars if they tweaked the fish prep and the beer knowledge.  In fact, giving them a second shot tonight, and I'll be surprised if they can't garner 4 stars.  Give them a try and see what you think.I was randomly in Mesa with two people who also have no knowledge of Mesa. We ended up here and it was fine - but probably not the place we had in mind. 

Red, White, and Brew is like a glorified Applebee's. Lots of families, lots of wood booths. Based off the name, I was hoping to be blown away by the beer selection, but it was pretty standard. 

Maybe the real problem was that our server was a little odd. Very friendly, but odd. He stood a little too close, came over a little too often. One of the odder things was that he snatched my full glass of water because there was no ice in it anymore ... that had been intentional - I don't like ice in my water and had been waiting for it to melt. Again, not ill-intentioned, but a little odd. 

We ordered the pita pizza appetizer and it was cold - the cheese partially melted. Meh. The mains were all fine - but again, very comprable to an Applebees. 

I don't live anywhere near here, but if I did - I wouldn't be back.Not my favorite of the local baristas but it's Starbucks...terribly consistent.Home Depot......Where else can you go to get what you need for those home projects you should have called someone else out to do that could have done it in record breaking time but your too cheap to pay for something so you do it yourself & after evaluating your performance as well as the amount of time it took you to achieve the crazy project you tried to tackle, you realized you should have called a pro! Now on the flip side of the coin, as a pro, I appreciate your valiant attempts to save money & sometimes thankful you didn't burden me with your desires. hahahaha! that was a fun little tangent to go off on. I gotta say thanks to HD for offering a military discount!Just your regular Home Depot location. I was disappointed that we had to ask three people where chain lube might be, only to find out they didn't carry it after going on what seemed like a treasure hunt around the store. Oh well - would try again for more generic requests. Clean store.I remembered the good time I experienced here on our mandatory 6th grade field trip years ago, the jumping on trampolines, and the hand waxing and soldiers jousting tournaments. The nostalgia from years ago brought my friends and I back seeing if we can recreate new memories. Not surprisingly, it's a completely different experience as an adult.

The Arizona Renaissance Festival is a cash cow. You just go there to spend money. That's it. Tickets are $20 at Fry's grocery, $21 online, and $22 at the venue. But if your not a kid, the only thing to do there as an adult is shop. And shop for what? Renaissance things that you can really only use or wear at the Renaissance festival (I'm pretty sure my golden elf ears and leather medieval corset are not apart of my work's dress code). So you spend money on useless Renaissance attire, you spend money on drinks, and on food, and games, and event. The Renaissance Festival is not cheap.

Now if you have kids, it's justifiable. People throw down dough to keep their kids happy and entertained and the Arizona Renaissance Festival is perfect for that. But if your a 20+ year old with no kids and looking for a fun time, there are better options in Arizona that are cheaper and more fulfilling.i'd give this place 3.5 stars

i went here for a birthday dinner for a friend of mine. i thought the place was  neat, customer service was great, the food was delicious, but it was too overpriced. 

i think that's what i'm mostly reviewing on is the price of their food. although, it was yummy, i don't know if i'd ever go there again to pay for a $25 plate of korean beef. 

i mean, if you guys can afford to fork over some $$$ then be my guess. i think you'll get your moneys worth. the quality was excellent and worth your time to try it.I wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't that good.

We had the beef and the shrimp.  The shrimp were not tasty, veins everywhere.  The veggies with the shrimp tasted decent, but looked kind of shotty.  The beef was good, but it was really the only thing I would look forward to eating again.

The sides were all decent and interesting, but really there wasn't one I would call memorable.

It has been a long time since I last ate Korean food.  I remember loving it.  I didn't love this and I was really trying to like it as this was my pick against my wife's better judgement..

The one thing I would say is that you don't need to order more than 1 meat for 2 people.  We ordered two and it was more than twice as much food as we needed.  Although, if it had tasted better, we probably would have eaten more.

I'll give it 3 stars, but that is probably giving them the benefit of the doubt.Went for happy hour, service was great drinks were good, but the food was SO SO.. Prices were very reasonable, atmosphere is nice. These folks are new to the happy hour game perhaps they will catch up! We are rooting for them because they have a great patio and wonderful owners.This is a great place for happy hour or late night drinking in downtown Chandler: awesome bar, live music and a fantastic patio.  I finally had the full dinner experience here last Friday and I actually thought the food was pretty good, too.  The hubby got the chicken mole which was very tasty.   My fish tacos were good but nothing special.

Their chips and salsa are really awesome.  The chips are hearty with a good flavor even on their own.  They are thick enough to stand up to the bean dip which is a must try item.  We love that they have Pacifo on tap but my husband was disappointed that they don't have Bohemia (even bottled).  The other stars on the drink menu are the margaritas in various flavors but since I don't care for tequila I can't comment on those.

On the night we ate there we experienced similar service issues as other reviewers... long wait for a table due to lack of bussing, no silverware until after our food arrived, etc.  Our server was busting her hump but they were just way understaffed.  She managed to stay cheerful and friendly so that's a plus.  To be fair it was Third Friday that night.Approaching the front of the building, I was instantly impressed with the theatrical lighting on the outside of the building, the foyer is large, ruby red and created a grand mood when I walked in. They even had large crystal chandeliers.  

The theater itself is a nice size, not large, but sits on the medium scale. My seat for the Christmas production of the Nutcracker was on the third row, center and the view was nice. There didn't seem to be any room for live band or orchestra, but the sound system was full.This place has been recently renovated (as of September 2009) to include a Wal-Mart grocery store. I don't think it qualifies as a "Supercenter" because it lacks a McDonald's and a bank and a vision department and all that. But I was pleased to be able to have an alternative for grocery shopping in the neighborhood.

After some growing pains experienced in their inventory, they finally started carrying the Yakult probiotic beverage in their dairy section. I drink this stuff daily to stay regular (become friends with your intestinal flora, I say), and have been miffed to find that it sells for $3 a six-pack. But this Wal-Mart carries the cheap, Mexican alternative Bio Salud for 88 cents a six pack!

But allow me to climb down from my gastrointestinal soapbox... The groceries at this Wal-Mart are not always the best quality (e.g. the bacon I purchased was quite fatty, and the shredded Parmesan was less flavorful than most), but you can find some bargains here. And then there's always the rest of the store to explore for those random items you never knew you needed.For late night shopping, this expanded Wal-Mart really does the job.  I'd still rather give my money to other companies, but sometimes they are the only place open.

The renovated store is much nicer, but some of the items seemed to be in weird, unexpected places.  I have to say, they did a nice job with the new bathrooms, and that's a plus.

Overall, the staff there seems to be trying to rise above the fact they work at a Wal-Mart and is much friendlier and more professional then they were in the past.It's Walmart. I enjoy te sceneryFrom the variants of burritos, we had the bueno breakfast (the kitchen sink) and green burro.  The bueno is everything -- ham, bacon, cheese, etc etc... well wrap it up in a burro, and its exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Wasn't wow'd but it was huge, and we cooked the leftovers with eggs and grits the next day (yeah Denny's style).  The green burro was better, chunky pork but I prefer Hatch green sauce for its smokiness which this didn't have.

The comp salsa and chips is tasty, and for fellow cilantro haters, the radar didn't go off!  The wait is looooong, so pickup an empanada to snack on while you do... the to-go area was full by the time we left, just waiting and waiting.  Friendly staff!They don't have the most widest selection of items and some things are overpriced, but with pawn shops it is always a hit and miss. It is a small store but they have a variety of things that most pawn shops have. They do have a pretty good jewelry selection, not extensive but it seems like they take in quality items. It is usually pretty busy but they have enough staff to get you out of there in a decent amount of time. It's like my mom always says:  I wouldn't hit a dog in the *** with it.We have been going to Kokopelli Winery for years--mainly because of their Fruited Chicken Salad with Mimosa dressing, which I often told people was my favorite salad of all time.  However, Kokopelli Winery suffers from a high turn over rate and many inconsistencies which is not only frustrating, but will more than likely, cause this restaurant to close.  When we first started going to Kokopelli, their prices were reasonable and their choice of ingredients was good--fresh spring mix and chicken for the salad and a generous portion of Mimosa dressing.  But then things started to go downhill.  The owners (or the chef) decided to use cheap iceberg lettuce, and recently have now switched to cheap spinach leaves with stalks that you could choke on.  They are also inconsistent with the type of bread they serve (sometimes good, sometimes stale), I have had bones in my chicken salad, the presentation is not consistent, they have cut back on the salad dressing and on top of all that, have raised their prices.  If you charge me $11 for a salad, you had better be using the best ingredients and offer a generous portion to boot -not cut corners so you can make more money.  I never thought I would say this, but I don't think we will be back.  As a previous poster stated, this place has potential, but you can't continue to be inconsistent in food and service and expect to survive.Getting long in the tooth.  Historic main building.  Pool deck is starting to show wear and tear.  Exterior room entry but it is Phoenix.  Room s were nice.  Well appointed and clean.,

The general condition is startingto show wear out side.

Did not golf.....why would I?Tried this place awhile back and it didn't have anything really that was memorable. Everything seemed just ok. I had a Denver omelet with hashbrowns and toast. My husband had some kind of spanish omelet with biscuits and gravy as his side and english muffin. The waitress brought me the wrong meal but quickly corrected it. However, she really didnt seem very friendly throughout the entire meal. Anyways, like I said, my meal was ok and the hubby said his was ok as well but did say that the gravy tasted canned. The prices were reasonable and their menu had alot of choices. Because of this, I would go again and just try something else and I would go later in the afternoon as it seems like there would be a wait by going earlier. Hope to be able to write a more positive update about this place in the future as it seems to be a hit with many other people.Pretty good food for the price, tons of potatoes with the country fried steak. Couldn't finish it.So yes...it was "A-OK."  It wasn't great...I don't think it came even close to the hype.  It wasn't bad...it just wasn't great.

The table shared a couple of Caprese Salad's...there was one single leaf of basil in the center of the plate.  The tomato's were dark pink (if we can get bright red tomato's in Minneapolis in the winter, why can't they get ripe tomato's in Chandler?).  Again...it was ok, but I expected more.

I had a "primevera" salad that was comprised of mixed greens, apples, orange, and grapefruit with a creamy raspberry dressing, but it was saturated in blue cheese crumbles that completely overtook the salad.  

My entree was a broiled halibut and came with a generous portion of mixed vegetables that were overcooked.  The halibut was simple and tasty, but it was also tiny - probably the smallest portion of halibut I've ever been served.

I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir; the only one they served by the glass on the menu.

So, all in all...it was ok.  I wouldn't even think of driving out of my way to go there again though.This sonic wasn't too far from my mother's in chandler so I came here a few times for cold drinks to get me thru the heat.  Both their flavored lemonades and ice cream drinks were excellent!I obviously can only give a Domino's a 3 star rating or else what would you think of me? but seriously Domino's is at least edible after decades of being part of the box it was delivered in. The cheese is stringy and tastes like real cheese, and the sauce actually tastes pretty good. Overall, I will at least consider Domino's for pizza when I want something quick and in a hurry.My friend Mario likes to meet here for breakfast, because we can just sit and talk.  I've been here twice, both on a Saturday morning around 8:30am.  The wait staff is friendly.

The breakfast is OK.  My wife keeps asking me to take her here, and one of these days, I'm gonna do it.

On my last visit, I ordered me some blueberry pancakes.  They were very large and I couldn't finish.  I thought I caught Mario staring longingly at the leftovers on my plate, until I realized he was just being transported back in time as he told a story of his childhood.

The food is plausible, but I'm partial to the atmosphere.  Que Dios Te Bendiga.I didn't have an outstanding experience in this place.

Breakfast was typical and service was rushy.  

Solid 3 stars

Biscuits were yumGood pizza not the best! But goodI have to say that I've given this place three tries.  I finally got served and had a chance to taste the food, and I am writing this review after three attempts.  The first time I came here, I was confused by the many entrances (go ahead and laugh, but I mean it!), and I don't like that when I enter a restaurant for the first time.  Then when I found out that there are no waiters bringing food to you, I promptly left, as I was simply not in the mood that day, as I was entertaining an out-of-town guest.  On my second visit, I arrived 30 minutes before closing and placed an order with my boyfriend.  Neither of us had cash, so we were both very embarassed at the front of the long line.  Instead of using the ATM (which my boyfriend refused to use out of principal), we left and were told they would be closed by the time we were back, so our order was cancelled.  Finally, we made it back this past weekend for food!  I had a fish taco and a corn quesadilla with green chiles.   I would not get the quesadilla again as there was not enough cheese.  The fish taco was good, but not good enough for me to come back here over Filiberto's or El Taco de Chandler.  I find the ambience to be very cool; I like the beach thing going on.  However, I find the service to be disappointing, especially the lack of waiters, the cash-only policy, and the hours of operation.  I like my food available later than 9pm sometimes, so establishments like this simply will not do.  I haven't totally written it off; I may come back on a hot day for a Corona and a fish taco on the sand.  But more than likely, I'll choose one of the competitors instead.This is one of my favourite taco joints in the Valley.  I used to live in Chandler and came here often. Recently I stopped by for the first time in 12 years and nothing changed.  The place looked exactly the same and food tasted the same. 

I must say that I nearly always applaud consistency in dining.  

The tacos here are great.  The food is fresh and tastes homemade.  They have a fix-in area by the counter that provide salsa and other condiments.  

The portions are good, not great for the money.  I usually spend about $8 to $10 for a meal, but am not always full afterward.  

They offer lunch specials between 11 a.m. And 3 p.m. during the week.  Otherwise the menu is ala carte.

The Mexican cantina environment is ideal and creates an authentic beach like atmosphere.

The staff is friendly and you can usually find a table.
 
Overall Guedo's is one of my favourite places in the Valley.

Revised: 12/12/12

I must say that my last view visits have been a turn off.  The portions get smaller and for the money it is simply not worth it.  I like to pay with credit card when I am able to do so.  Each time I pay for my meal I am asked if I can pay in cash.  The answer is simple - no.  I am overpaying for my meal and the interchange fee should not be over 2%.

I enjoy the food, but not the hassle...........I just finished my take out and here I am. I have dined there once before a year ago. I remember sitting there with my boyfriend. There were a bunch of young adults horsing around. The service was horrible and very distracting. One of the employees was sitting in the middle of the room (it's not very big in there) with her laptop stacking poker pieces. Another staff member knocked them over while bumping into the table. They argued over who was going to pick them up. So tonight we did take out. The food is great. We placed the order and it was ready in 15 minutes. Upon arrival I am greeted by a young lady who is on her laptop who does not bother to  look at me. Then an older female looked at me. I told her I was in to pick up an order. She asked what I ordered. As I list of my items: curry shrimp, beef and broccoli, and house fried rice, she rings up my bill and hands me my food. Overall, the food was good. The vegetables could be cooked a little longer. Service needs improvement. The room has some tables but people rarely dine there. There is a table in the front with healthcare items and supplements. That really threw me off. For a second I thought I walked into my gym.They changed their system so u can wash with just $1. It gives u 2:40 secs HOWEVER it took about 30 sec for my sprayer to update each selection change so I ended up putting 5 quarters in cuz I didn't notice that at first. Plan according I guess.  
All in all it's OK. I've washed my car here before and there was more water pressure. Normally the pressure from the sprayer pretty much cleans the car and takes everything off without me having to you the scrub brush or anything else... Not this time, due to the low pressure I had to use my hands to get basic dirt loose :/  Not sure the low water is a fluke or part of their new system.  One thing I do like about this place is that it has a "shampooer" for your carpets if u don't have your own.  I'll probably try again with thefirst.  They also have auto washes for $5 pressure and see what happens.Went out tonight for some Karaoke with my husband and friends.  This place isn't far from home but not easy to find.  It's located on Elliot and not Arizona Ave.  First time we drove right past it.  

The place is set up awkwardly and if you have any fat on you the booths are uncomfortable to sit in.  The waitresses were good.  I believe I saw a total of three of them to run two rooms.  That's a lot of area to cover for just three people, especially on a busy Saturday night. 

I tried the Philly Cheese steak and well it was very well made and very tasty for bar food.  The fries were over cooked and the drinks are small.  I had a margarita too and it was very good.  

I gave The Dirty Drummer three stars because I had an okay experience there but my sandwich was made just the way I like them.  I could have easily eaten another one but thought better of it. 

I believe if they rearranged the place and put a little work into it they could be a lot better then they are now.I'm one of THOSE people... I absolutely despise cilantro... I believe man found a weed in the ground and accidentally ate it, and hence we have cilantro.  That said..

Fish taco:  grilled fish, not deep fried.  Way OD on the salt (I swear I was crunching on salt flakes) but let's say that's a fluke and order it again.  No cilantro sighting.

Red burro + mini green burro:  liked the mini burro concept, while BF got the full sized.  BF is a red burro fiend and this makes it into this Top 5.  My mini green was passed to him, as there is an embedded cilantro taste... to be fair the meat was tender and juicy (not over cooked meat til it's dry and redunked in liquid). 

Rice & beans:  disturbing to see orange oil pool around the beans.  Flavors of either did not impress.

Really liked the tortillas, warm with just the right amt of chew.The food was pretty good and very inexpensive. The only negative to our experience isthat they don't have highchairs... Only place I've been to with no highchairs.This place is quick and cheap. So I am all for that. 
There really isn't a good taco Tuesday special, which I was looking for. 

The tacos were decent and the burrito was decent. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was all good. Good ingredients, made fresh, and way better than taco bell or filabertos.I love Starbucks and love how convenient this location is reference to my house. The recent remodel is impressive as well. The staff on the other hand seem less than the Starbucks standard I'm come to know and love. I have put off posting this review in order to give them additional chances for redemption but this morning was the last straw. My order was done incorrectly and the staff was less than bubbly. It seems as though it was a busy stressful morning but I have my past experiences to back that this is the norm. Finally yesterday when I went in I could hardly communicate my drink order  because the two baristas were giggling non stop at each other and couldn't contain themselves.Great customer service.I give them a 3 star rating because the food was good but we ordered 2 juices and the waitress never asked what size we wanted and automatically poured us the large. The prices are small $2.00, medium $3.00, and large $5.00. I have to say that paying more than $3.00 for any juice is outrageous and price gouging in my opinion. We told the waitress that we wanted small juices when we realized what the prices were and we saw her take the large back to the kitchen. The small juices were not much larger than a shot glass anyhow. I know this is a profit area and I get that, but $5.00 for a small water glass size juice is outrageous.

Food was hot and fresh and the service was great otherwise. They used to give all tables a pitcher of ice water in the Mesa location we used to frequent. I don't know if they stopped doing that but we did have to ask for ice water.Bagel alone, this place is a solid 4 stars. Entire experience not so much. Girl behind the counter put gloves on but then touched her hair, her face, scratched her ear, pulled up her pants... Then she realized that I was staring at her and changed her gloves. During that 45 seconds she asked me three times if I wanted the bagel toasted. The place could definitely use a good cleaning. Windows are foggy looking with streaks and dirt, dust behind the fridge area is very obviously not a concern, menu board looks neglected. If I wasn't such a sucker for bagels I would probably drive else where to get breakfast on my way to work. Too bad there isn't any where else to get a bagel between my house and work :/Their commercials are everywhere, but I had to go to Arizona to actually try some.

It's not bad, but it wasn't that great either. I got the #5: a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster with tots and a drink ($6.29). The burger was alright. The tots seemed a bit dry.

Are we supposed to tip the waiters that rollerblade to your car window?? I think that was the first time I ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurant.Please don't go by my rating as I have not ben there. I was looking for reviews on eyelash extensions and did not find any. Scary there are a lot of bad reviews and my eyes are pretty important. No room for errorI feel terrible needing to leave this update but it has to be done - 5 star for the Skin Care services- Brooke is awesome- get a facial and brow shape from her!
for the nail services 1 star. I made an appointment weeks ahead of time, and still wasted 2 hours at this place. I did end up getting my pedicure which was done really nicely but the whole experience felt cramped and uncomfortable. I felt like I was in the way. I had to have my gel mani done at the make-up table because there was no mani table available. Lisa, my nail tech recommended a color for gels, turns out it wasn't a color, it was clear. I wanted an opaque, matte, very light color, but they did not have anything other than glitters, bright colors and reds. I think every nail salon should have something more subdued as an option. I proceeded to feel even more uncomfortable when we tried to call the manager and it was done on someone's cellphone which had no service. I could have stepped outside I guess to use the cellphone but it was freezing out and really I just wanted to get out of there. Lisa was really trying her best with what they had and I felt terrible because she really tried so hard and was nice and didn't make me pay for any of the services. After leaving I went somewhere else to have my mani done because lisa soaked and scratched off the clear gel polish and my nails were left scratched and pretty damaged. lisa really tried so hard and if circumstance was different i'm sure it would have looked great.

The nail techs need a better space and more variety in color options for your guests. Also work on your scheduling because it really felt my time was not respected. I wasted 2 hours there and left with only a pedicure and an unfortunate attempt at a manicure. As of right now, still waiting for you to figure it out on nail services but definitely plan on coming back again to see Brooke for a facial.Here's a hint - when the restaurant says "breakfast" in the name, you should probably order breakfast! We went here for lunch last week, and I just wasn't in the mood for an omelet or anything heavy. I ordered soup and salad, and it was okay....but that's my fault for ordering a Cobb salad at a breakfast joint. My brother, however, ordered the pancakes, bacon and hash browns, and they were delicious. All of the omelets that came out looked really good, so I am dying to try one. This place always appears to have a wait on weekends, but we were seated immediately at lunch time mid-week. The service was decent, and the place was clean. Parking is slightly annoying, but we were lucky enough to find a spot in the parking lot immediately behind the restaurant.

I'd definitely go back and try it again for breakfast...or I'd order the grilled cheese, which looked divine.I used to come here all the time for breakfast.  I must say that I was never disappointed.  I really like their eggs Benedict and their jalapeno biscuits and gravy.  Their coffee was great too.  Today I came for lunch with some co-workers and had the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was very good with fontina and cheddar cheeses between to thick pieces of sourdough bread.  The tomato soup I could tell was homemade, but it was lacking in something for me... I think it needed to be a little thicker maybe with some croutons or something.An okay breakfast spot.

The good news? If you're staying at the W Scottsdale you can walk here, it's only a block away. Oh and the W has no other breakfast options unless you feel like eating at Sushi Roku, yuck.

The bad news? You'll likely have a bit of a wait and as far as breakfast places go, it's not that remarkable. Sure the eggs and bacon were fine, but nothing about this place says: kick ass breakfast. 

My friend and I were seated at the communal table. There was another random group of 2 seated at the other end. Two of my other friends tried to join us mid-meal (there were plenty of seats at the communal table) and were denied. The hostess said something about us dominating the communal table, not sure what that was supposed to mean but it sure was annoying.Typical Scottsdale! 

It felt a bit pricy, long wait to get a table, and just did not come through on the expectations.

The ambiance was nice and cozy for a breakfast nook but after the long wait in line my pancakes were not up to par and the coffee was burnt.

Although, I would recommend it for tourist because of the location. It's good, just not great.The food was good, but the coffee was horrible. I got the loaded breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, and fruit). Good portion and decent price, but, if you like coffee, this isn't the place to go.This is a gorgeous and well maintained Spring Training facility for the San Francisco Giants. At high noon, the sun faces left center and gets pretty brutal. I sat right of center, just a tad over from the Giants bullpen, and it was still burning hot - apply sunscreen liberally and stay hydrated. Vendors for beer and lemonade came around every inning for us grass people. Speaking of the grass too....bring a waterproof blanket? Everyone that sat in the grass got up with a wet spot of shame on their behind - pretty hilarious. 

Prices were a little higher at Scottsdale compared to other stadiums (boo), so we were pretty conservative on spending. If you can wait it out, Scottsdale has a fair amount of restaurants right outside the ballpark...but better yet, come prepared with some food of your own.

If you are looking to get autographs, come early....but even still, the Giants weren't very autograph friendly. Hector Sanchez spent upwards of half an hour signing just over the dugout. And Brandon Belt signed for all of 5 minutes just farther down the line. It looked especially bad considering the Royals had 5-6 players at once signing...come on, can't be outdone at your own park!
 
As for parking, check out the Scottsdale Civic Center Parking Garage - scored free parking there, woot! I was kind of nervous approaching the park when I saw a bunch of people offering their driveways for $15-20. But that might be for the later people.

Still a pretty fun experience overall.I think this establishment is riding the center line, meaning, middle of the road.  The atmosphere is not fussy, but not necessarily appealing, the food is good quality, but nothing that I could not make at home (if I were so inclined), the prices are fair, could be better, could be worse, and the service was also fair: efficient, but not friendly.  If this company were aiming for average, then it has achieved it.  But if I were a business owner, I would want to be known for, be special for..........SOMETHING!

I have to admit, I think the idea of buying a picnic lunch that comes with a picnic basket (for a rental fee) is a cool idea, but will I even remember this place after I leave when the rest of my experience was so very average?Call me weird, but I have an issue with long toe nails. It weirds me out. So when I went in for a pedicure appointment with DeAnna and was hoping for some minx, which looks better on long toe nails, she was up front with me and let me do a custom glitter bling job instead. Not only did she mix up a glitter just for me (I'm sure the color isn't hard to guess), but she gave me the extra to use at home!!!

Great service and such an adorable place, Downtown Scottsdale Hair & Nails will definitely pamper you and make you feel at home!!Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so "mixed"... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is "lively".

So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!This is basically a happy hour bar, and quite a good one. Cheerful; service & reasonable prices, with an open air atmosphere. Mexican style food - we had nachos & a fish taco & both were just fine. Pacifico bottles were $2 each. Not bad.This place was recommended by one of my friend's friend.  The moment I entered this place, I noticed this was unique for me because everything is all outdoor.  As a person from the San Francisco Bay Area, we don't have places like this because of the weather.  There were heated lights, but I believe that's unnecessary especially with the warm Arizona nights approaching.   Maybe for the Winter season. 

The food was very good.  We started with chips and salsa and their nachos.  The salsa was full of flavor and they taste a lot better than Salty Senorita.  My wife and I ordered the the six pack Dos XX fish tacos and they were very good, which you can't go wrong because its just beer battered fish.  They definitely taste a lot better than Rubios that's for sure.    

They have live music Friday night and a huge Jenga block for anyone who wants to play.  

The waitstaff was friendly and they checked back at us here and there.  This place is definitely leaning towards a younger crowd, but it's a fun place to be.  Dos Gringos is a nice place for lunch and is great if you have a large group for dinner and drinks.  However, I do not recommend this place if you have young children because some of the signage that is posted on the wall and below the bar counters.  Some of the signage is inappropriate for young kids to read. 

The prices are moderate, which is usually just right for Tex-Mex.  Furthermore, the drinks are inexpensive and you can play Jenga.  If you're in Scottsdale, then I recommend this place especially you have a group of friends with you.   You can't go wrong.Great restaurant. Went here for breakfast after a long hike on Camelback, I believe I got a veggie hash. It was pretty good, though nothing stellar. The toasted olive bread it came with (you get a choice, and I chose olive bread), was very good, really enjoyed that. My friend got their jalapeno pecan pancakes, and I had a bight of that, and thought it was pretty amazing. Really liked the contrast of spicy and sweet.
Service was good, everyone was friendly and as fast as could be expected for a busy Saturday morning. Atmosphere was nice, and overall the establishment was comfortable, clean and inviting.

I would definitely go again, as I would be curious to try some other items on their menu, but at the same time there are other breakfast places I love and would choose to go to. So we'll see.Patty, my shepard mix, liked the place ok. It was tucked away in a shopping center and limited in space. There were unusual beer and cocktails available for brunch, but it was not eye popping. Brunch was really good and tasty but a bit expensive.Thanks OJTable.Good food but awful service. Hostess was friendly and the monkey cakes were awesome. Bloody Mary's were really good but it took 30 minutes for our food and thats unreasonable for breakfast.I will do this in two parts. I have had drinks here several times. It is always the live music that draws me in off the streets. I just hear that guitar twang and suddenly I am whooping along with the rest of them. Being a western themed bar in Olde Town, you are going to get your share of photo snapping tourists. But the service is good and the beer is cold Happy Hour runs a buck above par. But I love live music. And this is the kind of place that you can gaze around and see something different each time. And the barstools shaped as chubby cheerleader asses never get old. I have never hit the place at lunch hour, but I will update when I do. Gotta try those Buzzard Wings they sell up. Food only serves until 4. Remember that. But so many choices nearby if you miss it. They sell great Scottsdale Tees and Hoodies, too. For the holiday giving time. I like to remind mom that I am having fun living here in the desert, Happy Hour fun.Midnight on a Friday night and this place was slammed. Might have been overflow from the nearby bars because it was wall-to-wall crowds at the inside register and on the patio wrapping around towards the back. My first impression formed based on the number of patrons who appeared middle eastern. The group sitting on patio to our left were speaking Greek. So, perhaps the food and the hookah reflected the same authenticity?

The food was OK. We split the regular hummus that came with assorted pita bread and veggies. It tasted average store-bought. Though it didn't knock our socks off, hummus is a wonderful (healthier) alternative to your standard late night drunken, fourth-meal, Scottsdale snack. My friend ordered a regular gyro and fries. It looked pretty good and the fries were also average tasting.

We ordered the blue mist hookah flavor and a round of Coors Light. The beers came in bottles - I think draft would be a nice touch. The hookah flavor was great and had a solid kick. I was impressed by how long it lasted between 3 people. We noticed the hookah lacked a good clearing mechanism, so the smoke turned stale towards the end. The hoses had a fancy looking mouthpiece to them that we all enjoyed.

Overall, I recommend Pita House as a hookah patio. There aren't many in the area, especially ones within decent walking distance to bars and restaurants. I've heard Oasis is good too. If you're looking for Greek or Mediterranean food, it's not top notch, but it may be one of few options nearby. It's a great fall-back and easy-to-spot location when you need it.While in Scottsdale we ate at Kona Grill. I had a puckery Grape Cosmopolitan, a nice Merlot to go with my 12 oz NY steak. It was good. Not great just good. The atmosphere was clubby on the exterior, inside was nice. Would I go again? Probably not. There are so many places to try and Kona did not make a big impression on me.Alison B. and I met here for reverse happy hour last week.  Before we decided to move to the patio (it was too noisy earlier), she ordered a peach martini made w/ sake, and I a glass of Red Diamond Merlot.  Alison was feeling like having the Kona calamari (HH price $5).  It's been years since I had KG's and I couldn't recall if I liked it, but I mentioned that if we moved to the bar or patio, that happy hour would start in fifteen minutes and we could order that and something else at happy hour prices!  It took a little arm-twisting, but Alison relented ;)  

Why did I stay away for so long?!  Oh yeah, I remember now... Mom and I used to frequent Chandler's KG our first two years in the valley, but it just got harder and harder to find an empty table at the bar/patio, plus it was always so noisy!  I really like Scottsdale's location- not too noisy outside, especially if you're lucky enough to snap up a table at a corner or at the outer edges.

Besides the calamari, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA#v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA
 we also tried the Five-spice Barbecue Chicken pizza ($5), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng#yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng
 and she ordered a Bud-light ($2) and I a glass of House red merlot ($4).  Food and libations were delish!Pet peeves of mine include expensive sushi that doesn't wow me, oh, and snobs. The customers who drive up in their super expensive cars and think this place is the s***? Hmm.. doesn't impress me. That's Scottsdale for ya.

I do have to admit that the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon was pretty good (shrimp and pork fried rice, with veggies), but the California rolls were just meager and overpriced. Kris had the pad thai noodles, which he says was pretty tasty. Very white-washed, don't expect any type of authentic asian food. I believe I said this place is like a P.F. Chang's, but Japanese style.Got into AZ and needed to grab a few drinks and some food before heading out to the party scene so my friends decided to try the Kona Grill. We got there in time for their reverse happy hour... which I was really excited for. The 3 of us ordered the margarita flatbread, potstickers, voodoo roll, spicy shrimp roll, lettuce cup and avocado eggrolls along  w 2 rounds of drinks and the bill only came out to be $50! Super cheap!...which usually equates to awesomenesss... right?

Wronnng.. we definitely got what we paid for.. the drinks were weak and the food wasn't particularly tasty  with the exception of their avocado eggrolls& margarita flatbread... everything else was subpar. 

Nevertheless, the service was good, atmosphere was nice and parking was abundant (=We hadn't been here in a while. After shopping, we decided to have an early dinner. I order the Pad Thai and my wife had the Maui Tacos. 
For me, since the Maui Tacos aren't on the menu, the way they were made looked much more different than when they were on the menu. The fried rice looked wet  and the tacos weren't wrapped as nice. But my wife still loved it.
My Pad Thai was filled with a lot of chicken and shrimp. The chicken meat was cut is large chunks. Overall, I would rate this entree a B.
Our lemonade was really watered down. I let mine set for about 10 minutes before drinking it. I should have asked for another one, but I was almost done with my meal and had been drinking water.
The server, Diane, was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our glasses were filled with water.Overall good experience dining here. Great HH that's worth trying out, especially the calamari. Really love the huge saltwater tank they had, just wish a few employees would have known the type of fish in it!Confession: I go to Victoria's Secret exactly twice a year, for the sales. So I shouldn't be surprised when it's mayhem, should I? You'd think after a while I'd learn to go when things are normal prices and enjoy the peace and quiet, but nooooo. In my defense, once I get home with all my sale goodies, it was totally worth it, it's just in the moment that it seems like a bad idea. The staff are always stressed out during sale season, I feel bad asking them to find me all the different sizes and everything, and some of the other customers can be so rude! I almost got knocked over by this chick in three-inch stilettos with a serious weave. So do as I say, kids, and not as I do, but this year I'm resolved to come in with those coupons they send you at an OFF-sale time and actually have myself a pleasant shopping experience. Plus they might actually have everything I want in stock.A group of friends and I tried here too on Saturday.  The margaritas were fantastic, but the food was so-so for everyone at the table.  The setting is really unique and fun to hang around.  I would go to the Tortilla Factory again...as long as we were just going for drinks and atmosphere - not for food.After reading about this restaurant featured in a Phoenix Travel magazine for its patio dining, my hubby & I decided to give it a shot.  The wait was long, the servers were nice, the place was super busy and the patio was beautiful  (Minus the really cheap plastic patio chairs).

It was nice to wander the local art galleries during our wait time.

Food was decent.  I have no complaints, but I found myself wondering if any of the other patios that we'd past, may have had better more unforgettable foods on the menu.  Oh well.

P.S.  I didn't realize they were going to automatically bring tortillas to the table so I made the mistake of ordering chips & salsa.  NOT necessary unless you want to stuff yourself before your meal :)The food, service, and atmosphere are great, but for the money you can get better elsewhere.  It is a good "first date" place or anniversary meal place when you want to talk during your meal - nice and quiet.  I'll probably go back but not frequently.

Try a Tequila Flight!  Very educational and a nice way to sample several tequilas and not get plastered.

They could put just a little pizazz into this place and make it really neat - a "must do" activity.To put it straight, our server was awkward. We were a group of four chicks, so I'm not sure if he was nervous or what... but there was some definite strangeness going on.

The crab dip is pretty bomb if you like big chunks of avocado... Which I do... Mmmmm.. Also had the green Chile enchilada is super delish. Supposedly it's a spicy dish but I'm super anti-spice and I didn't notice it.

The super awesome bigass patio is pretty cool, especially with all the romantic lighting. This COULD potentially be an excellent spot to just chill and have a drink with your buds, but we were surprised to be told at 10pm that it was time to close down shop. :PFood = Great
Atmosphere = Great
Service = So So

We were told we had an hour wait and went to the bar for drinks and appetizers. Waited 15 minutes to get acknowledged. We finally got to order (had to pay for chips & salsa?!?) and just got our drinks when our table was suddenly ready, which was a nice surprise.  Once seated we had pretty decent service and the food was great.  Wouldn't recommend during Spring Training season or on a busy night but would on a slower night.As much as I respect Michael C.'s reviews, I'm not going to give Grazie 4 - 5 stars just because.  The last time my wife and I visited Grazie, we received terrible, unattentive service, and a soggy, less-than-tasty Margherita pizza.  And I'm not trying to exaggerate either - we actually wanted to send the pizza back.

I love the idea of a small, nearby, locally owned pizzeria like Grazie, so we'll probably try going there again.  The atmosphere is just what I want a dinner place - dark and intimate - but they have to have good food and service, too.Interesting bruchetta platter, nice selection of toppings for pizzas and decent wine list.  Walked right in on a Friday night.This was one of the many stops on the UYE Ugly Sweater party.  This was the only stop I made that night, I know I'm totally lame.  I have to say, this was the perfect atmosphere for the event.  The tacky decor complemented our fine yelepers fabulously horrid christmas sweaters beautifully.  The drinks were inexpensive and we got what we ordered, which is all I really ask for.I have been here several times and honestly, this place kind of gives me the hebejebes. It just seems dirty and messy to me. A stark comparison to many Old Town bars you will go to, so at least you can dress down a bit when playing your life-sized Jenga game. Which, by the way, was awesome. Life sized plinko looked fun, and the ring toss thing was fun too. A nice addition to Old Town, again, because it is different from other bars.They say you have to "dig your Golf game out of the dirt"...you have to "Play golf from the bottom of your feet up"...the most important distance in golf "is the 6 inches between your ears"...you should never "putt from the rough"...never mind that last...not great advice:)

It has been a rough week and I decided that I needed to swing a golf club again...just to put a little good feeling in my head...a round of golf, well played, always put me in that "I'm the king of the world" kind of mode:)

One minor problem...I looked at my calendar and I hadn't actually swung a club in almost 6 months...that's a recipe for an unpleasant round of golf...what to do?...what.to.do? :-)

Well, I guess a little practice wouldn't hurt...I mean if it's good enough for Tiger, it's good enough for me:)

And speaking of Tiger...it looks like we are both on the comeback trail right now...although my trail seems somewhat less problematic...I mean when I tee off, no one is going to be ironically shouting "It's in the hole"...BTW, I think we've just seen the tip of the iceberg with Tiger's story (although I understand that he seldom used just the tip of the old "Tiger-berg":)

But, sadly, we'll never really know...

What I do really know is that I'm glad I have this little (and I do mean little...the practice facility at Whisper Rock is the size of 3 full golf holes at CGC) facility to start to tune up my game:)

I don't really play golf at CGC (although I would ...it's "cute" and little...it would be good short game practice).

But for me, it's the closest practice range (to my place), it's inexpensive (I bought a $100 range card and that gives me something like 17,000 golf balls to hit:), people are friendly there, they don't mind me bringing my shag bag over and using my own golf balls for some of my practice...in short, it's homely, but it's homey:)

They even have a little practice bunker...a sort of flat (but OK) short game practice area...and real grass on the range itself...an important feature, from my perspective:)

I don't know about you, but I don't like hitting off mats...you can't learn anything about your game hitting off mats...there's no "feedback" to tell you some of the things that you really need to know about your game:)

I mean try to hit a "fat" shot off a mat...go ahead, I'll wait...that's what I thought...can't be done...not even a shot that's just "chubby"...the club just bounces off the mat and into the back of the ball.

Anyway, I went over and hit about 100 balls today and rolled about 100 putts and you know what...after the first half dozen whizzer's, the ball started coming off the club the way the laws of physics insist it should...high, soft draws that hang up there forever...towering cuts that stop on a dime...the ball going where I thought it should:)

Am I ready to take my game back to the course?...no flippin' way:)

I need a lot more practice before I tee it up again...at least if I'm going to tee it up for money:-)Great atmosphere and food, but our lunch (two salads and a roasted chicken sandwich) took almost two hours. They didn't seem to care either, I'm just sayin.3.5 stars. 

We decided to check this place out after all the waves. The space and decor is nice and cute, and girly! We arrived at 10:30 for a Sunday brunch, and there were plentiful of empty seats for us to choose. Nice patio, too!

I had the French Toast with fresh strawberries and chicken apple sausage (however, the menu says with raspberry, I didn't really care for either one, meh~) The toasts were thick and soft, but weren't that outstanding. I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand, they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind. Friend had the Spinach and Tomato Omelette with feta cheese. I didn't take a bite, but she really enjoyed it. It came with a side of potatoes and fresh fruits.  

Our waitress was nice, but the service was slow... Overall we had a nice little trip. It's definitely a good spot for a girls' day out!I had the breakfast quesadilla. As far as quesadilla's go is was pretty good. I loved that combination, seasonal veggies, sausage, egg, cheese. They could be a little more generous with the protein, and most of the quacamole was turning brown (not exactly appetizing), but overall it was good. The salsa that it came with was the redeemed the old guacamole.

However, the person who served the guacamole could have been a little more sensible and not served brown guac. Instead, it looked like it was mixed in with the nice looking guacamole as if I wouldn't notice.Okay, so we had a rather large party of 13 of us, we were seated in the back in a cottage just for us. They do not have a children's menu but were willing to accommodate our 5 children with chicken and cheese quesdillas, which they all loved.....The organic strawberry and chicken salad with organic lettuce was really good, I had to ask for a side of bread which they graciously bought and had to get a side of white vinegar due to an allergy which they were okay with..  Some of the appetizers like the brie and apple could be a bit bigger along with the cheese plate wish that was a bit bigger - these two plates were not big at all and only enough for maybe 3 people.  The hummus which everyone usually likes was not a hit since they put pieces of cucumbers and tomatoes in them, not sure why....The service could have been a little better, as our glasses and drinks were not filled enough or often...We only have one waitress who was trying her best, as before they need more wait staff...Everyone enjoyed their food, I was disappointed in the fact that there salmon is not wild caught, rather they use farm raised Atlantic Salmon, which I do not understand why especially if they are about healthy organic food, farm raised salmon is filled with bacteria, chemicals and pesticides and can make you really sick, if you are used to organic food...Overall pretty good meal, it did not fill us up...as the portions are on the small side.....overall nice meal with family for a special occasion.  We would like to try their breakfast sometime to compare it.My mom and I have gone here for years to celebrate Mother's Day. I want to say I ADORE the atmosphere of Arcadia Farms. I want to live there. However, the last couple times we have gone, the food has been lacking. The chicken sandwich was bland, everything needed salt and the crab and avocado tower was not only bland and flavorless but extremely watery. We didn't finish it. Strawberry shortcake was delicious. We have decided to only go back for the ambiance and will have wine and cheese. Probably won't bother ordering additional food.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the atmosphere.We've been coming here annually for the last few years, and have enjoyed it over several comparable hotels in the area.  The kids love the pools and mini waterslide, tennis courts, and the rooms are very comfortable (the beds are some of the best I've slept in).  The past few visits, I've noticed that the hotel has cut back on staffing so that it is REALLY lean--some afternoons, there was no poolside service at all, and the water slide was just closed, for no reason.  Also, the kitchen staff seems to have suffered a bit--twice, they got my husband's order wrong and once, we waited over an hour for the food to arrive (and it was still wrong).  These may seem like small inconveniences but they're aggravating at a premium resort like this should be.Some friends and I recently spotted a deal on Expedia and decided to book a Scottsdale getaway at the Phoenician.

The grounds of the Phoenician are meticulously kept, and the staff is extremely warm and friendly.  The hotel layout is quite strange though, with many different wings to it and very odd placement of exits to the grounds, none of which are labeled.

While the decor is somewhat dated, overall the interior of the hotel is very well maintained and clean.  There are several shops and restaurants on the property, all operating on the premise that you never have to leave (and therefore spend all your money here)!  

Make no mistake,  this place will wipe you out if you let it.  A game of tennis cost us $50, not to mention the $20 pair of socks (I KNEW I forgot to pack something!).  A round of golf w/ rentals ran us $150 a person;  However, the desert course was beautiful and they do a fabulous job maintaining it, which ain't cheap.

On to restaurants.  Most of the spots had pretty good food.  All were incredibly overpriced.  The one exception was the poolside restaurant - In addition to being overpriced, the food there was disgusting!

With Old Town only 5 min away, I would suggest taking a car into town for dinner and checking out some of the fabulous restaurants there.  A towncar/cab ride should be $10-13 each way, so beware of un-metered cabs that will try to rip you off.  $15 max!!

All in all, the Phoenician is a very well-run resort with some great amenities and impressive golf courses.  However, if you are like me and your enjoyment is hampered by paranoia of being constantly ripped off, then you may not find it so relaxing.I have a few things to say about the Phoenician. Some good, some bad. Let's start with the good.

Rooms:
Spacious and well decorated. The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. 42" HD TV. Beautiful view of the resort grounds.

The Resort Grounds:
Meticulously taken care of. Grass is green. Pools and ponds are very well maintained. They have bocci ball and you can feed the Koi. (One caveat: wear a bathing suit when you feed the Koi. They are aggressive and will splash you in their excitement to get fed.)

The Staff:
Very attentive, polite, and polished. 

And now for the bad.

NO FREE WIFI. Seriously, name one hotel (or resort) that does not offer free wifi. Granted, you can go downstairs to their "internet cafe" and as long as you are in the boundaries of that room, you can use their wireless internet (I do believe they shape the network. Certain applications run slowly.) You can pay for wifi: $12.95 for 24 hours (1 mb up/1 mb down). What a ripoff. Wireless internet should be standard.

No in-room coffee maker. Again, name a hotel (or resort for that matter) that does not have a coffee maker in the room. Le sigh.

No free breakfast. Not even a continental breakfast. You know, semi-ripe fruit, day old danishes, orange juice. Nope, not at the Phoenician. They do brew complimentary Starbucks coffee but you have to pay $25 for the breakfast buffet. 

Overall, nice resort but the lack of free wifi will certainly make me think twice about staying here.This is an incredibly beautiful property, it is just huge.  It is built against a rocky hill and is surrounded by the golf course.  We stayed in one of the Casitas in the lower part of the property.  All day long starting at 5am there are buses, trucks and maintenance carts driving by.  The noise is deafening.  At no time during the day was it relaxing.  It also seems that they could cut there maintenance staff by at least 30%.  WHY do they need all those people that look like they are doing nothing except driving around being super loud!!  Now let's talk about how housekeeping yells to there fellow cleaners constantly throughout there cleaning effort, while one is downstairs the one upstairs is yelling for something, asking questions.  HEY!!  I am still in my room trying to sleep or work or rest!! SHUT UP!  Won't be back.  This is for conventions where the guests are gone all day or you are wasting your money.I love the intimacy of this small comedy room. And it's located in downtown Scottsdale, which is nice if you to dinner first and/or want to get drinks after the show. Although they don't showcases a lot of well-known names, the venue is still a great place to catch up-and-coming comics. They also do a killer open mic comedy night every Sunday. And the cover is affordable. They also offer discounts with your student I.D. and offer a half-price covers for ladies for the 10 p.m. show. Check www.thecomedyspot.net for more information.I think I came here on a bad night.  I really dug the decor & the more than ample wine list (of which I had a nice shiraz and my date had a nice cab).  from all angles, between the lounge area and the quiet dining tables, it's a really cool, quiet little place to take someone out.

we were promptly seated and took a few minutes to ponder the wine, which came out promptly, followed by some tasty bread, followed by ordering, followed by an extended conversation... hey... my wine is just about... empty... and... i still don't have food?   the waitress comes over & explains there's been a mixup in the kitchen, and that the food is on the house.  holy crap, it's been an hour since we sat down?  good thing this wasn't an awkward first date.  the food, also, was kinda lukewarm & not that great.  i had the steak (which comes out crusted with a peppercorn crusty thing and pre-sliced, which was a bit odd).  

i think i'll have to give this place another shot.Sugar high? Sugar coma? Sugar fix? Get all 3 at The Sugar Bowl.

I give Props to the concept, so add a star. 
I think it's over-hyped, so delete a star. 

In the end, this place cancels itself out. (Hence the 3 stars for "netural.") I'll explain.

The concept of an hometown ice cream parlor is applaud-able. The execution is great - everything is branded and consistent. The menu brags of wide variety, although if you don't know how to read the toppings, mixing and concoctions section, you may find yourself with a headache that's not from the sugar. So, it's best to go with somebody who's been before. I've only been twice. Each time I needed help reading the menu. Maybe that's my problem, though. See for yourself. 

So, once you select a fine sugary treat, you're ready to enjoy it. Yet, be forewarned. Don't order anything that's not in a bowl, for you'll get jipped on the portions. If you order a malt, it comes in a cool retro glass, but you'll be finished before you had a chance to unwrap your straw. Just like if you order the cheesecake, which is served on a plate. It's a tiny slice of cheesecake goodness, so don't get your hopes up. (Who really needs all that sugar anyway?)

TIP O FTHE DAY: Order whatever comes in a bowl.  (Hence the name, The Sugar Bowl.)

The portions are more than generous. I had one of the local favorites - apparently the one all baseball players and fans enjoy. It was just okay. I don't remember what it was called, but it's the vanilla ice cream served with a puff pastry. I asked for fresh strawberries on top. Yum. I was expecting the pastry to be warm, allowing the ice cream to melt and me to slip into Sugar Bliss. Instead, I needed a steak knife to slice off my bites. The pastry was frozen, like the ice cream. I was left wanting. (Not to mention I was the last one to finish, due to having to carve off each bite.)

This is a great spot to bring visitors, especially if they're younger than 10. You can't go wrong with patrons not old enough to tell the difference between a Sugar High and a Sugar Let Down.I grew up in Phoenix and my daddy took me to the Sugar Bowl for ice cream every few months or so, for years starting about age 5 when we first moved there and lived in a motel down the street for a while until we found a house.  

I loved pink as a girl and this place had that, in spades. 

I liked hot fudge sundaes. Dad used to say it wasn't as good at Mary Coyle's ( I don't know how to spell that) which closed for a while in the 70's I think,and then came back "wrong" ( like Buffy) , but it was a good runner up. 

I didn't care, it was ice cream, and it was good. Ice cream in Arizona is ESPECIALLY good. It's freaking hot there all the time, which makes you appreciate cold yumminess even more.

Maybe it's a little outdated, but it's still sweet.Nice prices and a clear niche. Just go here and get a nice big icecream. But to be picky I have had better ice cream hence only a 3The place has history but the ice cream and the service is nothing special. I give it three for the history. There ice cream is very below average compared to Churn, Melt, and other local places but I will say they have the best Patty Melts around. Yummy! The place is kind of run down and dirty these days as other Yelpers have mentioned.Pumpkin Spiced Latte has just changed my life.

This place gets odd waves of business - one second quiet then - BAM! - line out the door.  Staf is friendly and efficient - we all know what Starbucks sells so, yeah, they have that stuff too.I small group of us went here Saturday night.

It only took a couple of minutes for them to seat us in a nice area with couches and a table.  It was kinda like hanging out at home with friends except the wine selection is much better!

They do have a large number of wines by the glass.  I had a nice cab sauvignon.

I'd like to come back on a night when they have live music.A nice wine bar with an extensive wine list. 

This place is great if you want to drink wine, hang out and have a few light apps. However, a few of the staff members are rude... not very accomodating. Last time I went there, we walked in approx 10 mins before they opened (the door was not locked) and they told us to come back and wouldn't let us sit and hang out for 10 mins until they were 'officially' open.

Also, the interior is decorated similar to a wine cellar so it's dark with comfy chairs but there is a strange damp smell.Our server was great...very easy going yet professional. We chose Cowboy Ciao because of the Yelp reviews and it was close to the Fire Sky resort where we were staying. I can't say I was all 'that' excited about the food here. We ordered the Stetson Chopped Salad because it was supposed to be 'all that'. It was interesting and tasty, but not to die for. I wouldn't go back just to eat it. 

We also ordered teh Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry which is a Signiture Dish for Cowboy Ciao. It also was good but lacked the pow that we were expecting. 

For dessert we had the Bread Pudding which was decadent and amazing. I'd go back just for this. 

All in all it was a nice dinner, good food, great service, but not super dee duper. It deserves three stars in my book.I find Cowboy Ciao hit or miss.  It is a great concept (mixing Italian with southwestern cooking).  The first time I went, I had the Pig in Palenta and it was amazing!  The whole experience was enjoyable.  I have been there a few times since and the food and staff have been just so so.  The choped salad is consistently legit.  Everything else I've had have been hit or miss.I mostly enjoyed my meal at Cowboy Ciao. It started a bit rough. I made a Sunday evening reservation, to celebrate an anniversary. We were promptly seated, given a lunch and dinner menu. This led to confusion initially, then mild frustration when it took our server over 10 minutes to come see us. My date and I  decided on a Bottle of martinelli's cider, and a glass of champagne for her. I requested the champagne be poured in a red wine glass, because she'd be adding the cider to it. A bit of an unusual request, but far from difficult I thought. I also mentioned very clearly to the server that I was not drinking. AND I said, word for word while making eye contact, 'I don't drink'. He returned 10 minutes later with 2 empty red wine glasses. 5 minutes later he brought a flute with champagne, and a bottle of alcoholic cider. I poured some without looking closely, then caught the smell of alcohol. I flagged him down with some difficulty, and explained that he brought something other than what we ordered, and mentioned again that I don't drink, while pointing at the label showing '9% alcohol by volume'. He was completely confused. He said something like 'oh, I forgot to mention this alternative suggestion.' I then asked him to please bring the Martinelli's we ordered, and a second dinner menu (I had mentioned that problem earlier as well). 

He returned fairly promptly with the right bottle. The rest of the meal service was mostly uneventful, the server was semi awkward but attentive. He kept saying 'I just want to check with you that the (salad/appetizer/entree) is ok' . I had the lamb - very GOOD but not great, she had the pork chop -  GREAT. 

I don't see myself retuning, there are better options nearby. And please Cowboy Ciao, remind your staff that serving someone alcohol when they say they don't drink is uncomfortable. I think this was just a factor of him not listening, which is unpleasant.I've come to realize my reviews are getting too long and since I don't bother reading long reviews, I'll try and keep it shorter, but with enough details.

This place used to be all the rage back in the day and I always kind of thought it was overrated. Having gone again recently for a co-worker's birthday, I'd say it was a little better than I remember, but nothing crazy.

Server said the best thing on their lunch menu was the Reuben Wishes He Was This Cool. He said it was hands down the best. It wasn't though unfortunately. He even convinced the people in the group who don't even like Reubens to try it and all 4 of us were disappointed. The bread seemed stale and the meat was nothing crazy, just average at best.

A couple co-workers got the Corn Nuts About Scallops which was pretty awesome. I wish I had gotten that.

Bread Pudding was good. Definitely get it for dessert.

The Truffled Mac N Cheese was also great, but I'm a sucker for truffle anything.

Came here for brunch a while back and was unimpressed.

The place isn't terrible by any means, but it also isn't anything great. 3 stars seems fitting to me.The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  I have to agree with some of the other posts that it seemed that we were an inconvenience to the waiter and took a long time between ordering and getting our food.  We were there a total of 3 hours,  and most of that was waiting.  The food was Ok. I had the spare rib.  It was a little dry and the portion was a bit small for the price. The best part of the meal was the bread pudding dessert, it was fantastic.  Overall,  it was not a bad place,  but not sure I would return with choices that taste better for less money.We have been a fan of this place for years.  The food is always fantastic.  However, our last visit left a bad taste in my mouth.  There were 6 of us there entertaining out of country guests for work.  We ordered sparkling water and at the suggestion of our waitress ordered a few for the table to share.  Upon arrival of the bill we realized that they charged $15 per bottle of sparkling water!  Not cool!  Had we not been entertaining for work I would have said something on the spot to our waitress but didn't want to make a fuss.  I think it worth noting here so others aren't left to be as shocked as we were.I'm increasing the rating for this location because I've found an amazing salesperson in the dress department.  The men's department has been an enormous help with shopping quickly for my husband's items.

I still think the saleswomen on the second floor could use some training in tact and listening (as in, if I say I don't want sleeveless, stop trying to change my mind with 6 sleeveless options and find what I want), but alas, I have been spoiled by the Houston Galleria staff, who are, after all, amazing.

All in all, I increased the rating, but at the end of the day, I go to Nordstrom to shop for myself, and if the saleswomen in that section are below par, it just ruins the quality and image of the store overall.I am writing this review because of Salsa. Yes the pollo quesadilla is amazing. And the burro's are fantastic. There salsa though is out of this world; yes it is expensive, but for good reason. I use to be a regular here, kind of a creature of habit. My love for the spicy side of life was quenched here. There salsa is made with several exotic peppers that can only be found in Mexico. That is why it is over six dollars a pint. The rest of there food is amazing, but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven!What?! Outta red beef tamales? Bogus.

My first experience at El Molino was really not that bad. Wanted a late afternoon lunch/dinner so I made my way over. Tip: the nachos are huge and one order was enough to share between myself and my girl. We ordered them with ground beef, which was tasty with a bit of a kick. They were also loaded down pretty well with cheese, refried beans, tomatoes and bite-size cubes of potatoes.

In addition to the nachos, I wanted to know what their tamales were doing. Sadly, they were out of the red beef tamales so I got a green corn one just to see. Not so much, not for me, anyway. There wasn't much to it, just a thin layer of green chile inside along with sweet corn. My special lady friend seemed to like it just fine.

I'll probably go back because the nachos were tasty, but I'd have to drive right past the new 2 hippies taco location and that might prove to be a difficult task.Looking for quick, moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?

El Molino is your answer...

It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  I've had chips and salsa, guac, a chicken taco salad, and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.

Either way, El Molino is a step up from fast food but it's no frills.  Oh, and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)I wasn't very impressed with the food. Service was friendly.

Other reviews have summed it up pretty well.  Decent, reasonable, nothing exceptional.

Standard Mex, yo.Got a carne asada burrito and a side of beans.

Both were very good but the price is why I wouldn't recommend or go back. And the side of beans was only a half pint. You can get the same thing at Filberto's for almost half the price. Period. And, the carne asada at Filberto's has onions in it. :] 

If you're going to open a small non chain restaurant, you need to either somehow REALLY set yourself apart from other restaurants selling similar foods or the price needs to be roughly the same.

Filberto's on McClintock  & Guadalupe is probably at the very top of every mexican restaurant I've been to. Never been let down.Pretty big disappointment for me after all these great reviews praising pancakes of the Gods. Everything here seems pretty average to me, only slightly ahead the likes of Cracker Barrel. I compare it to Cracker Barrel not because it has a ton of crap all over the place and a tacky gift shop, but because the food is pretty flavorless except when they decide to heap on the sugar.

Had the famous apple pancake. Which does have a delicious apple cinnamon topping, but on top of a thick, spongy, bizarre apple pancake. I'm definitely not a fan of the pancake base and the whole thing made me OD on apples and sugar. I think it would be better just to have the spiced apples on the side of a dish.

The omelets are amazingly fluffy and flavorless. I had cheddar in my omelet, right?

For good measure, we ordered some coconut pancakes on the side with the omelet. Pretty average pancakes with a little bit of coconut mixed in and some intensely pineapple syrup. Again I ODed on pineapple without any good pancake substance.

I'm guessing the people who love this place are more into sugary toppings on their pancakes, while I am in it for the cake experience.

Coffee also tasted like it came from Denny's.

To aggravate the situation, this location has all the atmosphere of a Village Inn on sugar roids. Elderly patrons trying to clank there way through all the crowded tables with their walkers, angry Scottsdale douche bags yelling about how stupid it is for a restaurant to not take credit cards, church-goers sequestering large sections for a apple God chasers, and morbidly obese patrons with fashion statements like Tinkerbell sweat pants with a hot pink shirt and crocs and a rainbow Coach purse. It all just made me wish I went to the Good Egg at Park Central Mall instead. Would've cost less too.My realtor hooked us up to this restaurant last year.  We've had breakfast several times, and have always been pleased.  Pancakes Galore!  Check out their menu on the website http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/.

Service has always been good and the restaurant is clean.  Only downsides are parking is a pain in the ass as it is always busy, even during the week.  Also, no credit/debit cards.  Now I don't have a problem with that when prices are dirt cheap (check out Randy's Restaurant) as it does cost money to accept plastic.  But, this place isn't that cheap.  We're usually in for $25-$30 for breakfast for two including tip.  Luckily, there's an ATM right next to it if you forget.I have heard lots of rants and raves about the great pancakes at OHOP, which is located in the parking lot of the Motel 6 right by Neiman Marcus (I know...it is an odd block of Camelback Road). Parking is adequate...there were people waiting outside, yet my dining companion and I were able to get parking in the lot, and there is street parking if needed.

We were told that we would have a 20-25 minute wait and were given a ticket with a number. Our number was called about 10 minutes later and we were seated. We were accosted by what seemed like dozens of signs warning us that they don't accept credit cards for payment as we walked to our seats, so I made a mental note to go to the ATM located in the restaurant after placing our orders ($2.50 fee, and more ranting on this later).

The decor is indeed classic outdated breakfast chic. It looks like Mel's diner, but with tables much closer together. We ordered coffee and orange juice and sat down to look over the menu. They have a large variety of pancakes that vary in both batter type (buckwheat, potato, buttermilk, chocolate chip) and topping (banana, coconut, lignonberries). In addition they have a large selection of crepes and omlettes (the oms come with a short stack of buttermilk pancakes).

We received our coffee, which was of the standard generic diner variety, and placed our order. I ordered a short stack of the 49er flap jacks, described as plate-size, chewy, and tender, and added a a side order of potatoes. My friend ordered the "lacy" swedish pancakes, which come with lignonberries. He also ordered an english muffin on the side.

Our food arrived and the pancakes were great. My 49ers were chewy, almost creamy, and delicious. The texture and consistency was perfect, and they absorbed the butter and syrup perfectly. They were almost crepe-thin, but were not delicate. My companion spoke very highly of the swedish cakes as well. The potatoes were a nightmare though. In most breakfast situations, one expects a side order of potatoes to be cooked to order, served fresh off the griddle. That was not the case with these potatoes. They had the temperature and texture that indicates they had spent the better part of the morning drying out in a steam table. They were seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of onion and pepper tossed in, and I am sure they were delicious when they were cooked, but by the time they reached my table, they tasted like yesterday's leftovers reheated in a microwave.

The check arrived and the damage was $32. Keep in mind that this is not the place to go for a "bargain" breakfast. Our bill included the two pancake orders (mine was a short stack), a side of potatoes, an english muffin, 2 coffees, one juice, and an extra side of berries ($1.50). The pancakes are definitely worth the $7-9.25 that they charge, but there is no reason to go for the side dishes. In all honesty, I prefer the food and atmosphere at a place like Palette if I want a $32 breakfast. The pancakes here are something that I expect I will have a craving for again, though.

Service was friendly and prompt. Our drinks never went below half-full and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.

On to the Credit Card issue. I totally understand that businesses don't want to deal with the fees and hassle associated with accepting credit cards, but for a restaurant in a major tourist area where a meal for 2 costs more than $30, it seems silly and stubborn to refuse to accept credit cards. I can almost picture some crotchety, grumpy guy in the back boring his grandchildren with yet another diatribe about how the credit card companies are out to get him. My point is, If you are going to charge an upscale price, you need to accept credit card payment. period.

So overall, 3 stars. It would have been 4 stars had it not been for the steam-table potatoes and the annoyance of paying 2.50 to pay.The wife and I visited this establishment this past Sunday to compare it to the one we used to go to in Forest Park Illinois. I had read here on yelp about the long lines and indeed we ran into that when we arrived about noon on Sunday. There was a 20 minute wait and i was shocked to see this place so busy do to the fact that it is right next to a Motel 6. I say that because with the obvious patrons from the Motel i would think people would not come because they would have to "battle" with the Motel crowd.

When we were seated we got a very nice waitress, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered. I had the smoked turkey sausage with 2 eggs, 3 buttermilk pancakes, and hasbrowns. My wife had Pancakes with 2 eggs with chorizo sausage and hashbrowns. The FOOD is definitely the reason for the long lines people...trust me we were not disappointed at all with that. The service was outstanding as well and while it is a little more expensive than in Illinois the FOOD more than made up for it.

A personal note here: i was a huge fan of The skillets this establishment  made back in Illinois which consisted of potatoes,  3 eggs, your choice of 4 kinds of meat , cheese  and,  veggies. This was definitely the best deal in the house for the money, but this pancake house did not have it on their menu. You can order all of these things however,  a la carte but it will cost you, but trust me all mixed together it is quite delicious.

Now i don't know if i will go again on a weekend day, due to the lines but i will have to visit during the week to see how it looks then. Also bring CASH because unlike the location in Illinois they don't take plastic here. So i will keep you posted my friends as i plan to visit them this coming Monday, until then Eat, Drink and  Be Merry!!!!!Read the other reviews, and I agree with all of them. I've had good and bad meals there, BUT it is the only place for an Apple pancake. Don't order anything else. Skip the extras and REMEMBER to bring cash.Lanes ok. Balls ok. Shoes ok. Wings and beer ok. I would come again.Great happy hour.  The bar is comfortable and serves big portions at a good price during its happy hour.  I haven't had a full dinner here.  Super heavy/rich food. Meat intensive. If you are searching for a meal that involves the adjectives "light" or "healthy" this is not the place for you.Average food.  Three of 4 people had food served, after 5 minutes we asked the waitress about the left out meal.  OOOps. An apology, but after 10 more minutes it became irritating.Really, really good food with slow service. I'm torn between 3.5 stars and 4 for this. I would have given higher marks if service was better. I would go back. They had a cool outside patio with a fountain and heaters which would be cool to try on a cool night.

Food - Lamb shank was cooked perfectly. Good sized portion with tasty sauce. Others had roasted chicken and grilled trout which was really good as well

Service - Waitress took 5 mins to first greet us. And it took 10 mins to get my first drink, which she got wrong at first and had to correct. I ordered the grilled vegetables which she said was zuchinni and squash. But it was broccolini when it came. Instead of apologizing, she laughed and said "oh I lied, its not zuchinni".  

Perhaps next time, I'll get a better serverI attended with a large group of over 30. The food was very good. Can't be too hard on the service for a group this size but it was a little slow. The green chili Mac and cheese was unique and very good.My mom and I were looking for a restaurant with a southwestern feel so we went to Roaring Fork. The service was great. The food was good my chicken was a little salty but still very tasty. We tried their signature side (chili macaroni) which was very tasty and their margarita drinks was tasty and strong. When I am in the area again I will def make a visit.Myself and a couple coworkers decided to try Roaring Fork for dinner on a Monday night. Upon entering, we really liked the atmosphere and energy of the restaurant. I will say that the food was mediocre for the price however. 

I ordered the Prickly Pear Mojito and I would not even call this drink a mojito. It tasted like drinking a glass of juice with no mint or rum flavor whatsoever. The green chile mac and cheese is good but nothing I would describe as over the top delicious. I had the grouper for my main meal and I felt the dish was lacking vegetables and balance. I was given a HUGE piece of fish rested on a small pile of spinach. The entire plate was HEAVILY doused in a beurre blanc sauce. Overall, way too salty and not terribly impressive.

The food is ok but definitely not worth the price tag.Went there for a family B-Day celebration and thought it was fine.  Our server did a great job.  She checked in just the right amount of times, not overbearing and didn't disappear either.  As for the food: the roasted chicken flat-bread was a nice starter, Salad was good and fish tacos were well prepared, not too heavy and tasty. For all of that I would have easily given Roaring Fork 4 stars.  The reason I didn't is that their restroom was an absolute disaster. Yes, its connected with the office building above the restaurant but that is still no excuse. And when I write, "disaster" what I really mean is "disgusting".  I won't go into detail other than to say, I rarely even notice a restaurant's restroom facilities and have never written a word about one.  But given the amount of business that Roaring Fork does and the amount of money being spent nightly in this place, these guys really need to stretch the budget to get this facility serviced every hour or so to make sure its clean and reflects the standards of the restaurant overall.No complaints here! I booked this hotel through Allegiant Air, which was a good decision. The cost was affordable, the placement was pretty key. The breakfast was unsatisfying but that's nothing to write home about. Everything felt clean, the staff was nice without being too friendly. I thought it was funny looking out my room at the mall parking lot, with a giant Macy*s sign right behind it. What an interesting and silly place!The pizza was OK. Middle of the road for New York pizzaI'm a NY'er and long time Joe's fan as it is the only place in town with a decent slice.  I must say that lately the quality has been declining.  Not enough sauce on the pies, bad tomatoes in the salad and even some bad entrees lately.  I just hope that someone over there reads these reviews and gets things back to how they used to be as this place has great potential.I'm glad there is a place to get a good slice in this particular part of South Scottsdale. Although the delivery took quite some time , I will say it was worth it and the left overs made a great hungover breakfast.After being in Scottsdale for a couple days and eating mediocre food, I had high hopes for this place and thought it would brighten my food experience.  Also, I was just really craving some good ass pad thai.  Sadly, I was let down.  The staff was nice and friendly, but my food was not that good.  First off, I asked for the peanuts to be put on the side, but it was mixed in.  When I took my first bite, everything was just so grainy and overwhelmingly flavored.  It's almost as though sand was mixed in and everything that would make pad thai taste the way it should was just put in to high extreme.Malee's on Mill is solid, reasonably-priced, standard Thai fare.No idea this place existed even though I drive by this part of Scottsdale often, I had the Burmese gai, which was super spicy and super yummy. It would've been nice if it had more veggies in it, but good still. Boyfriends meal was ok, nothing to rave about.We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. 

The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. 

We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) 

Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.Went to dinner last night with out of town guests.  Got in without a reservation but had to sit in the bar.  Think possibly this impacted our service as it seemed like waiting for our check took forever.  The waiter, Daniel was wonderful about exposing the heat levels as two of us were very sensitive to that.
Food is always good there.  Great place to eat while seeing old town Scottsdale.  We got lucky and found parking right out front.
Calamari appetizer was my favorite part!  And of course the company I was there with...Just not that impressed tonight.  Other than the great service and fun atmosphere, we left a bit disappointed.  The Crispy Pla was a bit dry and lacked flavor, the Chicken Salad Rolls had a great Peanut Sauce, but the Chicken was too dry.  The Drunken Dragon Noodles was lacking flavor as well.I had the crab rangoon, cashew chicken, fried rice, and seafood curry. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes. I've had Thai at many places in the valley and after seeing reviews I had high hopes for Malee's, but the food didn't do it for me. Good location, good service, but overall I'll go somewhere else for Thai next time.After a hard day of shopping at Fashion Square my heart yearns for a Wetzels Pretzel.  This place has never let me down and I have purchased one to many pretzels here, believe me.  In my experience the pretzels are always served warm, buttery, and with the perfect amount of salt.  They have all kinds of varieties of pretzels and sauces for your snack adventure.Meh. Not the best car wash ever but certainly not the worst.

It's a little tricky to find the entrance if you haven't been there before.

I purchased the "best value" $8.99 wash, which was decent enough but there were a lot of water marks left all over my car from not being properly dried.I went to lunch today with a client and since Wildfish was closed we walked over to PF Chang's.

Remember when PF Chang's first opened in the original location at Fashion Square?  What a mob-scene that was back in the day with an hour plus wait for a table.

I haven't been here since shortly after this location opened.  They had a fair-sized lunch crowd and we were seated immediately.

I ordered the almond and cashew chicken and my client ordered the mongolian beef.  Both of us were happy with our dishes.

PF Chang's is definitely always a very consistent dining experience.So we went there last night for my bday. We had reservations at 645 and then had to change them to 715, when we got there they only made us wait about 2 mins to clean the table, which was nice!  Allison was our server, which we had her last time as well- super nice, once again:) Great service! 
I started with their Bloody Mary not spicy and my husband got a Fat Tire on draft. The bloody mary was sooo spicy even adding tomato juice hah so I ended up getting something else, which they were very accommodating. We started with the chix lettuce wraps, which were awesome as always, then I ordered the Changs spicy Chicken and my husband ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Rice. I was a little disappointed that the Changs spciy chicken seemed a little dry and I have gotten it in the past with success and the Shrimp and Chicken had 6-7 pieces of meat in it. Bummer. TONS of rice tho, you should see the bowl it comes in, so if you like rice with a taste of meat, its your meal, I wouldn't advise for men! Then they brought out a dessert shooter for my bday which was nice. I only had two bites and my husband ate it, which he loved. All together a good place to go, just bummed that the food was a little blah this time. The manager usually comes to the table and asks how everything was and what not, I would have told him our service was great but he was hanging out at the hostess station... but like I said all in all a cool place.When your the only person in a large dining room, you should be able to get a water refill, but not here. Well buddy, you earned your 64 cents tip on my meal. Sign up for the email club, get a free appetizer. The lunch costs $7.99 with basic pasta, soup or salad. The minestrone was horrid and from a can, but the large rigatoni with rosa sauce was quite good. Also good was free bread and my free app choice of cheesy florentine bread. Manager was eating lunch at 1pm and restaurant was a ghost town for some reason - maybe because you get no respect if your a solo diner. With another coupon would try different location.You come here for the family meals and will be full after you leave.  We had the mussels in the white wine sauce, spaghetti and meatballs and the pesto stuffed chicken.  We ate it all and enjoyed it.  No big surprise with the dishes.Overall, it was good, but not great! My husband enjoyed it more than me. Really quiet for Thur dinner... 
Only 4-5 tables full (mostly couples). Not greatest spot for kids cause of noise level...really quiet inside. Our son is kinda loud : p  
Service was good, but not excellent. 
Sauces ok.
Breads ok. 
Dishes ok.
Could have better sauces or better flavors.  
Nice romantic atmosphere-they dimmed the lights & with our toddler that wasn't a good thing. Better for couples. 
Dishes a little more than they are worth.As a house band, Metalhead puts up a great show... The upstairs patio is surprisingly comfortable.  The only truly rough thing about this place- good luck trying to quickly slip in & out of the bathroom.  They could stand at least one more pair of facilities...Came out to see Rocco DeLuca and fell in love with Deep Eddy Sweet Tea Vodka.This is the kinda place that you somehow end up at once again. Seeing somebody's friend of a friend's band that's ok and can get the job done, open for another semi-marginal band that's touring and has about 5,000 likes on the good book.

Drinks are obviously over priced, and all over the place depending on which bro or babe is making it, but you can't be picky because it can take a few to get one of their attention.

Now for the place, they need a complete change over/re-branding. Martini in your bar/venue name is sooo 2000 and late. Now they have a killer setup that sounds great, but things just miss the mark when it comes to being a great venue.

This place is just average, so don't expect to leave pissed off, but don't expect to be wowed by any means.I admit that was scared away from the habenero burger by the warnings on the menu. Fear of blindness of any length will keep me from ordering any item.  I did order a cheeseburger expecting similar love and taste to be put into this burger. Not true. Burger was dry and boring.  My wife ordered a turkey wrap with jalepeno bacon, which she loved. 

The building looks like a modern Scottsdale building outside but a cave inside. Pretty cool. Service was good.I think the prices are a little high but the outside patio is fantastic. I think happy hour here is good, but it only goes until 6 pm. I've had a good number of things off their menu:

- Tacos: Three tacos for $14 is a little too pricey to me for what they are, but the same dish for $7 at HH is spot on. The black beans are incredibly tasty (lots of spices and vegetarian), and the tacos are traditionally what you would expect. They subbed in vegetarian mexican rice for the meat for me, which was great. Love the guacamole on them, but otherwise standard ingredients for tex mex.
- Chips, salsa, & guacamole: Good but I hate paying for chips & salsa at a mexican food place, especially one whose prices should afford a free basket. The guacamole is delicious. The salsas are pretty good, nothing to write home about but good all the same.
- Nachos: My friends love this dish, it's giant and enough to feed two. Unfortunately there aren't much of toppings on it besides the meat, beans, & cheese.
- French fries: These are AMAZING! You get a heaping amount with a burger and they are perfection. Soft on the inside, beer battered or otherwise some kind of crust crusty on the outside, and perfectly seasoned. I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to make a meal out of their french fries, guacamole, and beer. 

So I recommend it for an outdoor happy hour if you can manage to get there early enough to enjoy it, otherwise there are a lot of good places at the same or less price in Old Town.If you are looking for an authentic southwest atmosphere do not come here. I would compare this to a Joes Crab Shack southwest style.  The decor was very cheesy. While the food was of good quality it was way overpriced. Did I mention it is overpriced? One and done with this place!Always a great place for lunch.  Had Chili and wings today.  You can't go wrong with the burger, fries and rings either.Seat yourself restaurants, especially sports bars during large sporting events like March Madness, make me uncomfortable. I hate hawking tables waiting for people to leave so I can jump in the booth while they are bussing the table. 

After 8+ hours of watching March Madness at home on Saturday, my husband and I decided to venture up to Zipps in Scottsdale to catch the second half of the last games of the day. Luckily despite the crowd and having to seat yourself, we got a table within five minutes or so of arriving. Our waitress was very nice and even when she got my order wrong, she fixed it quickly and apologized for it.  We had the chicken nachos which I didn't care for too much because they use shredded chicken and I prefer the pieces of chicken meat. My husband had a slice of pepperoni pizza (described as just OK by him) and I had the chicken caesar foccacia with half onion rings (for my husband) and half french fries.  If the menu hadn't said my sandwich was supposed to be on foccacia, I would have never guessed. It came out as a wrap cut in five pieces and it was almost impossible to eat as everything kept falling out.  The onion rings and fries were forgettable...supposedly the fries are fresh cut, but I didn't get that sense.  Thankfully prices are incredibly moderate and for our food and 2 32 oz domestic drafts ($4 after 8 on Saturdays), our bill came to $29 without tip.

It looks like Zipps has a pretty decent happy hour and also runs nightly specials after 8 pm.  There are TVs throughtout the inside and on the patio, so it is a good place to catch sports...they had two different college games on that we could see plus the Suns game. I will go back to drink some beer, watch sports, and play shuffleboard (or shufflepuck as it is called in Ohio), but not for the food.I have to give it to Zipps. On game day, this is the place to be. I don't think I can name many other places as packed full with sports fans as this Zipps on a Sunday afternoon during football season. If yelp did half stars, I would give Zipps another half for the ambiance of a sports maniac haven. So, if you're ever looking for a fun place to throw back some drinks on a Sunday (it could even turn into a Funday), turn here.If you find yourself in downtown Scottsdale at lunchtime you might drop in at Don & Charlie's, the sports memorabilia paradise which incidentally serves really good steaks, chops and ribs. The main restaurant isn't open, but the lounge hosts The Burger Bar from 11:30 to 2:30 PM. 

The menu is small. There are a few appetizers - guacamole (not the best in town) and a Cabo style shrimp cocktail ($6.95) which I've heard is quite good. A few salads - chicken  
Caesar and Mediterranean with chicken, both $8.95. They looked tasty and were quite large. And a few uninspiring sounding sandwiches.

The real reason to come here is the burgers; big, juicy and cooked to order (even if the menu says differently). The basic burger is $7.95, and nine variations are listed (all $8.95), but you can create your own for the same price. Slaw is served alongside. But, get this, for $1.95 you can get a huge plate of delicious onion "strings". I don't know why they're called strings, which are often dry and overcooked. These are basically onion rings which have been cut open so they're not round (again, I have no idea why). Fries are the same price, or you can have half and half.

The other reason to go to The Burger Bar is the broasted chicken. This is half a chicken  deep-fried in a pressure cooker. According to the explanation on the menu, "pressure frying seals in the flavors and seals out the oil". Ken will attest to this. The chicken was nice and crispy, not greasy and not salty. And the price was right - $9.95 for a serving size that runs at least $16 almost anywhere else. A word of caution. The chicken isn't pre-cooked (thank heavens) so it takes 20 minutes to a half hour to reach your table.

There's a mini creme brulee ($1.95) for dessert. This lone little offering struck me as very funny. 

While you're waiting for your chicken you can walk around and look for artifacts from you favorite team. It's a fun place and a most reasonable price for lunch.My husband had been to Don & Charlie's 8 years ago and it was a "must go" for this Spring Training trip. We arrived at opening and there were at least 50 people waiting on a warm St. Patrick's Day, which looked like a good sign. In retrospect, we needed the Luck 'O The Irish to turn this "so so" meal into an exceptional dining experience.

The food was good -- coconut prawns, french onion soup, prime rib -- and the service was warm, pleasant and fast. Actually, too fast. We felt rushed to get through each course so they could clear the table for the hoards of people waiting to get in.  It wasn't anything to write home about, but worth another shot.It's not every day that you get the opportunity to meet Willie Mays and get his autograph. You would think this story has a happy ending, but think again. I arrive at Don & Charlie's and find my nephew near tears. He had stood in line for an autograph only to find out that it was for charity and would cost $200! On the plus side, photographs were free as long as you did not use a flash. 

This restaurant has its pluses - the chance to see someone famous. Lots of great memorabilia. Awesome creamy cole slaw. Decent menu, if you like big portions and traditional ribs, chicken, steak or prime rib.

Some of the negatives. You can't be seated unless your whole party is there... we had one member of our party that was lost and didn't get much help from the front desk when he called for directions. Meanwhile, we stood waiting and worrying we'd lose our table. If you are a large party, don't bother going here during Spring Training season. They don't take large party reservations. 

If you are a BIG baseball fan, it's worth a visit. If not, then choose somewhere less crazy.Visited Don & Charlie for two consecutive Saturdays for dinner, the first visit was 4.5 stars and the second visit was only an average 3-star, rounding up and down? Hmmm

FIrst visit -  Very impressed by this museum-alike restaurant with all collections of baseball, hall of fame, jerseys, baseball bats, or you name it, all about sports! The manager or a guy in nice shirt got us a free cheese bread on the bar while we were waiting for our table as it was our first time, the cheese bread tasted almost like the Chicago-styled deep dish cheese pizza. Our order of medium rare prime rib and the BBQ pork ribs arrived pretty quickly after order is placed and the food was delicious.

Second visit - We come back with a group of 6 the next Saturday, reservation was made for 7pm and just about 10 mins wait and we were seated. Waitress was an older lady who took care of us very well when took our ordering, however, one of the broccoli sides (and it happened to be mine) came out way over-cooked, you can so easily by the almost yellow-ish color when there was a comparison to a well-cooked one, and the taste was just...(don't even want to describe). When asked for a replacement, I was told that it has to be re-ordered, not sure what that means, but sure, i'll wait for another one...5 mins later, 10 mins later and.... until we finished our dinner, the broccoli still did not show up... the waitress had a few other tables and seems very busy, she came only once to check and left right after, I didn't even get a chance to 'chase' my broccoli...I guess it was good that 'extra order of broccoli' did not show up on the bill... And it took way to long for her to understand how to split the bill even when we wrote it down by credit card and amount... So be sure to tell your waiter or waitress to split your bill before it arrives!

p.s. This is a popular restaurant, parking seems to be filled very quickly, you might need to park along the street side or the bank's parking lot across the street...This was my first time here at the recommendation from the friends we were with and it was also restaurant week. I didn't partake in it but boyfriend did.

The place is a huge memorabilia center...and its full of old people. We were the youngest people there, but I don't think that's a downfall...just funny.

Most people are aware of how restaurant week works - 3 courses usually ranging from $30-$40 on a fixed menu. You also receive a free app when you check in- either the cheesy garlic bread or the onion straws. 

One thing I think is a rip off when you do restaurant week with these guys is that if you are two people ordering the restaurant week, you only get one app between the two of you - yet you still pay $30 each. The food is plentiful, but I just don't think that's fair. 4 people out of the 6 ordered from the restaurant week menu and I had the free app so we had the onion straws, cheesy garlic bread, and the spinach dip. The onion straws were bland, the bread was good, and the dip was good.

Boyfriend had the prime rib with the twice baked potato, friends had the ribs with the twice baked potato and another the salmon. All came with cole slaw, either deli (vinegary with a kick) style or creamy (more traditional in my mind). Prime rib was good, not the best, salmon seemed ok from what she told me, and everyone agreed the ribs were the best. The twice baked was yummy (how can you go wrong with baked potato loaded with cheese?

My other friend and I had the french onion soup and the wedge salad. The soup was bland was really pisses me off...this isn't just to this restaurant, its to all. I am not a huge salter, I am very conservative with how I use salt, so for me to go to a restaurant and think something is bland means that it was WAY under seasoned. The salad was good but again, how can you go wrong with something so simple? The portion was huge so boyfriend and I shared that.

I think the real kicked with all of this was the price of the bill. It was $90 per couple including tip which on a regular date night I wouldn't think about, but from what everyone said I was expecting it to be more of a deal and better food. I think anyone is always upset when they don't get what they expect and have to pay a good amount for it.

I would go back here again, but maybe not for dinner, maybe for happy hour or just a couple apps or something. I hate giving bad reviews, and really tried to look on the bright side of our experience and that's why I settled in the middle with three stars.Not a bad place, and... errr... Not really a good place either. There's nothing distinguishable about this place, but it seems friendly, and their prices are decent. Bonus points if you have to live in that south Scottsdale/Thomas rd. corridor. Its very spacious there too, for those that are somewhat claustrophobic!One of the bars in the South Scottsdale Dive-Bar circuit.  Prankster's is the go-to spot when day drinking at the San Tropez pool just isn't enough - I usually (100% of the time) regret my decision to continue the festivities but always have a great time doing it!

The thing about Prankster's too is that you have to have the right mentality when going there.  Don't expect one of those 'looks divey on the outside but it's probably nice on the inside' bars!  This is one of those bars where you can play pool, toss a game of video bags, drink 32 oz beers, catch a local live band, or just sit at the bar and wait - because ineviteably someone interesting will sit down next to you.

Note that I omitted the following things from that list:

1.  Feeling cool wearing designer jeans
2.  Feeling cool with hair product in
3.  Feeling cool really at all
4.  Picking up chicks
5.  Impressing chicks that you've already picked up

If you live in the So Sco area and don't want to drive very far and just want to get drunk, head on down to your local Prankster's Too.  You'll probably regret it in the morning but at least you'll have a good, inexpensive time that night.Hmmmmm. Came by to see the Chanel bag I've been eye-balling for months. The sales lady was nice enough to take it off the shelf and let me play around with it. 

I said I would have to think about it and come back (since it was $2,105) and I had to decide whether or not I wanted to get this seriously get this bag or go buy a laptop. LOL.

Came back the next week to finally get it, and it wasn't there on the shelf anymore! I said I would have liked to see it again so I could go home with it the same day of purchase. In which she says, "Well you've ALREADY seen it already". Jeez. I know. It doesn't matter if I've seen it once or twice. It's a $2K bag, lady. 

So since the store was out of them, she had to order one from Texas for me. When I got it delivered to my home, it had a scratch on the hardware.. so I returned it, no questions asked by another employee. 

I think I'm gonna take that money and get a computer now..Ordered some beer mugs and they only had one of the four made up when I arrived.  I had to come back the next day for the other three.This is an old classic. It's neat enough inside to go just for the hell of it. It's like an antique or a museum piece. The drink prices are from a different era as well. If you can grab a good spot, you'll have a nice comfortable evening. The place is tight and kinda cramped though, so if it's crowded you may only want to go if you like rubbing up against strangers (you do like that, don't you - sick dirty pervert).

The decor is not as inspired as a proper hip dive bar should be, and the typical crowd here isn't very remarkable. Coach House dances on the edge of cool.

The experiences I've had here over the years have been a mixed bag. The crowd is also a bag - a bag of douche. It's best to go on a night when it's slow and bring your own crowd. The staff here is good... apart from the security - which are humorless thugs. 

Two stars on busy nights because of the type of crowd that occupies it, and a potential for four on any other given non-busy night. In any case, it's totally worth checking out at least once or twice.if you are stuck in old town, go here. otherwise, there are better and cleaner nail salons in central phoenix!

all customers there were new and none were regulars.

tip:make sure you bring your own color!OFGS - Lighten up people.  The food was really good.  This is like an old school restaurant.  Flavors were well balanced and the food was cooked just right.  The main idea here is keep your expectations inline and enjoy.  Oh, and the salsa dancing etc. is great.  Go and live a bit of a past.This is definitely an out of the way, neighborhood hangout. They have one dart board, one pool table, a small patio, and a VERY small bar. The place is cramped and tiny. If it were downtown with a patio out on the street, it would be a priceless place and would be packed every night. 

It's not though. It is in the middle of a residental neighborhood, can't be seen from a major street, and look's closed from the outside. They don't offer food, but they make up for that shortcoming by offering ridiculously cheap drinks and even complimentary pool on sunday nights. They have cans of PBR.... how punk rock is that?

I'm incredibly partial to the bar because the walls are full of british motorcycle ads, pictures, and memoribilia. Even the sign out front is a rip off of the Triumph logo. Being that I own and ride two Triumphs, obviously I felt at home here. It is a great place to park your chopper out front and play some pool.I like coming here after work because they have a good happy hour menu. I like the edamame, philadelphia roll, shrimp tempura roll, and viva las vegas roll. I've tried most of the other rolls and thought they were kind of blah. The martinis aren't that strong. I agree with the other reviewers that it's very loud inside. The Kierland location is much quieter and has more tables outside. They won't seat you until your whole party gets there (even if there is no where to sit at the bar), but that seems to be standard at a lot of restaurants nowadays.We couldn't get into Ocean Club, so we ended up at RA Sushi.  A very cool & chic ambiance.  Menu was good and looks like it's a fun place.
However, I was very annoyed at the level of service.  We ordered 3 things...  and she forgot one of them.  I mean really?  I didn't make a big deal of it as we weren't in a hurry.  Would we go back?  Only if we couldn't get a table at the Ocean Club.Let me start by saying I do not eat sushi. So this review has nothing to do with fish... can't comment on that. Anyway, I went here last night for my new sister in law's bachelorette party. When we called earlier, the hostess said they do not take reservations, even for a party of 9 people. That was weird considering it sure seemed like some parties had reservations. So we got there and were told a half hour wait which we spent in the bar. Now, we didn't get seated for an hour... that's just not cool. Their drinks were alright, but overpriced. When we finally got seated things got better. I ordered the uchi no salad and some gyoza. The salad was really good, I just love that ginger dressing. The gyoza were fine, nothing crazy special, but not bad by any means. Everyone seemed alright with their food, so that wasn't the problem. The real problem was the service, the hostess, and the music (we couldn't hear each other at all... and I know it's in old town and everyone wants to party, but I would like to hear conversation).Sub par sushi. 

Ra was the first place I had ever tried sushi and I really enjoyed it. However, after broadening my horizons and dining at other sushi establishments (Hiro, etc.), I discovered that there are much better options all over the valley. 

If you go, I would recommend the Las Vegas roll (not sure what's in it) and calamari roll (fried calamari, cream cheese, white rice, and topped with eel sauce and tempura flakes). Both are decent and are much better tasting than their other rolls.

They have good happy hour deals. Rolls are definitely much smaller here than anywhere else I've been.Good Tex-Mex in Old Town Scottsdale. I enjoyed it. The service wasn't the best, but our meals were good. Chips and salsa were just ok.

The must try are the sopapillias (sp?). Great stuff with honey.

However the building itself and atmosphere was nice and I enjoyed the patio seating.Food was good. Slow service. First time that I've had to walk outside through a parking lot to get to the bathroom.The food tries to be authentic Mexican but falls bland in flavor.  Very average Mexican food.Service was just ok, food was good but a little too pricey.  They were really slow to get us food and check.  Would not go back.While here during spring training and trying to figure out something to eat I decide to use yelp for some help. I was looking up all sorts of places until I thought maybe pizza might be a good choice. Also was going to meet up with a friend who was in town for business. That never happened, but dinner did. 

Looking over the menu before heading over to the restaurant helped. I knew what to expect and found stuff that I could like. Looked over the menu and ordered a half cheese and half pesto large pizza. I also ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomato basil. It was pretty good. I then ate the pizza and didn't notice anything special about it, except that the pesto on top of the cheese. CHEESE?! Yes, it was on top of the cheese. I didn't notice it was salty until the person I ate with tried it. It was salty and they like salt. 

I'd come back again and the fact they have outdoor indoor seating was good. The outside was windy and they have a patio area inside that was good. Overall full and decent prices for a meal.Grimaldis has a nice atmosphere and the pizza is good but so are many other pizza places throughout the valley and for about 1/2 the price. In fact a simple trip to "Slices" at Desert Ridge can get you a better tasting slice of pizza for a couple bucks. I had to vote I like it because I didnt hate it but seriously whats the big deal. Again many better tasting Pizzas out there that dont make you feel like you've just been robbed as you walk out the door.The food was very good here however the service left a little to be desired. The waitress never came back to refill drinks. We found a manager to do that. After he did that, she checked on it once more.Eh, it was ok. We ordered pizza to go from here and it was cold and sort of disappointing. Will definitely pass on this place.I love the atmosphere and the waiters are always fun, nice and attentive.  The pizza is just ok but nothing special.  I judge a great pizza by the crust and this is pretty run of the mill.  The best pizza in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area is Pomo and Andreoli when they serve it.On a business trip I stopped here for lunch one day.  I had spaghetti and meatballs.  It was very average, I would say no better than the Olive Garden.  The service was decent and quick.  The atmosphere was pretty cool too.  There is better Italian food at a Deli / Italian grocery down the street, much better.Food was good.  Portions were small.  Not the cleanest retaurant I've ever been in.The grapevine has a WONDERFUL patio that gives a glimpse of the mountains, Old Town Scottsdale and the stars (at night, of course!). The service was okay--the hostess didn't quite make things clear about what was happening.

The food was also okay. I had the taco salad (the chicken was wonderfully spicy, but the salad could have had more variety in it). My parents split the ribs, which they said were good, but didn't seem to have a deep flavor to them.Good lahvosh, nice patio and service was wonderful. The Southern Desert Cooler is a great summertime beverage!I LOVE karaoke & I would NOT be offended if you called me a "karaoke whore." I sing in the shower, I sing at the grocery store, I WAIL in the car, I LOVE to sing! So when my Yelp-mates decided to visit the Grapevine, I was allllllll in

Please know that the Grapevine is a dive and people here sing a ton of country music. They've got a guy who runs the karaoke and sits in a small booth in the corner of the main bar. You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends. The sound in the bar is a bit off balance but the Grapevine offers a fun time!!

31 Yelps Challenge: #3/31I've only ever sat outside at The Grapevine so I'm not reviewing the apparently dark divey inside bar.    We had a great time.  I never had Lavosh before I tried it at The Grapevine and my eyes have been opened! (It's amazing - if you've never had it, it's basically cracker-pizza, except fancier.)  

If it weren't such a drive to Scottsdale I think we'd come here more often.We took advantage of the free museum entry at the Sunday A'fair event. It's definitely interesting, but you can knock out the whole place in under an hour. The exhibits on our visit were interesting. I can't say that I'd run back to visit, but it was a nice place to kill sometime.I made my first trip to Bandera a week ago or so. Actually I forgot I'd been there until I saw Gabi's review. I wasn't particularly hungry when we stopped in for a late dinner before Nathan's surprise party, so my meal consisted of a few sides. We started with the obligatory cornbread skillet which everyone raves about...I wasn't crazy about it. I love the idea: cheese, cornbread and green chiles, but it was WAAAAY sweet for me. I definitely expected something more savory and cheesy, but the sweet corn over-powered everything else. 

My 'meal' was the side house salad and a side of mac and cheese. I make really awesome m&c so I wasn't uber impressed with bandera's version but it was good nonetheless. The 'nice little house salad' was indulgent, my favorite part by far. Well-dressed, ribboned lettuces and cabbages, with I think 1/12th of an avocado and a tablespoon of goat cheese and a few other bits and pieces tossed in. 

Our server was pleasant, service in general was quick and we were seated right away too, which was surprising on a Saturday night around 9pm. I would go back if someone suggested it.Sooo I went here with a friend who is well...older...than me. As soon as I waked through the door people were staring at me like I was a sugarbaby. Looking around it didn't seem so uncommon. It didn't help that my friend decided to squeeze into my side of the booth. The bartender nearly chocked when I ordered a glass of wine and took a look at my ID. Anyways....never really into the whole scottsdale scene.  The wine suggestion was superb and service was great. Cornbread was ok didn't live up to the hype. I got the salmon and it was tasty. All in all just didn't live up to the hype. Oh well...good place to bring a sugardaddy lol. Just Kidding!We have been to Bandera quite a few times over the years since moving to the valley.  Service is always great.  Food is consistent and fairly good.  

Over the years the prices are consistently increasing and portion sizes getting smaller.

Went Friday night and ordered the rotisserie chicken dinner.  $17 for chicken and a side of slaw! My wife ordered the grilled salmon.  Unspectacular and with over abundance of black pepper.  Nothing I couldn't cook myself on the grill at home.  Probably have trouble making the fancy grill marks :-)

Unlikely I will make a return visit.Heres the thing, I love thier coffee but not when they make it. I used to hate this place till a friend gave me a free bag. 
When I made it like a normal human does it is the best coffee I have ever had. 1 tblspn of coffee grinds to 1 cup coffee, best way. The actualy instruct you to use almost double. 
Pikes placeis the freshest coffee ever. It comes from the plant to the store in a garunteed 14 days. It is way fresher than the rest and very very good when you make it.

I give them 3 stars because, while they put such care and standard into thier coffee, they carlessly poison you with the pastries. They get them from a local vendor. Its loaded with trans fat and saturated fat the light scones have around 1300 calories in one. 

When they place the nutrition facts on the sign with the name of the pastery or make them with real oil, they will earn those 2 stars back from me.I make a real effort to avoid chains, but I can't stay away from this place.  We have one in KC and it is the perfect solution to a Sunday hangover.  

Fresh, fast and clean....I feel good eating here.This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it.This is a nice place for quickie food. Feels like a good variety for what they serve. my fave are the lettuce wraps because they're not quite so spicy. Some of the foof can be too salty, but I'll admit my tastes tend to be bland. quick service. it's a good standbyGood ambiance, good dinner 3/5

Berk, Dorfy and I were at the Pinon Grill restaurant on Saturday night for our long-needed girl night out! Berk and I stayed at the Millennium Resort at Scottsdale, where the Pinon Grill is located that weekend. 

We started with two appetizers - baby ribs and mozzarellas and tomato salad. We were really impressed by the ribs and the salad! Good job on that! On the entree, we had the scallops + grill shrimps dish, buttery sea bass dish and a steak dish! The seafood was good but only so-so in their steak. Overall, I think with the price of every dish (average of $28-$30 per dish), the quality of the food was average. Service was good, but not above the par compare to other fine dining. Not above average with the price. Desert time!... we ordered a fruity cream brulee and a very chocolaty  chocolate cake! They were good! Berk and I hit the sack after a good dinner and good laugh. Good restaurant with good friends on Saturday, but a bit doubtful I will check back again in the near future! Too many good options out there! :)Interesting evening with my wife.  Waiter and manager were leaning over the back of my wife's booth having a great conversation.  When i asked them to back off the waiter was polite and did so, the manager was not so nice and could not help making a number of ugly comments to me.  Weird attitude since this is a nice place, used to be my favorite.  I used to go here anytime I had an associate in town but now I go elsewhere.  Attitude is everything and if the staff have an ugly attitude then I make my graceful exit.3 words - s car go

one of the few places that serves it and they do a bang up job
throw in a Manhattan and I'm happyI would bet the 5 star love is from folks who are the uber high end shoppers, so that the $1200 purse that resales for $400 is their steal of the century.  

I much prefer viewing their high end deals from their online site (often the best gets sold immediately though), as I find the place a bit jumbly... but I am sure that is really a matter of mood / mindset / patience to search for your treasure.  I did walk out w/ a beautiful Gucci and was assured the buyers are fully trained for authenticity... but stilllllllll... I just have to wonder.I was just wondering what was going on at a place I used to go to once in a while - California Pizza Kitchens - so my wife and I decided to visit the one near our home.  It looked just like we remembered it.  The food was just like we remembered it.  The service was the same.  Everything was almost the same except there weren't as many customers as we used to see.

Like all of us, I'm afraid, CPK is aging.  Almost every self-respecting pizza joint today offers pizzas made with fresh mozzarella, at least as an option.  Not CPK. And floppy or soggy crusts are no longer acceptable.  That's the problem at CPK - they have not kept up with the overall rise in quality of restaurants that has occurred in the last 10 years.

They do have a few new "small plates", but half of them are just miniature pizzas.  The asparagras and arugula salad was good, however.  Other than that, there is little that is new and little that is above average.  CPK has become boring, kind of like this review.  Too bad.In mid-January of this year, my wife had I had to go to Arizona for a conference, and we were looking for places that were unique and/or different -- food we couldn't get in Berkeley, or rather, foods that were "typical" or "classic" to the area.  (Why travel to Paris and order pizza?)  At first, this seemed (at least to us) a relatively simple and even obvious idea.  In reality, however . . . 

So our "fall back" position was Elements, the restaurant within the "Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain Resort and Spa" -- self-described on their website as "Celebrate the rebirth of elements, as Sanctuary introduces the evolution of a favorite restaurant into a stunning new experience of Arizona luxury dining. Discover the cutting-edge kitchen for new cuisine, new style and new decor that lives up to the spectacular setting."

Uh, yeah.  Well, moving past that, at least we had Executive Chef Beau MacMillan -- he of Iron Chef (he won) and the Food Network ("Worst Chefs in America").  How bad could it be?

Not bad at all, actually.  But on the other hand, it wasn't exactly great , either.  It's not classic American for, but rather "modern" American infused with Asian influences from miso to kimchee, ponzu to hijiki, and more.

The view from the dining room can be spectacular -- but we (there were four of us) were seated as far away from the oversized picture windows as possible.  (Not that big of a deal, as our reservations were long after the sun had set.)  Indeed, the interior design of the restaurant is also stunningly beautiful.  Unfortunately for the design of the room we were in, it was also exceedingly loud . . . .

We started with appetizers:  fiery calamari (fried herbs, pepperoncini, miso scallion vinaigrette) and shishito peppers (crisp garlic, sesame).  Both were very good, but not great.  We also had the ahi tuna tartare (cucumber, toasted pine nuts, green onion, sesame crostini), and fire roasted bone marrow (Korean chile glaze, shrimp toast, coriander peanut salad) -- both were delicious.

The drawback here was that we'd ordered all four at the same time, but only the first two were served . . . and when we were finished with those two, the next two arrived as a separate course.  Now, once the tartare and the bone marrow were served, we sort of figured it out:  the calamari and shishito peppers were large enough to share; the tartare and bone marrow were not.  Ergo, the waiter decided to bring out the "shared" appetizers first, but as this was never explained to us, we kept wondering where the rest of our appetizers were . . . 

Indeed, the service was polite, even friendly, but it was also "off" all night long.  Things like water was brought to the table late, and only refilled if we asked.  The bottle of Champagne was served barely cool, let alone chilled.  (Wouldn't it have been better for the waiter/sommelier to explain the wine wasn't chilled, and we could either wait a while while it sat in an ice bucket OR -- sorry -- we could select another bottle?)  Unfortunately we weren't given an option, and were served a Champagne that hovered between lukewarm and barely cool -- which was definitely NOT cool.

Speaking of the wine list, overall it's rather good with reasonable prices (save the "reserve list"), although dominated by California wines -- mostly Napa -- with a smattering of French.  No local (Arizona) wines, which was something of a surprise as they can be surprisingly good, even excellent.  No Spanish wines, either.  

Entrées included braised short ribs (truffled mac & cheese, crisp kale parsnip salad); bacon-wrapped filet of beef (caullflower, roasted shallot, asparagus, blue cheese, zinfandel syrup); maple leaf farms duck (forbidden rice, cherry-braised cabbage, fragrant black bean drizzle); and Maine lobster udon "carbonara" (pancetta, oyster mushroom, Thai basil, tomato jam) -- all four were delicious, but -- whether it was our own expectations that were too high, or the meal itself -- it just seemed like it was missing that certain something, that spark, that would have made the meal not only memorable, but would have made us look forward to when we could return.

Instead, it's more of a "been there, done that, got the T-shirt" sort of experience.I would love to give 5 stars, however the valet was atrocious. I've met strangers that were nicer. Our taxi was having issues processing the transaction, and the valet guys did everything they could to dramatize the situation (which was about five minutes long at eight o clock). There are two lanes so we were not blocking traffic, but one valet felt the need to yell "Jesus Christ Asshole" in front of a family of four children under the age of 10. I've never had worse or embarrassing service. Definitely was not a great way to start out an expensive meal. They must have known with a cab that they weren't receiving a tip, I guess. 

On the other hand the food and views are absolutely five stars. I would love to dine there again. I think these are some of the best views in Arizona!I was in a bind and really needed some "emergency" toiletries and thankfully our dinner plans were located right next to CVS Pharmacy. We don't have CVS where I live and thought the selection of items was really super. I got my "emergency" toiletries and proceeded to buy huge amounts of make-up wipes. I don't know why, but I have a horrible compulsion to purchase anything that's BOGO at 50% off! 

I went up to the counter to purchase my items but no one was at the cashier stand. I looked around and thought "Uh is no one working?" I guess the cashier had gone to the bathroom, but regardless it was all very odd. The cashier came back and checked out my items. She was nice enough to scan a CVS card to activate the discount for my bulk make-up wipes, so I have to give her kudos for that. Thanks CVS for helping a girl in her moment of need!

31 Yelps Challenge: #5/31I really wanted to like this place. In fact, when asked by my Husband where I wanted to go to dinner this past Saturday night, I picked Razz off my list of "must try" restaurants. The only problem with that was Razz left us with a lot less money and still hungry, which is NOT my favorite way to spend a Saturday night. 

For a 4.5 star restaurant on Yelp, I really expected more. The decor in the restaurant was ok. I would have preferred to sit at the bar, as it looked more "happening" then the part of the restaurant we sat at. Our table was lopsided and it was hard to cross your legs because the table was low (just a couple minor things). Our waiter was clearly trying to up-sell us on everything, but it was hard to choose items because we were observing passover and couldn't eat bread. When we got our two meals both of us felt they were tasty (short ribs and duck), but not worth the $80 price tag the meal cost us. We didn't get any drinks, nor appetizers, just two entrees and water for $80, and to top it off the portions were SMALL. I am a small person, who watches what I eat, so rarely do I finish a meal when we are out, but at Razz, I had to, just to attempt to get my money's worth. With that all being said, I don't think we will be back to Razz anytime soon.Celebrated our 20th anniversary at Razz's---first time visit.  Sat at the bar.  I had the tasting menu----one tasty little morsel after another was placed before me.  I ate several plates past my comfort level!  DH had the Thai spiced pork medallions and he said it was the best Thai he had had since we left California many moons ago.  I hope we will visit again soon, although there are so many intriguing restaurants in the area....Nice comfortable hotel.  No coffee available from 24-hour room service.  Musty smell in room 606.   Great patio.  Good but expensive breakfast buffet.-Spa Review Only-

My Husband and I decided to celebrate the first day of 2014 with massages and a day at the Spa at the Camelback Inn.  I've heard wonderful things about the resort and spa in particular, so I felt this would be a great way to kick off the New Year.  The spa is tucked away at the back of the resort, so once we found it we were checked in a directed towards are respective locker rooms.

The women's locker room is a decent size, maybe a little outdated, but overall quite nice.  My locker was tricky to get into, but had enough space.  The robe I was given had stains on it, which wasn't the greatest impression, and the sandals I found to be a bit uncomfortable (as did the Hubs).  Once I changed, I lounged in the waiting area, which was packed before I was called back for my massage.  There were so many women being called back for services, it wasn't quite relaxing, but oh well.  My massage was ok... nothing really to remember, but it was relaxing (I'll take it).  After our massages, the Hubs and I met up and had lunch by the pool.  I LOVE the views and it was nice and quiet outside.  The waitresses were very nice and prompt.  The weather was beautiful... I mean honestly, does it get better than sitting by the pool on January 1st???

The banana smoothie we ordered was delicious as were the sliders, really tasty and cooked perfectly.  The beet salad was bland and the beets were a bit too hard.  After several hours reading by the pool and hitting the hot tub, the Hubs and I adjourned to our locker rooms to shower and use the facilities.

All in all, I found the spa to be nice, but lacking something.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful, but there is something I enjoy about a more intimate atmosphere, like the spa at Royal Palms.  Despite some minor things, we had a great day enjoying the beauty at this spa and celebrating a new year.Waited at the pool for 30 minutes before being served. Comfortable beds. Live band at night. I didn't pick this hoyel , randomly it was selected. It was OK for the price.CLOSED

El Torito has shut its doors.....it will soon be torn down to make way for a Walgreens.  Their happy hour will be missed.Had never been to a Residence Inn before but will now try to stay at them whenever possible. I really liked the layout of the room, the fact that there was a kitchen and that I could be more self sufficient than in a normal hotel.

This location was central to everything I needed. Staff was friendly, free breakfast buffet was good....they even have a "hospitality" hour in the evening that could pass for dinner. Room was spacious - good TV, lots of towels, plenty of closet space. I was able to open one window for some fresh air, which I always appreciate in a hotel.

Cons: bed was hard so I didn't sleep well and for some reason, the running of the bath/shower in the unit above me was super loud. It's not the hotel's fault that the person above me wanted to take baths at 4:30 am, but I wish the running of the water didn't jolt me awake.Sometimes everything does not go as planned and such was the case in dining at the Village Tavern. This is a meat and potatoes spot and I really wanted something light. 

The ahi was just not good. Neither was the wine list. The shrimp taco's were marginal.
So, you ask: Why did you order seafood? Sorry, my bad!

Service was nice, but am thinking with as many excellent restaurants as there are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I can skip this spot.Dropped in on my lunch break with 8 co-workers because we heard this place had some decent lunch specials and it was conveniently close to our office. Let's start with the atmosphere. They had both indoor and outdoor seating, which was very Ikea/contemporary. It seemed like they only had two employees for the whole cafe, which wasn't too bad considering we only saw a few tables taken on the patio, but one of the two employees was in the kitchen cooking our food. It took us a while to get our drinks, which were just water by the way. We ordered and had to wait over 30 minutes to get our food. In our group, we had a mostly chicken, cheesesteak, and french dip sandwiches, and a burger, so it shouldn't have taken that long. 

I started my meal with a cup of their pasta e fagioli. It tasted very fresh and was served in the same amount as a bowl which was nice. Just when I was starting to see the bottom of the bowl, our entrees were coming out. I shared the cheesesteak (including a side salad about the size of a regular salad) with my co-worker. The bread to the sandwich was fresh and soft. The steak and peppers were cooked very well, I was just hoping for a little more flavor. They didn't smother it in cheese too, which was a nice change. The "side salad" was simple romaine, a few toppings, and a light vinaigrette. The whole meal wasn't too filling, it hit the spot pretty well. 

Pros: Price (Average lunch price w/ tip: $15), Fresh ingredients, Great location (two doors down from 21 Cakes and Yogurtland, yum!)

Cons: Their bathrooms (They smelled rancid, no toilet paper, and just plain dirty), Service (They should have at least two employees running the bar and tables)I liked their Caesar salad, which had cashews instead of croutons.  We split the chicken and spinach pizza, which was decent, but not a homerun by any means.  The wine could use a bit of work.  I'm sorry, but Cetamura chianti is not worth $9 per glass.  I know that places sell wine to pay the bills, but at least make it interesting.Good food and good service. The pear and walnut salad is great. However, the place lacked an ambience and I wouldn't really want to go there for a weekend night. It is also priced on the higher side.The steaks are tender but they are so soaked in butter that I felt I was eating a movie popcorn bucket.   Thes service was great, but the food just average.look this is an average gun store. I have probably bought 3 guns from this place but I usually buy them from their booth at the gun show. They have a descent selection to choose from but I wouldn't buy a knife or ammo from these guys(knives are so much cheaper online). The prices are average but you can find better prices if you call around also the store is kind of small and crowded.We've been fans of Lon's for years. The patio, the dining room, the food, was always dependable and a cut above.  For Sunday brunch, I ordered the chopped salad.  When it arrived I thought I'd been transported to a fast food take out. Iceberg lettuce, 2 pieces of dark green lettuce, 3 microscopic pieces of chicken, and a decorative something or other on top...I have never, did I say never, sent anything back in a restaurant, but back this went. I reordered the turkey burger, which another in my party had and hadn't complained about. The waiter was most gracious and accommodating. The side salad with the burger was fine. The burger was dry and tasteless; my husband later said that his was too. The other two people in our party had omelettes and were very pleased with their selection.  All in all it was a disappointing experience. I don't know if this will continue to be our "go to" place for lunch and brunch. The kitchen needs a jolting heads up and perhaps a new chef.Good little country restaurant. A Cracker Barrel before Cracker Barrel.I do like this place. I just found it a bit hard to really sink my teeth into. The menu is an array of chicken and steak, with a duck and lamb dish. Decent wine selection, but nothing to get excited about. The place just comes around as a little too generic. It's not really French, not New American, just 'Bistro'. If you are looking for a quiet classy dinner in your neighborhood, it will likely do the trick. I just don't see it as a place you would brag about to your friends.New deep dish pizza was alright, only in size medium, and can certainly give Pizza Hut a run for the money.  This location has an enormous seating area, friendly staff, and plenty of parking.  Nice location SE corner of Pima & Pinnacle Peak.A small resort for a weekend get away.  The rooms comes with a full size kitchen, half size frig, and a small stacked washer drier.  It's a lovely little place to spend a quiet time away.  The pools are large with a hideaway jacuzzi area to relax it.  DVD rentals in the front for entertainment and room service from their on-site restaurant.  (You can order into the room after hours if the restaurant is closed.)  There's free wi-fi if you want to bring your computer for things.  Parking was kind of a issue since the spaces were small and the lot was very full despite it being off-season.  Friendly staff and quiet please made for a nice relaxing weekend retreat.  There's a steep $35 cleaning fee that is charged at the end so take it into account when you're budging.If you don't care about watching what you eat, you've found the right place. The dishes that I tried were all very good (taste-wise), but you feel like you're carrying twins after you get up from the table. As far as portions go, this place is very generous. Their daily soup offerings are surprisingly very good and some of the best I've had in the Valley so far. The rest of their food is pretty heavy, but alright when it comes to flavor. It kinda borders on bland and not-too-bad. The food's heaviness really over shadows any taste that it might have. In truth, this spot is really "old money" dining on a Friday night, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you come here though, be sure to make this your big meal for the day because you're going to feel like you're wearing an inner tube around your waist by the time you're done.Good vegetarian food. The pitas were fresh made and the vegetarian kabab was good. Decent service.Had the lamb shish kabab.  It was fair.  Not seasoned very well and the lamb was marinated too long, poor texture. The cherry rice was good and the service excellent.Cox mailed a new cable box, and we were supposed to send the old one back with the carrier. However, carrier left it at the door without ringing or knocking, so i tried to take the old box back to this location at about 1:30. . At least 6 people waiting, with 3 employees on hand already helping customers. One employee disappeared during my 20 minute wait, and as another 6 people came in one of the two remaining staff advised them that it would be 15-30 minutes. I left. This place needs to hire some more people, and they need to open earlier. Staff was nice, but they are overwhelmed.
 
OK, I returned today and found more people working the floor. My wait was only about 5 minutes. Maybe less, and the person who waited on my was fast, friendly and efficient. There were still plenty of customers in need of assistance, but because of the increased staff they were being helped in a reasonable amount of time. I am moving my one star rating to a three star rating. They still need to show that they have enough staff on a continuous basis.my friends and i stopped by here on our way to the rogue to drink a good brew before we loaded up on cheap pbr.

we arrived late on a friday night, and the place was semi-full. man was this place a freaking sausage fest. the only chicks in there were either on a date with a dude or the regular bar rats. of course, strange looks galore directed at us being completely different from everyone else in there. i just came for the beer, not for the atmosphere. it's like a sports bar and it's just set up weird, sort of like a restaurant, but no one was eating. everyone was in their own little group. 

our server mike was excellent and what really made the experience. we were informed that their cider tap just went out, which sucked because we wanted a cider/stout combo (like a black and tan). he whipped up something similar and brought samples in little beer "shot glasses". his cider substitution was great, and our beers were delicious and smooth. $5 each for our custom beer pints. not bad. 

overall, great beer list, and service, but just not my scene.I like it for the selection of beers, however, I hate the bar itself. I would rather go to Total Wine and bring my beers back. 

4 stars for the selection
2 for the shitty bar atmosphere

3 average.I have mixed feelings about this place. It's in Scottsdale but nothing like the typical Scottsdale bar. It is small hole in the wall place in a strip mall. It's dark and has an odd smell but it's not pretentious and very mellow atmosphere. They are known for the orange blossom beer which has a cream soda taste which I did not care for. They have board games available which is a nice touch.OK so I am 50/50 with this place.  So with that being said here I go.  I have never had a bad time here.   The best thing about this place is the beer selection!  You can have no complaints about that, it's not possible.  What I don't like is that it's almost pseudo trendy.  It's a mix crowd of the Scottsdale douchebags or inundated with artsy people.  I cannot quite grab the specific vibe of the place, heh.
   As to what other people saying that the service being slow, I would tend to agree but of all the several times that I have been there, the place has been understaffed, and the staff I felt as though did extremely well with what they had to work with, so I will not knock them for that.  My waitress the other night earned her tip.  I didn't mind shelling out a few extra bucks for her.  All in all I will go back if that is what my friends would like to go, but I would never suggest coming here.  It's just OK.We've gone in here a couple times when we've stayed at a nearby hotel and have to admit the service is s..l..o..w.  But the beer selection is always great and while slow the service is still friendly.  The first time we were put off by the building being in a strip mall but once inside it is a comfy, laid back, cool place.  I haven't tried the food but it looks and smells really good.  While I can understand the frustration in having to wait to be helped, we go in knowing we will have to be patient and it pays off in the end when you have a tasty cold beer in your hands.  We will be back.Simply put, 5 stars for the beer selection, 4 for service, 2 for food and space. More texture...the beer selection is excellent they know there stuff and are very helpful with selection. The tap beer provenance, with at least our choices were solid, and there are hundreds of chilled bottled beers available as well. Well played. The food on the other hand was a disappointment. Bland, boring and prepared with little care. Lazily prepared Quesadilla was burnt, and the salad looked bagged and tired.

Go for the beer, stay for the...beer.we decided to run in the other night to get takeout. I was a bit surprised at the price because instead of a flat fee, they charge something like $4.99/lb so they weigh your container before they charge you. The soup prices were insanely low though, like 4 bucks per large container. 

I'm gonna be honest, this place is a little (alot) divey and I've seen better spreads BUT they have a nice dessert section and some of the usual popular stuff like walnut shrimp and lo mein and etc. 

We ended up walking out for about 18 bucks for two containers worth of food and a large hot and sour soup. Fine dining it is NOT but the food was hot and filled us up. It wasn't the best chinese food we've had but we didn't have to wait, the prices are decent and the food was tasty enough.

I believe it's family run and the owners were nice and friendly when we walked in. It's a nice option for when you're on the run and need a decent meal quickly.I don't like Denny's at all. 

If I wanna get the type of food Denny's serves I'd rather go to some other diner or sports bar type place. I've always found the food here to be overcooked & served lukewarm as if it has been sitting around awhile and just reheated a bit as food is ordered. I mean this for all Denny's, not just this one.  

That being said this location was recently renovated (and close by to where I live), and the inside is actually quite nice (I think they also have a patio). The couple times I've been here since the renovation the service has been good (the restaurant also wasn't crowded either time).

Still not a fan of the food here, but since it's by my house I don't mind coming in for a cheap Grand Slam breakfast every now and then. I also believe this location now has liquor license since the renovation (at least that's what a waitress had mentioned to me), so there's that...I've been working out at LA Fitness for a few months now. Not too many complaints. 

The gym is a good size. It does feel like it could use a few more machines and benches. When you go at a busy time it's a pain, but my schedule allows me to go during off hours which is nice.  The trainers and staff tend to leave you alone while you do your thing (unlike the trainers that always stopped you to offer you a free session at my last gym).

I love taking the spin classes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Both instructors give a really good and intense workout. LA Fitness also offers a ton of other group classes that I keep telling myself I should get around to taking.   It also has a pool racket ball courts (I never play, but at least one is always in use), and a basketball court (don't bother trying to use it unless you want to play with a group of guys that are probably way better than you). 

The people there are exactly what you'd expect to see at a gym that costs about $25 to $30 dollars a month. I'd like to be able to afford to work out at bigger and better place, but LA Fitness is definitely more than adequate to fit my needs.i'm a member of two gyms....la fitness and 24hr fitness. this gym has everything you need but it's way crowded at peak,,,impossible. BEST SPIN BIKES EVER...kaiser m3'sI have a pretty hard time getting antique merchants to take me seriously. They almost always assume I'm some little girl who wants some storybooks and not a serious collector who would pay $200+ for the right first edition Dr Seuss book if it presented itself. (So what? I'm a 24 year old who looks 13!)

That was how it went down at this place. The guy actually laughed at me when I asked him to open the case to see his first editions. 

But that embarrassment aside, the variety was wide and I enjoyed walking around looking at how many different things they had. I really liked the section with all the rock memorabilia. Not just the Beatles like most stores but also Bob Dylan and other staples ;}When in the mood for bagels I go to Einstein's with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einstein's draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade.Probably the standard for bagels in the valley... Meaning if someone in your office "brought bagels" they probably came from Einstein.  Ok when toasted and topped with something, bland and too bread like for me when eaten alone. This location seems to get new management every couple of weeks, and the latest iteration seems to have things dialed in... The woman in front of me order about ten things, and then I ordered my single bagel. Oh great, here's a good fifteen minute wait I thought (Einstein runs a strict assembly line system usually, so orders are preped in order, regardless of the inefficiency this can bring). However this time, the staff banged out the massive order very quickly, before I had even gotten my coffee. While this situation was acceptable, too often I've waited for 15 minutes for a non-toasted bagel in the same situation. I realize typical bagel slingers aren't rocket scientists or efficiency experts, but the management should correct this glaring inefficiency. Being fast is about all this place is good for really.Good cheap mexican food...that's it.  Don't come expecting more than that.  I like it during the day though because, again, it's cheap, good and the portions are pretty hefty.I always like to say super burrito is super at 3 am but not so super the next morning.  Jokes aside... It's great for that past midnight bite to eat, but with places on 68th street like tacos Jalisco or the amp market open they fall way short.  They do give you good value and solve hunger issues but they are kind of like the last option for Mexican in south Scottsdale.Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying "okay" and "yes" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say "yes" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying. 

Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints. 

As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies.I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco.My hubby is obsessed with crab legs, so every year for his birthday I take him out to places I know he can order them. He is always down for Red Lobster, but ugh I'm not, so I searched for an alternative. We had been to Salt Cellar once before, but that was about 4 years ago, so I thought we should check it out again. I made reservations for Saturday at 8pm, but I let them know we were running 30 minutes late & they said that was totally fine because they were a bit backed up that night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes & our table was ready. The dining room is small, I'd guess there were only about 12 tables in there. We got an awkwardly placed table that faced everyone, & since it was up against a wall we had to sit side by side. It sucked but oh well, we were so late I was glad they still sat us! I do love how this place is underground, but the decor is so boring/dated!

I can't remember our server's name but he was very nice & checked on us often. For starters we got the bucket of steamed mussels with sides of plain butter & butter with herbs. This bucket seemed bottomless, I swear there were at least 50 mussels in there! One thing that bothered me about this app was that it smelled fishy to me, didn't taste fishy though so we didn't get sick, but still. The complimentary bread & whipped butter they brought out was pretty good. Onto our entrees; hubby got the king crab legs (1.5 lbs) & I got the baked stuffed lobster. Both meals came with a salad, veggies & rice or baked potato. They cracked his crab legs & my lobster at the table & then we dug in. Hubs loved his crab, the meat was fresh & sweet. My lobster was ok, the crab, scallops & bread stuffing were too much for me, I would just order a regular lobster in the future. 

Total for one cocktail, an app & 2 entrees was about $130 (not including tip). While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy, I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance, so I think 3 stars is appropriate.My wife and I heard this place was better than another high class restaurant that will go unnamed, from a professional chef.  He claimed the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Also that in addition to the steak, at the Salt Cellar you get two sides.  So "you get better value, and better tasting food for the same price!"

I like a good steak.  I picked the ribeye (one of my most favorite cuts), and waiting in anxious anticipation.  I had high expectations and was very excited.  My wife ordered the stuffed lobster, and we waited.  The atmosphere was nice.  The furniture could use updating, but everything was clean.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.

When the food came it looked wonderful.  However, the steak was tough.  It tasted good, but it was very chewy.  While it looked to be cooked to my liking, I expected it to be easier to chew and swallow.

My wife was very pleased with her lobster.  She raved over it, and would probably give a 4-5 star review.  The service was the redeeming factor for the Salt Cellar.  But for that you'd be looking at 1-2 stars.We came here to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. We're a mixed group from all over (Texas, Florida, Maryland, and California). The exterior of the place looks a little odd....... you have to walk down a few flights of stairs to get to the restaurant. But it sure is a lot cooler than down there!!!!! Kind of a unique looking restaurant. 

I'm a natice Northern Cal girl, born and raised in San Francisco....I have fresh seafood at my fingertips on a daily basis. So I was a little skeptical about a seafood place in Phoenix, AZ.

I ordered the New england clam chowder and it was pretty good. Not too salty!!!! I also had the fried shrimp dish. It was prepared just right.  Overall, everyone orderered seafood dishes and enjoyed them. 

The Snicker's cheesecake was wonderful.

Service was good.........a little slow. Apparantly, the server has to manually compute the tabs if you ask for a split check.  Menu is a little pricey, but worth it for "Fresh" seafood.Three and a half stars. 

I was compelled to see what the winner of Scottsdale's "Best Neighborhood Bar" looked like, especially since it is only a few miles from my house. 

On Friday night, my roommate and I trudged over to Longshot's only to find a packed parking lot. Good sign. 

We walked in and I could immediately see what the "Best of" people saw in the place: a small, smokey sports bar with great specials on draught beers, pool tables, dart boards, and karaoke. I think when they say "Neighborhood" they mean "Dive," which I was ok with. 

They were busy, but the service could have been a lot better. Granted, there was a boisterous bachelorette party to contend with, but, we were seated at the bar and getting a beer was no easy task.

Between the service, the smoke, and the drunkenness (which is not always a bad thing, but in excess, too many hammered people around each other in a small bar is not good) I wasn't crazy about it. 

I almost tried the chicken wings but couldn't pull the trigger on them. 

This would be a perfect guys night out or girls night out spot if you are looking to get more than a little drunk. For a beer or two, head to Papago Brewing. For twelve or thirteen, post up at Longshot's.Many thoughts come to mind now that I've experienced Triangles:  stripper, Halloween, swimwear, scandalousness...

I'm torn between two and three stars.  On one hand, the place is staffed with apathetic, unenthusiastic teenagers.  I'd lack energy too if I worked in a disheveled shop for the naughty.  This is one of the only stores I know of that does not have a computer, or even a typical cash register. When it came to purchasing my thigh-highs, my order was written down on a carbon-copy notepad and summed by calculator.  No joke.

Yet, there were more costumes and accessories than I've ever encountered.  Forget the Halloween store--this place has a much bigger selection of sexy costumes.  I must say that every costume looked like it had been previously worn...Anyways,  this place has everything conspicuous.  Need 8" platforms?  Pasties?  Maybe a glistening beaded bra?  Sexy schoolgirl outfit?  Triangles is the place to go. 

Plus, Triangles offers a nice selection of quality swimwear. I'll definitely come back when summer rolls around. 

Sorry guys, this isn't like Fascinations where you'll find accessories for your sex life; Triangles is exclusively women-oriented. I prefer it this way--I can't tell you how awkward it is to make eye contact with the curious male while browsing skimpy lingerie.I haven't written a review on Yelp in a long time since most of my reviews are for restaurants/eating establishments and I haven't been able to taste food properly the past couple months due to radiation. 

That being said, the pizza here is terrible. 

The crust tastes like cardboard & I don't know what they use for cheese, but it's not cheese.

Of course, the pizza is just a small reason why you'd even bother coming here (do people actually come to Peter Piper specifically for the pizza?).

My nephew likes coming here and I'm glad he'd rather come to this location than others since it's small and the couple times I've been here with him not that crowded. Sure, it probably doesn't have as much to offer in terms of games as some of the other locations, but I'm not the one playing them & he's only 4 so he's good with what they got.I have a friend who works here, and sometimes she invites me down to hang out while she works. I live close and the promise of free drinks and naked breasts doesn't hurt. 

The girls here are pretty good looking for the most part. The drinks are average prices. They keep the place clean and the ambiance is cozy and fun. It's not as dark as some other clubs which is nice... it's not too bright either. 

The girls are required to paint liquid latex over their nips and they have to keep their bottoms on due to the laws in Scottsdale. If you want to see more, you'll have to go elsewhere. This place is supposed to be owned by Jenna Jameson, but I have yet to see her step foot in it. She does make her way around Scottsdale a lot though since she lives in PV. You probably have a better chance of seeing her if you go clubbing downtown.

Babe's often has special guest dancers... famous dancers or midgets or whatever... I always seem to miss the fun stuff. I usually don't go here for the dancers - I just go to hang out with my friend... if I had to pay to get in, I'd probably never go. In fact, since I wrote this they stopped accepting free passes and I haven't been back. 

Still - it's a pretty nice place and the girls are cool and personable and clean. Some of them put on a really good stage show too. You'll leave here covered in glitter and smelling like stripper, but that's why you have a gym membership (so you can shower before you go home to your lady), right? 

I've only been to one or two other strip clubs in my life (obviously I've been to more since I wrote this), so I don't have much to compare it to. I consider this more of a casual experience - like, you could go here just for drinks with friends without having to go just to pay women to touch you. Another positive I should mention about Babe's is that the girls aren't all on meth or coke or whatever like some other clubs. Not to say they're all clean - I have no idea... I just know that they seem that way for the most part.

*I've edited this review (June 08)... since I first wrote this, I've had more experience with gentleman's clubs. I'm keeping it at 3 stars, but honestly after having been to a bunch of other places, I think Babe's is pretty nice in comparison. It's probably a 3.5.Better than average American style Chinese food.I use this Place for delivery whenever I don't want Pizza or Burgers. The food is fine not the best but for the price its just fine. Plus delivery is fast.Chinese is Chinese and I have bad, disgusting and have had tasteless crap but this was tasty and speedy delivery and can't say anything bad!Wonderful food but the owner is RUDE and Disrespectful.  I would not take the chance.  There are many other restaurants that want the business.   Go somewhere else!Sorry, Defalco's - I have to take a star off for you always being so slow!  Really, every time I've been, there is a long wait - and your food is worth it, but isn't there a way for you to speed things up?

The register is old school and it always take forever to ring in an order... and then I have no clue what kind of system you use to prepare food and bring it out, but for the number of employees you have working, there's got to be a faster way?!

Bottom line - if you are not in a hurry, and you want some good food - go to Dafalco's!The food is excellent but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been going to this place for years and I'm on my forth time of telling myself to never go back due to the frustrating, slow service. Hey, I know that good food takes time to make but when I have to stand and wait for 15 minutes to get the food that I called in that I can see is just sitting on the counter well the blood pressure just gets raised too high to make the experience enjoyable. And the staff (other than the new guy that's now bringing out the food) don't seem to really care about the customers.   They hide behind the excuse that "good food takes time" but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up.  I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service.It's a decent place. Nothing unacceptable about most of the food, though the canoli I had tasted a bit stale. We picked up a meatball and half a hot roast beef sandwhich. Both were decent. I just hope this isn't the best that Phoenix has to offer.Everyone has their own idea of how pasta sauce should taste, unfortunately D'Falcos isn't the best in my opinion. I like my mom's much more especially with her Sicilian upbringing I might be asking too much. But their eggplant is awesome it makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it. What I also feel needs improvement is I wish they were open a bit later. For Italian food than is adequate as a dinner entre being open later than 8pm on weeknights would be appreciated but then again im just one person. I do like that they are very similar to the new york city delis and that is something I definitely dig.Was on ASU main campus and wanted a quick nibble and drink...
The line at Einstein was super long so I figured I would make my way to College Ave. I had always seen Cupz but never went in...
The line was quick and the guys who were working were very nice...
I ordered a hot cinnamon apple cider and a breakfast sandwich... With ham and cheese on a Parmesan Asiago bagel...
The cider was okay, I liked it because it was nice and hot, for the chilly morning...
The sanny really surprised me because it was good; very flavorful and the bagel was yummy... 
I'll pop back in again soon to try some coffeeAce is always more expensive than other places, but the folks there sure are helpful and know what they are talking about.**********This Time We Didn't  Do Carry-Out*********

Definitely better ......... when you eat there.
This place is like Pei Wei ........VERY LARGE chunks of meat.
Vegatables ...... NEVER.......Just like Pei Wei........their priceless.

WARNING:
Hot Tea is available for $2.00
*********Brown Rice instead of White ......... ALSO $2.00*********
The Soups are TERRIBLE.It takes a great deal of perspective and mental channeling to give this place even a neutral review. However, I feel the positive deserves to be mixed in with the negative, because, overall, this place is decent during happy hour if you get past the club music, mediocre waitstaff, and often scantily clad clientele. It's even better when you're not planning on driving home.

Their happy hour is one of the best deals there is for sushi. With $1 sake and 1/2 of many rolls, nigiri and appetizers, it's worth eating here from 4-7 or for a late night sushi fix during reverse happy hour. While the sushi can take a very long time, a $4 martini usually gives me enough patience for the wait. The sushi itself is palatable, which is why it's only really worth it to go during happy hour. I wouldn't feel right paying full price for that quality. 

As much as I try to block out the music and hormonal collegiate surroundings, it can be difficult. The music can be as distracting as the flaunted flesh everywhere. If reminding myself that cheap sushi and a good buzz is worth it doesn't work, I'll cut happy hour short and probably won't return for another few months. But for the purposes of this review, RA Sushi is enjoyable during the right time and with a flexible state of mind. Getting into that state of mind with a couple rounds of sake is my strategy.Unless you come here for Happy Hour I'd say this place is over priced.
My friends and I used to come here for reverse Happy Hour on the regular for drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately, corporate did away with it. Which i think was probably a pretty horrible business choice considering there are a million other places to go to on Mill, which is exactly what we did when we found this out.The sushi quality is ok. it's near my house and during happy hour it is pretty good value for healthy food. it's definitely a college crowd.Eh. Is all I have to say. I have come to this location multiple times now for lunches, happy hour and dinners. I normally have a good experience eating just some good sushi in the Phoenix/Tempe area.

This time I felt like our server took forever to introduce herself to us and get our drinks. We were starving at this point!  Speaking of drinks, I'm not sure what it is but the water there is disgusting! You absolutely need a lemon or it is impossible to drink. Our rolls and miso soups came out next, which were pretty good. Just remember Vegas Roll. Order it.... Next she brings 2 of the 5 lunch meals and does not bring the remaining for another 5 minutes. RUDE. Bring everything out at once! I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and the chicken was dry, will not order that again. Not pleasedOK, so here's the thing.

I love the sushi here. I really do. I've gone to this location many times and I really love the rolls. Notable favorites: Vegas Roll, Dragon Roll, Tootsy Maki, and Spicy Tuna. Also, they have garlic edamame here and it's AMAZING. 

Is there a fun, great variety? No. Is the sushi "best in the world" quality? No. Is the music pretty loud? Yes. They DO have reverse happy hour, which is of course great. However, the first time my friend and I came late at night, there was no problem; the second, we were told that unless we were of age to drink, we couldn't come in. It didn't make sense. We were not trying to drink or sit at the bar, and it's not like RA becomes some sort of nightclub after 10. Still, the waiter refused to seat us.
So that was kind of, well, off-putting. It's the main reason for 3 stars rather than 4.

Otherwise, it's fine, but there are better sushi places out there.Reasons to go to Four Peaks:  1) You're hungry, 2) you're thirsty, 3) you're meeting friends with a wide variety of palates, 4) you're meeting a LOT of friends,  5) you're meeting friends who like to play photo hunt, and don't need the "erotic" adjective to find it fun, 6) you're meeting people who you don't plan to talk to, so having a game on in every corner of the room is to your benefit.  

Four peaks is comfort bar food with comfort beer.  It isn't the greatest, but it is far from the worst.  It was a fantastic place to go after the Tour de Fat in Tempe.... when people wanted a little grease, a place to sit, and one more beer.I went here today for lunch with some friends to celebrate the end of our first year of grad school (yay!). The place has a nice atmosphere, and it was nice sitting outside, especially on such a nice day like today was. This place was really busy when we got there today at around 11:45. One of my friends got a burger and said it was pretty good, another got a salmon sandwich which she likes a lot, another got the grilled chicken beer bread sandwich, but she didn't care for it. I tried hers and I thought it was good, although a bit bland. I ordered a special, the BBQ chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was good, it had chipotle bbq sauce, chicken, cheddar, and fried onion strings. The onion strings really made the sandwich (well, more like a wrap...but whatever). I got the balsamic dressing, and it was really good. It was probably the best thing we got. At the end we all split the stout tiramisu. This was pretty good, but I like the classic better. It is tiramisu made with chocolate mascarpone and with stout beer. I couldn't taste the stout much after the first couple bites, the chocolate took over. I would definitely come back, as it was decent, and they have beer and whatnot, but it wasn't the best place ever, just alright.If you don't go during happy hour its pretty overpriced. The bento box was a good deal though. California rolls, chicken teriyaki, rice, corn, and a salad for $7. Everything was okay. Definitely not the best sushi I have ever had, but not the worst either. In the long run, its close to my apartment so, if I do have a sushi craving, I'll probably be returning but I'll probably wait until happy hour.Middle-of-the-road sushi joint.  I'd recommend going here during happy hour so you can get decent prices.  Service was very friendly and helpful despite what many others have said.Ehh, it's alright. Only go there during the happy hours. I especially love the reseverse happy hour. Otherwise I'd say it's overpriced for the quality. The service varies, sometimes excellent other times meh :(MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!!!!!
If I want to go deaf while eating sushi, I can go to Ra.  This new policy at 101 is a disappointment.

But the Happy Hour is the best deal in town and 98% of the staff is incredibly courteous and sincere. 

So the management gets an A+ for hiring and training  . . . and a D- for letting the same (very young) staff run the stereo!!!

Sorry, just annoyed that my ears are still ringing. 
(not kidding)This place has closed permanently. Major bummer, Mill keeps hiking the rent and there are not many businesses left that can afford it.Yes I would tell as many people as I can about this place.. they are good even though I was gipped out of some avocado. But they did redo my order. So yes would come back and let as many know about this place. Thank to the store for the redo. :-)You can't beat the price of $27 to include cart after 12pm. The front 9 is mostly par 3's with some challenging holes. The back 9 opens up a little more with some short par 4's and longer par 3's. Overall, a fun course if you're looking to get out for a quick round with family or friends who are not expecting pristine conditions or country club appeal. Course conditions varied from hole to hole though.

Nice lounge for a beer and hot dog or sandwich after the round. They did have a cart person with some good beer specials too, as well. 

If you look up toward the nearby bluffs, you may see some wildlife since this course is right next to the zoo. You'll hear an occassional call or other animal sounds too.

So if you're looking for a quick round to tune up your shot making, this may serve the purpose. I was surprised to play the full 18 in just over 3 hours on the Wed before Thanksgiving, course was busy but moved along. Enjoy!Z'Tejas is not a place I would go out of my way for in terms of the straight-up quality of the food. It's somewhere between ok and good.
I've tried a few of the entrées but none of them really stick in the memory. The cornbread is good.
I do end up there alot for after work margaritas and the Tejas Trio (chips with quac, salsa and queso). The chips are good.
Also I wish they were open later. It's hard to find a quiet place in this hood that's open late night.
Also, I've ended up having some pretty great conversations at this place and that must mean something... they just haven't been conversations about food.Oh this CA girl who formerly believed Z'Tejas was Tex-Mex. Now being a recent Austin resident, I know this is not Tex-Mex. I was not happy that I had to valet my car-this is not the type of restaurant that needs it. I guess it's due to the high density of restaurants & shops as well as the close proximity to campus that makes this a necessity. I guess it's helpful.

I like the happy hour deals on appetizers, which means I did not spend as much money. Enjoyed the dumplings; Ahi was ok; pulled-pork nachos were meh; catfish tacos not so much.

My Z'Tejas Saviors: Corn Bread. I will go back just for the corn bread. Tableside guacamole-yes please! The portion is too big for just two people though and I really doubt anyone would want to bring it home.Salad was great, food was bland. Table side margarita was served in a pint glass? Focus on service was very impressive. A sign of great management. Wish the enchilada special would have been all that. Next time?Great service and food. Cheap too. Motif is early reggae stoner basement.Plus side: Kitchen included cooking/eating utensils, clean, near Tempe hot spots. Bad side: can get a little noisy, staff was non-existent, and housekeeping services can be an extra charge. Overall, for the price charged this is a pretty decent deal.LIKE:
- Friendly, personable *customers* 
- Friendly, personable *staff*
- Best place to find Mojo back-issue CD comps.
- Good local music selection

DON'T LIKE:
- Unbelievably crowded parking lot. Really sucks. :(
- No paper zines (Hoozdoo doesn't count.) And it's next to a bookstore.
- No Cocteau Twins, no This Mortal Coil, no 80's-era 4AD.
- No Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. All of which has been reissued.It's a chili's. Pure and simple. if you go when everyone else does, it's going to be crappy, if you go at 3pm on a Thursday, it's going to be slow and you're going to get the best service. It all depends and it's just a chili's. Come on now.Nothing extraordinary here. Seated our large group outside in the cold when the interior restaurant was empty. Food was decent, same as any other in this chain.In my few trips to Tempe, I've found myself here more than once.  In fact at least once a trip.   I'm just not sure why. 

The first time I found myself in Arizona, this place seemed like an Oasis in the desert.  It wasn't super pricey, they brewed their own beer (my biggest weakness), and the food was not your typical menu.  The second time, they were out of their summer seasonal which began their downfall.  

The menu is fairly run of the mill and a little overpriced for the portions you receive.  The food is bland and not exciting at all, except for the garlic fries (which have so much garlic on them that you can't enjoy them). 

That said, the atmosphere is nice.  The light sconces are make of barley and beers (kitschy but cute anyway).   And the service is good.  The other day, my sister and I had a good time with our waiter.  When we heard him say "wooder" we asked if he was from NY or NJ (northern, clearly he was a Giants fan) and got "Oh, NEW YORK!" as a response.  Then we discussed south Jersey shore towns.     

One thing I've noticed is that their hosts always have a little bit of trouble getting their act together.  I know there are two room and outdoor seating, but come on...From now on, no matter how good other things look on the menu, I will only get a beer and fried artichoke hearts... and maybe a wedge salad. I have been disappointed the last two times I've been there. The calamari was so bland that we sent it back after one bite. The new Caribbean appetizer platter was gross - the mahi mahi was so over-fried you couldn't' tell what it was, the "Kobe" burgers were over cooked, and the sauce for the ahi spring rolls was basically orange mayo. SO, lesson learned - stick to the things we know....artichoke hearts and beer!ASU ASU! I went here to watch the last home game and have a few beers. I go to Gordon Biersch when no one can decide where to go for 2 reasons: 1- they have beer and 2- they have a vegetarian, vegan and gluten free menu if you ask.... Always a plus in my book.First let me say there are several flights of stairs to get up to the restaurant brewery so don't drink to much. They do have a elevator if you can't so stairs after eating one of their burgers or drinking to many beers! Personally I like the place because while it's on Mill ave aka college party street, it's not inside.Their beers are decent and worth a try, nothing special but good! The service is great, fast and they refilled our waters and brought the check promptly. Their  burgers aren't ridiculously over priced but for lunch it is a little pricey. Overall A+After canvassing the valley for a new bedroom set a couple of months ago, I was about to give up all hope when I finally wandered into Z Gallerie. Problem was, I didn't know exactly what I was looking for... I wanted something simple, but not too simple; something modern, but with a retro twist; something cool, but without looking like it's trying to be cool... Not too much to ask, is it? Not at Z Gallerie, where I found exactly what I was looking for - at what I consider very reasonable prices ($600 for the bed, $300 per nightstand). In addition to the furniture in the store, which in addition to furniture included lamps & artwork, we were shown their catalog, which contained an even larger selection. After not finding anything I liked anywhere else, I found myself now having to choose between several different bedroom sets.

Service at the time of purchase was pleasant and helpful. Once I made my selection, I waited patiently while the cashier called the warehouse to find out if the items were in stock or needed to be special ordered (longer delivery time). I was informed that my items were in stock and would be delivered within 2 weeks. Sadly, this did not happen. In fact, nothing happened. I never heard from them again. When I called them I was informed that my items had to be special ordered, and would not arrive for 3-4 weeks. I was assured I would receive a phone call from the delivery company within that timeframe. 4 weeks later, I called back to find out what was going on. I was told a manager would call me back. I left three additional messages over the next three weeks (each time providing my phone number), before finally speaking with a manager, who informed me that my furniture had arrived the week before. The problem? She said they had wrong phone number on file. If I hadn't provided my phone number 4 times, this could have been a valid excuse. But I did. Each time.

My furniture finally arrived this afternoon (8 weeks later), and while I love my new bedroom set, the customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

4 stars for their furniture, 2 stars for their service.I was disappointed  only because the last time we stayed here, about 1-1/2 years ago, we were really impressed and have been telling lots of other folks about this hotel! At that time the rooms were fresh and the whole experience was great ~ from being able to leave our car in the parking lot for 2 weeks  to the filling breakfast we had before leaving for the airport the next morning! 

The best thing about my stay this time was talking with the cheery but tired mom of 2 who was working a 16 hours shift behind the front desk because they are "at a skeleton crew." My room was just down the hall from the front desk and I guess it was clean enough, but it was looking a little ragged ~ the whole ambience seemed to be "slightly run down"... And the air conditioning unit would periodically become very loud for a few minutes....

The reason we stay here is because of the 24/7 airport shuttle. Upon my arrival I was informed that they have no shuttle driver, but when I asked about getting to the airport at 4:00 am, they promised that I would get there. Knowing I would be gone prior to their breakfast being served, the clerk suggested I ask the morning clerk when I check out about getting some fruit or something from the breakfast room before I go.  The next morning the guy behind the counter did call a taxi and paid the $13 fare to the airport. When I asked if it was possible to get something for breakfast he offered me water, a banana and a protein bar. 

For the price I paid for the room, I guess I expected more....I liked this place well enough.  More so than anything else, the fact that four of us spent only $60 for a filling meal will lead me to come here again.  However, in thinking about what to write, nothing about this place really came to mind, which is why I'm inclined to give it 3 stars rather than 4.  And, the fact that our server seemed to be annoyed by my 11-month old nephew's presence at the table will lead me to keep looking for other restaurants.  

So, if I find a better pita/middle eastern place in Tempe, then I will likely go to that other place, but in the interim I'm happy to go to pita jungle to get decent middle-eastern food.  No big complaints, but really nothing memorable.

(I will update this post if/when I go back and try more dishes.  Two of the other three persons I dined with greatly enjoyed their food and would likely rate the place higher than I do, but, well, this is just *my* two cents.)I'd eaten at this location dozens of times until I started going to other Pita Jungle locations. This Pita Jungle has less then desirable service and the food is not as good as it is at other locations. However, I LOVE the hummus!

On the flip side, they have the best art at this location.

I always thought they should utilize their space a little more by having an open mic night, or just local musicians playing in the corner.Not my favourite location, but I love this place so it's hard to make myself rate it low.

Wait, no it isn't.

Let's face it: service here isn't as friendly or fast. Our waitress wasn't bad but the rest had attitude written all over their faces. Lots of local art, pretty cool. More space in this one is a plus, and it was quieter. 
Also the food is not nearly as good. I had the falafel pita, which I haven't had before. It was dry because the tahini on it was such a small amount it was hardly noticeable. It was a disappointment and I've had falafel pitas of higher quality and better taste from a stand in a mall. I'll keep my business at Indian School... Sorry Tempe PJ!It's odd to me that no one has mentioned how filthy this restaurant is. My friend and I went to eat here the other night (my first time), and you can see crumbs scattered all over the tables from several feet away. 

We had to brush off our table with a napkin... and when we looked at the napkin there was a disgusting layer of black crap. This indicates that the tables are not PROPERLY cleaned. My suspicions were confirmed when we saw the bussers "cleaning" up after a group.. which consisted of using a *dry* paper towel to make a half-assed attempt at clearing off the crumbs. That's it. What the fuck?

Waitress was okay. She was attentive and not impolite, but I could not help feeling she was not happy to be at work. But hey, I can relate to that!

The food was great. I had the chicken tikka masala. It was heaven. I never wanted it to end. mmmmm. I don't care if it wasn't "authentic"- it was delicious.

I tried some of my friend's cheese pizza, which was yummy- not overwhelming or greasy like some "real" pizza can be. She also let me try some of her Taboule, and it was really great. 

All in all, great food, okay service, but it could really use some cleaning pointers from the health department.Do you ever just crave jalapeno & cilantro hummus? No? Well I do, and still recently new in my area of town so unfamiliar to all that is in my surroundings, so I checked the Yelp app for hummus and Pita Jungle showed up, and get this it's within 3 miles of my place, so this was a win win for me!

I knew what I wanted so I called my order in, I got a small side of jalapeno cilantro hummus with cucumbers and a chicken shawarma pita with garlic potatoes was told my order would be ready for pick up in 10 to 15 minutes.  Arrived at Pita Jungle, and have to say I like the setup of this place, and it seems to me that maybe each Pita Jungle is set up a little differently, which is cool, I like variety.

 Even the small hummus is enough to share between 2 people and the side of cucumber looked like it was maybe a whole cucumber and this side was delish, just what I was craving. The garlic potatoes are always a favorite with me at Pita Jungle but the chicken shawarma wasn't that great, I couldn't place my finger on but something was off so I didn't finish that. 

I can't really attest to service since I was a pick up only, but I was greeted by the hostess when I entered and showed were to get my order. Glad to have found Pita Jungle in my area, I'm sure I will be back.eh.

I was rather disappointed in the sound when I saw Digable Planets a couple years ago. Ladybug's (singer) cool-soothing voice was all muffled.

I did see Tegan and Sara a couple months ago and it was much better.

Oh and they shouldn't keep the floor to ceiling windows so damn clean!I have to say before seeing the AMAZING Sia at the Marquee last night I was nervous about all the bad reviews on here especially about the acoustics of the venue. 

So was it all that bad? Not really. Granted it wasn't sold out so there was plenty of space and never a line to get a drink which helped. Parking was $5 which wasn't a big deal and we got there in plenty of time to grab a space (made for a hyper quick escape at the end of the show!). Drinks for $7.50 for and $5 for a beer which again didn't seem over the top to me. 

The sound was a bit crappy I will admit and having seen Sia two years ago at the Hotel Congress in Tucson I can only hope she relocates her choice of AZ venue when she comes back. It wasn't so bad it ruined the evening and the mix got better as the set went on. 

Overall I've been to worse places around the country so if a band you like plays here give it a go.It was a bad experience with this place before I even got to the venue. I had bought tickets for Green Day the first time they were set to play in December. They canceled, and Luckyman (the ticket provider for Marquee), gave no hint of rescheduling or suggesting we hang on to our tickets. I thought I would lose my money if I didn't refund, so I got a refund. Three months later Green Day reschedules, and we're told that if we didn't refund our tickets, they would be good at the new show. Yeah, I had a tiny fit about that. However I did get a new ticket, but a little more consideration towards customers would be nice.

The night of the concert, I expected the line to get in to be long, and it was. However, there is no way it had to take 2 hours to get inside. I found out why when we finally reached the door. One table, in 4 sections (A-E, F-L, etc), and security desperately trying to wrangle hundreds of people to the correct line. Right in front of the entrance. So, my being a C last name, after I got my ticket I had to fight my way through 3 other lines to get inside the venue. Definitely could organize that a little better. A big name concert is no excuse.

Now there are good things to say. The venue itself is good. I liked the set up. It's bigger than you think, and there are no bad places to stand (side note- be prepared to stand. No seating at all). You will get a decent view of the stage. We stood by the control booth, and since it slopes down to the stage that was the best place for my short self to be. 

Their security was impressive too. I was rammed into by one very intoxicated person, and it was very obvious he could barely stand up. Within a minute security was there and taking him out. Good on you, Marquee. 

Once inside, the Marquee is a good place to see a show. It's also right off the light rail, so that is nice and convenient. They charge $7 for parking, so if you can light rail it do so. $4 for light rail and it supports Metro. Just beware what you could encounter leading up to showtime!All things considered, it's not a bad venue to watch a show.

The pros:

The sound is pretty good, wherever you happen to be standing. The visibility is also good even all the way in the back, unless you happen to be standing behind "Filming this with my iPhone" guy. I've been to some more violent shows here as well, and the security people do a pretty good job making sure nothing gets out of hand. The restrooms are clean and well-stocked, which is due in part to the attendant. He is basically watching to make sure no one destroys the bathroom or tries to light up in there, etc. One other thing: Luckyman is the ticket provider. Even though they still have a bunch of annoying fees, you can feel good knowing you did your part to stick it to Ticketmaster, which is one of the world's most evil companies.

The cons:

It's always too hot in there, which I think they do on purpose so people will buy water bottles. They also will tell you you can't bring various things inside that wouldn't even occur to you. As others have mentioned, bring your ID, your ticket, and some cash. Otherwise, you might be throwing away what you brought, or running back to your car.This was my second try at Ethiopian food in a week.  Wasn't quite as impressed with the dining experience as many though still a great place if you are ever wanting to at least try Ethiopian for your first time.

I ordered the ethnic stout and my partner in crime had the tea.  The stout was a few hops away from being an IPA, a little too much for me but the tea was very delicious after it cooled down from its molten plasma form to a more drinkable liquid.  We ordered the spicy combination along with the goat selection and brown lentils.  I'm a spicaholic and the berbere definitely gave each of the dishes a nice kick.  The beef dish was cubed just right for picking up in bite sized morsels but the chicken needed to get handled with with hands to tear pieces away.  The injera was really sticky and not quite dried out yet which is where the problems were later in the meal.  

After you get about halfway through your meal by scooping it up with the injera provided in the basket the rest is usually able to be eaten with the layer of injera below your food selections.  Because it was already so moist the moisture from the food completely disintegrated the injera as I tried to pick it up.  I had to order another basket of fresh injera in order to clean up the plate.  

In conclusion, great food but I definitely recommend ordering a second helping of injera right off the bat if you are ordering a platter for two or more people.Not my kind of food but the vegetarian options are available.First time at this restaurant yesterday. My husband and I were excited about trying this restaurants after reading good reviews on Yelp. But we got mixed feelings.

I liked this cute restaurant. It's clean and cozy and the people working there were nice and friendly to us. My husband enjoyed the light Ethiopian beer. 

But the food....that's the thing.
Some were good and some were not so good. We ordered a chef's combo and vegetarian combo. Both came with the crepe like Ethiopian bread and side salad. Each combo had 3-4 different dishes which were spicy chicken, cheese, collard green for the chef's combo and lentils, green beans, cabbage(w/potato&carrot) and collard green for the vegetarian combo. 

Chicken and lentils (spicy ones) were pretty good but most of the others had more or less the same kind of taste, salty and sour....yes, "salty and sour" explains their food. The cheese and bread had almost no taste for me. 
Overall, I got a feeling they were missing "taste".

For dessert, we shared a mango mousse cake which was home made and tasty. 

So my feeling is...if we choose right dishes, we can enjoy their food better, maybe? We do not eat beef or lamb, so they might be good. 

Will I recommend this place? I don't know...you can give a try. 
Will I go back to this place again? Maybe not. I will try somewhere else.My, my, my.... I can't believe so many people had crappy experiences with Gus's. It's a shame really. It's really big pizza, that's cheap and next to a college campus. I'm surprised I didn't see this place gleaming with 5-star reviews. A crappy experience is a crappy experience I guess though. 

Enough about that...

Gus's is one of the best places to grab pizza after drinking it up on Mill Ave. Since it takes a little bit more energy to get to than Slices does, the crowd is usually a bit smaller (though not any less drunk). The pizza is just pizza, it's not gourmet, it's not organic and it's definitely not meant to blow people's socks off. It's gigantic, it's cheap and, when loaded up with garlic powder, it hits the spot after making poor decisions at the bar. The wings at Gus's are also good and are best with extra wing sauce.

I've never really ordered from them so I can't say anything about those incidents, but Gus's is okay in my book...even if there is a nasty grammatical error in their name.Oh Gus'.  You are the stable of many a ASU student's diet.  And for that, I thank you.

Gus has a good selection of Pizza, Subs, and Wings.  They are very reasonably priced, and they have some fantastic lunch specials.

If you are in the mood for Pizza, then their best deal, by far, is their Lunch Pizza Special.  This can only be ordered in person, or over the phone, so do not try to do this on their online ordering.

Gus' serves a 1 topping Large Pizza for $4.99.  That's right.  A pizza that is actually made to order, not sitting in a hot plate over at Little Ceasers.  A full-blown pizza for just $4.99.  And this baby can feed plenty!  I have only once been able to split it among three people...  And we were all starving at the beginning.  

I would also recommend their Garlic Knots... These breadsticks-gone-twisted are covered in luscious garlic spread and parmesan cheese.  A must-have for those who love all things bread related.

The one downside is that it is fast food.  Shocking, right?!  This place does not have the highest quality food... But that is what you get when you aren't paying tons of money.

If you are looking for some decent pizza that will not empty your wallet, give Gus' a call.My best friend and I decided to give Khai Hoan a shot before a musical at the Gammage. Thank you fellow Yelpers for directing us to this unassuming little restaurant. 

I had the chicken pho with extra veggies,  but requested it bun style--broth on the side. Call me crazy (the waiter certainly looked at me as such), but I wasn't in the mood to splash pho all over my nice dress...yet I still wanted to try the broth. 

The pho came out piping hot. I was miffed by the absence of fresh basil and sprouts on the side. These essential veggies were fondly missed. 

The chicken was tender but a tad dry.  Broccoli, carrots and bok choi--cooked to perfection.  

I really like that the hoisin sauce has a thicker consistency than most pho restaurants.  It went perfect with Sriracha and lime. 

The entire meal was very reasonable.  Next time I'm trying the spring rolls and some Chinese food.Oh, The Alternative. Just as quickly as you've won me over, you've gone and disappointed me. What a  shame. I ordered business cards via e-mail and, unfortunately, they were not printed to my specifications. Okay, no big deal, mistakes happen. The problem that really irked me was how the staff handled the situation when I went to pick up my cards in-store.

The woman at the counter pretty much just shrugged off the error. I told her things weren't right and explained my intended order. It was clear that I was very dissatisfied and no one seemed to care. Her response to my concerns? "Try to make sure you're more clear next time."

Um?

It wasn't my fault that the order was printed incorrectly - the misunderstanding was on their end, yet I wasn't even offered an apology for the mix-up.

The Alternative's services are very quick and fairly cheap, and Kim (who I've worked with both times) is absolutely wonderful. She works hard to keep customers satisfied and e-mailed me back right away regarding the issues I encountered. I did appreciate that, hence the 3 stars. But, the customer service behind the counter was enough to convince me they definitely don't deserve the 5 star review I left last time.There's something oddly charming about this place. My 2nd experience happened this past weekend - Sunday breakfast at 10 a.m. As I pulled up in my car, I could tell the place was quite popular. I sensed a wait list. I walked in, put down my name and took a seat outside on of their benches. The wait wasn't long - perhaps 5 minutes - and I was shortly shown to my table for two. Few minutes later, my Breakest Buddy showed up. We had concluded to call this "brunch" since it was a compromise between breakfast and lunch time. In any case, breakfast foods were on the mind and my belly was ready. 

Coffee first, please. 

The waitress, you could tell, was rather busy. I didn't mind that, but I did mind her spilling my coffee each time she poured more. Her rush wasn't coupled with friendly pauses, and I felt like I was more of an inconvenience than a patron. In any case, we ordered "brunch" and chatted it up. It's not every day I roll out of bed before 10 a.m. on the weekend. This was a special occassion; one well worth it. But, sadly, not because of the breakfast. 

The eggs were rubbery and the muffin was hard to swallow without honey. The cottage cheese was good, but how can you screw up that? Yes, I ordered the Hot Body Breakfast. So sue me. My friend ordered panckakes with eggs and bacon. Only half was eaten. 

You know, there's something oddly charming about this place. It's a warm cafe, reminiscient of a small town mom & pop establishment. It probably is, and the fact that it's thrown near ASU makes it the preferred after-hang over joint. I can see how rubbery eggs and greasy pork would suit one's belly after a booze fest. But, it's not ideal for the belly without a drop of liquor coating the stomach lining. 

I used the bathroom, too. Talk about a tiny walkway stuffed with clutter, like high chairs and cordless vacuums. Again, it's charming in a home-for-breakfast kind of way. 

It almost reminds me of Shortcakes. Almost, although Shortcakes is in a train car and has, let's face it, the best after bar and in-the-mood-for-cheap-food appeal. Sadly, it's back near OSU in Stillwater. I miss Shortcakes. 

Harlow's wasn't memorable to me. That's probably why I've only been here twice in my life.

Sidebar: I wouldn't call this place "cheap." With plates averaging around 8-10$, that's quite the purse punch that should be met with some delicious raves and reviews. Sadly, to me, it's not worth the moolah.Movie themed in decor, with lots of booths, and overall is a throw back to a casual diner 40+ years ago.  Traditional breakfast favorites.  Nothing we had was bad, but nothing great either.  Worth trying.Had a traditional scrambled/hash browns/bacon/toast/juice breakfast and while I wasn't blown away I don't have anything negative to report.  The hash browns were really just diced potatoes that sat in the pan until browned and weren't all that flavorful, while the bacon was definitely some of the best I have ever had.  It was thick cut and full of all that bacony goodness.

Side note:  The wait staff is above average in attractiveness so if that matters to you, there you go.Talk about fast! With in 30 seconds of placing my lunch order I had a salad in front of me. 30 seconds later my sandwich arrived. Needless to say, the service here is lightning fast.I feel like a complete douche giving Harlow's 3 stars as all the reviews I am reading are 4 and 5 stars, super warm and exciting and just filled with love for this place. I came here on a Saturday afternoon (1pm) for Brunch after being fed up with waiting for a table at another brunch spot. With nothing in my stomach and the hunger of an angry Hulk, I pretty much anticipated to devour and love any type of food-related substance in my vicinity.

The good thing about Harlow's is that their wait time is rather short and their bar is immediate availability (which I definitely appreciated). It full-on diner style feel AND food, so you can definitely tell that the customers are there for the food and not the fancy ambiance. To Harlow's (and my) misfortune, we came here because my Tempe-native friend claimed they have the best French Toast that has ever touched his lips in his entire existence (seriously, he described almost in a pornographic way), and with that, I said "TAKE ME THERE".

I went for their 'signature' breakfast dishes and ordered the Cisqo (quick! queue in The Thong Song!): 4 half-slices of french toast, 1 sausage patty and 2 eggs (poached). Everything was arranged separately, as if together it wouldn't make a cohesive meal. The eggs were stacked together in a cup and tasted alright, the sausage patty was MEH and the french toast.. (dun dun duuun), the french toast was pretty average. And hear me out here, i'm not giving it 3 stars before its not the most orgasmic-holy-shit-i-just-jizzed-my-pants-they're-so-good french toast, I gave it 3 stars because it was pretty mediocre french toast comparable to a fast food chain or me while cooking drunk in the kitchen. The bread was a little dry, all I could taste was a simple egg batter (no cinnamon or spices) and the syrup that was served along side tasted store-bought. 

My little ray of hope is that I think had I ordered something different, I would have had a better chance of giving it a 4 star review. My friend's chorizo and egg dish, for example, had excellent flavor and seemed to be a great hangover cure/super hearty meal. My other friend's ham omelette with house potatoes was pretty bland and did not get particularly better with 2 gallons of Cholula.  

Our server was nice and got us our checks without us even asking for them or finishing our meals. Food turnaround time was pretty speedy too, which is probably why they are so good at keeping their wait times short. Hip Hip, Hooray?I love putting balls into holes.

There are just so many ways to do that here. I like all the different obstacles and can be rather challenging at times.

I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded. I had an older couple in front of us and they were moving along at a great pace but the group ahead of them were a bunch of obnoxious teens who just took so long! It was also pretty hard to find our balls because it was so dark and we had to keep running back to get replacement balls. 

The different courses were fun though. It one was different and presented a special challenge. I think there were 10-12 different courses but if you're awesome at mini golf, like me, it could go by really fast.

A fun place to slap some balls around but a lil' creepy with lack of lighting.I heard great things about Oregano's so I had to check it out.  It's fairly good pizza, I think, but I don't think it was particularly cheap (just average prices).  The margarita I got in a moment of insanity was horrible but at least it was fairly strong.  We showed up at 4:30 PM and didn't have to wait for a table, but waited an hour from the time we ordered to get our pizza (a pan and a thin crust).  People were waiting for tables before 6 PM.  Had to get the pizookie at a friend's recommendation.  Definitely yummy but not irresistibly so.  I'm glad to have gone, and I'd recommend it for someone new to check out, but I don't think I'd ever go back.  The food is good and reasonably priced but not worth the hour wait for cooking plus the 1-4 hr wait just to be seated.  If I did go back, it would only be on an off-hour.Quite frankly its not worth the wait. Oreganos isn't bad but by no means should anyone wait 45+ minutes for a table to eat here. If I drive in and see a mass of people sitting outside waiting for a table I keep driving. At least they expanded their parking a few years ago, that was a major plus. If it isnt busy, lol, I know its always busy, then check it out, otherwise there are many other better options in Tempe.I love Dunkin Donuts, I really really do. When they finally came down here I was so excited cuz I grew up going there back east.

The service at this location though, lacks.

The counter people are always "deep" in conversation while taking orders, making them ssllooww. It also causes them to forget things you order and make mistakes w/ the things they give you.

If youre in a rush, dont go here. If there isnt too bad of a line, do.I love dropping by for a few donuts for breakfast throughout the week, and a large iced coffee.

They make the iced coffee perfectly. Not too much sugar, not too much cream.

Their donuts tend to be hit or miss. While I almost always go there at the same time (just after lunch), their donuts are either super fresh, or pretty old from early in the morning. It's a bit of a gamble as to whether the donuts will be soft and delicious or a bit stale.

Either way, the service is fine, it's never crowded, and as far as Dunkin Donuts go, it's clean and gets the job done.Those looking for a solid hotel in close proximity to the ASU campus need look no further. At around $150 a night, Mission Plams provides a decent hotel experience at a fairly decent cost, close to campus. 

Unfortuantely, three clubs reside directly across the street, so if you are looking for a good night's sleep, ask for a room that is not on the front of the hotel. Instead, try to get something overlooking the beautiful palm tree filled courtyard. 

The showers are fantastic, a Destination Hotels staple. And, the brunch features a great omlette bar, and fresh fruit galore. Eat under the sun and palm trees in the courtyard and you'll feel like you might be in paradise :)This Fedex Office is smaller than most, and is mostly geared for making copies for students (it is near ASU). 

It also gets pretty busy with foreign students shipping off all things Stateside to their foreign friends and relatives, like ASU T-Shirts so their friends and family can look cool and the student can try to prove to his/her parents that he didn't flunk out and is still enrolled. 

Place is a little cramped, but the staff is knowledgeable and efficient, if not pleasant.Beer is gooood! and comes in a goood size. The food? not that good, specially if you are used to the food of places like 4 peaks.

DEcoration inside looks like an old, and almost stinky place, so if you are looking something fancy...go northern. Guess by night and drunk, ppl just don't care where they are sitting!Called in my order and had a coupon in College Times for $9.99 large one-topping and 1 liter of soda. The pizza was decent, not in top 10 though, but was foldable and was worth the money. It did better when it was reheated also. Also added a large salad with Italian dressing which was probably made in the morning, but everything was still fresh (a few cukes, tomatoes and lettuce). Slice of Sicily better, but with coupon, this pie is worthy if your in the area.Perfect venue for local live music without the festival feel. Every final Friday of the month always provides an eclectic mix of art, music and people. Nice getaway from the pretentious hipsters and drunken freshman. Bartenders are a bit prickly, but you learn how to be patient. This place does not serve food, only on final Fridays when the BBQ is set up by a vendor. Never a dress code and plenty of free street parking if you don't mind taking a little stroll. Experience The Sail Inn before it closes for good.Good tandoori chicken.  Skip the bland lamb curry.  Spinach curry was delicious; eat it with basmati rice.  Excellent samosas.  Heavenly gulab jamun.  The carrot squares were delicious, as well.  Wash it all down with chai.  $9 lunch buffet.  Can't wait to try again!OK, it's been a while since I had a fast food burger, but it was moving day for my lovely daughter Whitney, yesterday.
The menu selection for moving day lunch is "bag of burgers" for the moving crew, of which I was a part.
If you are going to do chain, drive through burgers, you can do far worse than Whataburger (I mean you MickieD, and you too, Burger King!).
I like the fact that Whataburger toasts the buns and smears on a little butter flavored...something, grease, oil, lard...I have no idea, but it adds to the taste and doesn't make me ill, so thumbs up! They don't get the order wrong any more often than any other drive through place, and when they do, they have remade the order without attitude, so that's nice.
Over the years, I have tried a couple of other things on their menu, and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu. Again, far superior to some of their national competitors.
Good for the moving day "bag of burgers", but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there (BTW, when is Lucky Boy going to put a place in Old Town Scottsdale?).As a beginning rock climber, I don't have much to compare it to. I thought it was a fun experience that I would definitely do again. The equipment was durable and safe and after watching a demonstration video, they personally showed you how to use it appropriately.
However, as soon as I walked in the door, I wasn't impressed with the unwelcoming staff. All 4 of the employees that I interacted with were not very personable. As a new climber, I appreciated any support and help if I was doing something wrong. Instead of handling the situation in a way that expressed support, they made you feel like an idiot. 
While I would probably go back because it's close to my house and I enjoyed rock climbing, I'd rather drive a further distance for friendlier people that want to encourage you.This place is a lot of fun. Be sure and have your expectation switch shut off though. If you have never been here before then there are a few things you must know

 -Expect bar quality food. I personally found it satisfactory but those who go in expecting way more might be disappointed.

-Expect to be squished. They pack you in like sardines. I understand they need to fit as many as possible but it does take on a new extreme. 

-Drinks, pricey.  Once again, they gotta make their money. Drinks are kinda rough on wallet but I really enjoyed them.

-Customer service blows. I don't go for the service.

   Have had a few great experiences there and I have really enjoyed the talent. My reason for the 4 stars is because the experience I had in line (people cutting, smoking, the line lasted forever, and the trouble I had getting a drink (45mins after I walked in before I got a drink)  

 Overall it's a pretty cool experience if you have never been. I still like to go for some of my favorite comics but I don't take advantage of free shows because after the two drink minimum and service fees I still ended up paying about $50.we decided to give this place a whirl for a few brews and food before heading to the celeberty theater for a show. we found street parking across the street.......score. we went in and took a seat just inside the door. we sat there for a few minutes before our very pleasent wait person came over she took our drink order and came back within a few minutes again. we went ahead and ordered the guiness barbque sauce wings ,fish nuggetts w/chips and for a potato overkill the skins as well all the food was very tasty . she informed us that a wait person had called in ill and that was why the service was a little slow.....not that i ask because i thought the service was just fine for as busy as it was...................we will add a 1/2 star just for thatPros: They have Strongbow. It's a wimpy cider but I still love it.
- GREAT hamburgers. I love them much more than their Shepherd's Pie.

If you go there before 10, you won't get to hear the live music but at least you'll avoid the mass of drunk college kids swarming outside. 

It's a bit more for the out of college crowd but perhaps that's why I like it.Don't tell my husband I'm giving Rula Bula 3 stars.  He thinks it deserves 4.  But he should try earning his little Elite badge and write his own review I say.

After Zoolights fell through on Saturday night (not interested in walking from a parking lot in Chandler to get there), we found ourselves on Mill, which is actually only the 2nd time I've ever been on Mill.  My husband, on the other hand, had too many months unsupervised in the Valley before I joined him, and has apparently visited many of these fine establishments, including Rula Bula.

Not being a huge fan of Irish food, or beer for that matter, I decided this would be the 1 in 100 dining experiences I let him choose.  I loved  the interior I must say.  And the menu is not so bad either.  If I could find quesadillas and hot wings in Ireland, I might just visit.  But so as to not completely humiliate my husband, I ordered a cider, rather than a margarita, and fish 'n chips.  The cider was perfect, not too sweet.  If only beer should taste this good...

The fish (cod) was perfectly cooked and the batter was flavorful.  I just wish it was a little more crispy.  Perhaps it didn't hold up to my splash of vinegar.  The chips were near perfect, except I wish the fish hadn't been plopped on top as it caused them to lose their crispiness, too.

I would be happy to come back to Rula Bula again.  They have a great patio with a bar out there as well.  But I think I'll stick to the time of year when ASU is not in session.  I have a sneaking suspicion this place is a different beast when school starts back up.The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street.

I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.

It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here. 

FUN.

To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.

I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. It's just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night.Fun outdoor patio but a lot of bees and wasps.  be careful where you sit.  It is a great location, right off of mill and next to the Tempe Mission palms.  the food is solid, potato and fried foodstuff heavy.  The drinks are good, but i warn you that it gets crowded and depending on your server, you may get hit or miss service.  It pays to carry cash as they are not fond of splitting checks.  Great people watching, you get college students, street urchins, renaissance festival types, guys in suits, couples breaking up...you name it.  fun times!  Awesome for day drinking in good weather.The good: 
Guinness tastes better here for some reason 
Bar imported from Ireland is cool 
great location with big outdoor area 


The eh factor: 
food is only OK 
cover charge on weekends due to lame bandsI did like the ambiance of this place...We sat outside weather was awesome. We ordered a bottle of wine. 

We had the Irish Chips with melted cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeños,
sour cream and chipotle pepper sauce., it was actually very good. I've never had it with potatoes! Yumm! The Buffalo Wings were BOMB! Did I mention that the Chips were off the hook! Feed me potato's!!!!

Downside:

The waiter was way chatty...and a little irritating. Before we ordered the bottle of wine I selected a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, it was gross. I asked him to give me another selection and he clearly stated, "My manager won't let me take it back I need to charge you for it." I was in shock...I couldn't believe it so I started laughing. 
At that point I told him to bring me a bottle of what my GF was drinking since it was way better and forget about the whole nasty glass of wine. It's all in the delivery of the message dude...I don't care if you charge me for it. At least go and pretend to talk to your manager then tell me you can't. Duh, It's called customer service. You know the line of work your in....Just Sayin!I stopped in with a friend after reading about how awesome this place was. Upon entering, I noticed another good friend of mine sitting at a table, waiting for the lunch he had ordered. He had been waiting for 15 minutes for his sandwich, and it took another 10 for it to arrive. Not a good sign! 25 minutes for a sandwich! They were busy..but he didn't order anything crazy. 

It was hot inside. The first thing I notice when I walk into a building, is how comfortable the temperature is. Green made me sweat.

I ordered an iced latte which was amazing. To eat, I ordered the coconut curry with chikn. The buddy I brought along, ordered the same thing, but with crispy tofu. It took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table..The potatoes in this dish were perfectly cooked, and tasty. Everything else in my bowl was mediocre...and actually kind of bland. The friend we ran into said Green's menu items are hit or miss. I will give it another try someday.I have been to Green on several occasions and I have never been as impressed as my friends. The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good, but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens. The green burger was okay but I was surprised by how thin the patty was.

I am in love with their french fries, however! They are incredibly tasty, whether plain as a side or as an appetizer as the vegan chili fries (by far the best item of their menu!).

The tsoynamis are delicious no matter what flavor you get and that is definitely a selling point!I am here to tell you that my relationship with Green is like a revolving door. I'm vegetarian, I want good vegetarian food, I go to Green, I find it adequate but not overwhelmingly amazing, and yet... I keep going back. I'm still holding out hope that Green will one day knock my socks off, it just hasn't happened yet.

That last two times I have gone, my food has been cold, especially the french fries. Cold french fries are not good, people. Nor are they difficult to make. Last time I got the spicy po-boy, which I found a little bit too spicy, and overly salty. The bowls are better, I love the thai peanut bowl, it's one of my favorites! Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.

I've been a bit disappointed lately, but I will keep going back for the concept, the cool couches, the awesome drink and ice cream selections... what can I say? It's a vegetarian dream.This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that.I used to love their Mexicali burger, but the new menu replaced it with a lesser burger. I haven't been back since. I sincerely hope the Mexicali burger makes a comeback.3.5 stars

The staff was very friendly and seemed pretty fast.

Ordered the Buffalo wings which were small but pretty good (and pretty close to a meaty texture). I ordered the mooshu po boy which was kind of disappointing and definitely not worth the price. I've been to plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants and don't mind paying more money for quality food, but I just felt I've had better.This location is closing as of Monday, January 31, 2011... :(This is near my girlfriend's house or I bet I'd never go here. The food is typical diner fare but what floors me is how long we had to wait. We've gone twice now on Saturday late mornings and it's never busy, which bothers me that it takes so long. The first time it took 20 minutes to get our food and there were people only at maybe 4 tables. The breakfast food was very standard. The second time there were people at two tables. The food was piping hot and came quickly but when it was time to leave we couldn't find our waiter and had to wait 10 minutes. Finally we went up to pay at the cashier and she went to find our waiter who screwed up the checks three times before we could finally pay.Good food great service.The majority of my early sexual escapades were spent here, and I have bittersweet memories of this place. This location is a nice, cheap hotel in which to spend a night or two. The rooms are kept clean enough and there are a few sketchy people, but hey, it's Tempe. There's sketchy people everywhere. If you want a bed for a bargain, stay here and save some money. Who needs some fancy inn anyway?Quality local sports bar with decent food, reasonable drink prices, $2.50 Modelo and Negro Modelo on Sundays, good staff, and enough local flavor to feel the right amount of divyness. 

The staff puts up with a fair amount, but for the most part, they are always smiling...with a few exceptions. No massive TV, but a very good number of TVs (you won't miss anything), including an outdoor bar and nice sized patio with TVs, warmers, fire pits, ping pong, and bean bag toss (or whatever you tossers call it these days). Whether you are watching AFL/Aussie Rules (which you should for the most amazing action outside of the NFL) or the Packers beat the Bears, this is a good spot. 

And really, even if you are big sweaty Pats fan...they will change the TV to your game, so, don't get chowda in your stache and try to wait until it is a few minutes or so before kickoff until you turn into a raving lunatic looking like you just got off the boat in Gloucester...Just a thought, not a sermon. 

The cheese steaks are the focus of the menu, with sandwiches and typical bar food. You may not win a fight with a Philly native, but the cheese steaks are good, with ample variety and upgrades. 

And, if you need a reminder, there is a breath alcohol machine by the bathroom. Even better, enjoy your day, night, morning...and save your change (and more) and get a cab.We had such a sweet waitress and some great drinks, and their curly fries and garlic fries are great, but the phillys were a flop compared to Corleone's and forefather's...  Total bummer, I would come back for a fun time, but I will be ordering something else...The bf saw a groupon for this and asked me jokingly to call in sick for a day of waterpark fun. I (being the spontaneous person I am) said "let's do it!" I am from California so I have been to my fair share of waterparks growing up. The one's in Cali are a lot bigger with a lot more rides and attractions. I must say I still had a great time coming here. We hit all the slides multiple times, and since it was in the middle of the week it wasn't too crowded. The wave pool is pretty interesting since it consists of one large wave that comes every couple of minutes, not like what I had seen at other waterparks where a number of waves comes periodically. It was also strange to me that we had to pay for rafts, I don't remember ever doing that anywhere else. I also missed my favorite "lazy river" that is at every waterpark I've been to. But other than that there is a good time to be had. I don't know if I would go back without a groupon but I recommend giving it a try especially if you have young kids.Of the watermarks in the valley, we've enjoyed this the most. Although there have been a few downsides. It seems that the past 3. Years we've had season passes the quality of the park has declined. There seems to be more areas that need repair and cleaning each year. I'd like to see the owners re-invest in the building and repair of the water walk-ways as well as all the cracks in concrete.

Also, they need to revisit their pricing strategy. Paying $3 for a 3 month old feels like being nickel n dime'd.

On the side, their French fries are amazing and they give you an ability to buy a foundation drink cup to only pay $1 for refills which is a plus.

We'll continue to go, but hope they consider our feedback.Came on a Groupon so it was definitely worth the price, although at the regular ($30/pp) I'm not sure it would have seemed as great. 

The concessions weren't too overpriced considering the size of the meals. The secret winner here are the fries- SO GOOD! Nice and small and crispy without being dry. 

They need a little better consistency and display of the rules. Our daughter got smacked with the short stick pretty hard, but we are a swimming family. Both husband and I were on swim teams growing up and our daughter is an excellent swimmer. The first time we went in the wave pool no one said anything to/about her height (about 43" at almost 7 years old). The second time there was someone at the entrance with a measuring stick and told her she had to wear a life jacket for being under 48". She was very upset and felt like a baby. The only sign posted outside the wave pool says non-swimmers must be accompanied by a parent and can not go past the 3ft mark. They need to post their actual requirements and have consistency with the lifeguards monitoring entry & height requirements. There was a pretty good variety of slides that she was able to ride for her height, though. Overall it was a good time.We started with the bruschetta and order the ravioli with spinach and red sauce. The veal was a little bland and the spinach egg drop soup was ok. but it was yummy. Service was greatl. Super helpful with suggestions.I love it for being a Frank Lloyd Wright building... That's about it.  The seating is not good, the snacks are lacking variety. The 1:1 ratio of men to women's bathrooms is a joke. I will be happy when we move away to a city with a real venue that can support off-broadway the way it should be supported.I've had season tickets to the Broadway Series here for more years than I care to admit.  Cons: Parking in the main lot can be an issue if you get there with less than 30 minutes to showtime and you will get directed to one of the overflow lots that will require a bit of a hike.  It's looking a little worn and needs a thorough sprucing up.  The sound can be horrid depending upon the production.  Pros: They are the only venue in the city to get national tours.  The bar has a no tip policy.  The cafe has relatively decent tasting pack and go meals.  They offer cast discussions at some performances.  The staff is very helpful and responsive to the needs of their guests.I went here on a friday night, and the place gradually got more and more busy. By the time we left at midnight, it was really packed. The pool table area was pretty crowded, but there was enough space to play.

The only complaint I have about Cue Club, was that the cocktail waitress only came by maybe once an hour. We went searching for her pretty often. When it was time to leave and close out our checks, it took close to a half hour to find her and get it settled. Kind of annoying.

The drinks were good, and pretty cheap. The music was loud enough to dance, and I liked the projection screens playing the music videos.I have since returned to Rosita's after my bad/mediocre experience and it seems to be just fine.  Just fine as in it would be amazing if located in a northern state, but here in Arizona where delicious Mexican food is plentiful, it doesn't stand out.  

I appreciate that they offer two types of beans rather than just the standard refried variety.  The service and food have been fine lately.This place kind of scares me.  It used to be scarier, but right now it's still a little odd.  When you walk in, it'll be silent for a long time, no one there.  It makes me think of if The Shining took place in an Asian restaurant.  You hear a strange rattling, rustling of pages or maybe fingers running along wooden bars.

You peak over the counter and there's a baby in a crib behind a partition.  Okay.  Bringing a baby to work is fine, but where are you?  You ring the bell on the counter and maybe a minute later a really sleepy, but pleasant enough gentleman will take your order.

There used to be this girl who worked there who had a permanent snarl on her face, a wrinkled nose and upturned, pissed-off lip.  She might not have been making a face, she might have just... you know, just looked that way, but she terrified me.  

The food is overall pretty decent.  I mean, it's not earth shattering but it's Pan-Asian Cuisine.  It's got broccoli, rice and meat served with sweet and sour sauce.  The prices are cheap and you end up getting a lot, too.

The lights flicker in there like crazy so it's best to get your order to go or else you'll end up feeling pretty nauseous.Delivery was delish.First visit. The chicken curry was great. No alot of sauce but lots of veggies and chicken and had a little kick to it. Unfortunately the chicken teriyaki was a disappointment. I think they forgot the sauce. Literally a box full of large chunks of tender chicken with rice on side but no sauce. There was a little in the bottom but by the third piece it dissipated. Not sure if ill order again. Maybe ill break down one of these nights for a hunan binge. Ill keep you updated.This place seems like a hole in wall but the food is very good and modest. They have chicken or steak. This chicken is red on the outside and the flavor is great. You can get plates or meals. You get tortillas, some plain salsa, cabbage that is very good, and your meat. I've only been here a few times but if you want something casual and feel like something yummy you can eat with your hands I would recommend it. The prices are very reasonable. You can eat here or take it to go.Don't know why it got such good reviews.  It was just ok.  Chicken was dry.  It was cheap though.Upon the rave reviews, I went to buy food for my old black cat.  Their cat food and supplies aren't as plentiful as their dog and horse stuff.  Service was ok; the young man who helped me just sorta pointed to the one and only bag of food that was for "mature cats."

Nevertheless, I always prefer supporting local businesses than the faceless corporate boxstores, so I'll buy more of the reasonably priced premium cat food here when Hopey gobbles up her 8 lbs of food.+3 stars because it's the only feed/tack store for horses I've seen in Tempe and does carry some good brands of food with great nutritional content.
- 1 star because the dog toy selection was limited, extremely overpriced, and they carried nothing "basic"; i.e., they had Nylabone brand but only the weirder toys, no good ole' original chew bones.
- 1 star for the weirdness of the employees. 

I went in today to buy food for my new German Shepherd pup and my cat. I knew what brands of food and chew toys I wanted, didn't need help, yada yada.

I entered into the dog toy room and heard a boisterous conversation in a room adjacent, which instantly dropped to hushed voices. Two guys came out and just said "Hi". I said hello back. The next 30 seconds went like this: as I tried to browse, one proceeded to stare at me like a deer in headlights, and the other looked me up and down, feet to shoulders, twice. Feeling like *I* should be asking *them* if I could help them,  I looked at them and raised an eyebrow. The looker-upper-downer quickly asked if he could help me. I said "No, I've got it, thanks" and they vanished. 

Hushed conversation and laughter resumed. 10 seconds later, another fellow came out, appearing to have been shoved out the door, and said to let him know if I needed help. Then HE vanished back into the room.

Weirded out, I left at that point, and as I walked past the room, they all went into silence again.

I am still confused as to what that was about, and have narrowed it down to that I was either being laughed at for some newly manifested physical deformity/stray unshaved leg hairs/whatever, or they employ awkward dudes who turn into 8th grade boys when confronted with a girl. 

Either way, I wasn't impressed, and took my business elsewhere. Sorry, dudes.This place is once of those pizzas places that are off the regular beaten path. It has its own character and is a place people should test out if they are pizza lovers.. 

For me it was okay.. I got the meatball calzone at the suggestion of one of my friends.. It was good typical calzone, the crust/bread was the best part. The sauce was a little generic but I liked that they gave your a side of it, cheese was plentiful, meatball tasty.. .. 

Only thing I was fan was too much ricotta cheese, I can handle a ricotta but we're talking about mouthfuls of ricotta, over and over.. but overall it was okay, not the best pizza place ever but I'd go againAfter reading some of the previous reviews, I had to give this place a try . . . While it wasn't Bad . . . It wasn't Great . . . just kind of BLAH.

Small and homey with a coupple of outside tables . . . not big on the order at the window opening in the wall though.  I ordered the Otto Calzone (my 3 choices - Pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers) . . . when it arrived at our table it was pretty big.  The problem was it was mostly air inside . . . and the pepperoni was missing.  What I did have was a pretty good mushroom and green pepper calzone with burnt ends.

Would I come back . . . possibly . . . but it most likely would not be my first choice.So I decided to finally pull the trigger and order from Ottos. I got the ravioli and pizza with a ceases... The salad was whatever's nothing special about it at all. The pizza was good but the crust well it's different... The toppings and sauce were tasty. I liked the crust but I prefer a thicker crust I guess. The raviolis were good. They were by far my favorite thing ordered. Delivery was really fast but they gave me no utensils... Or napkins... Or condiments like cheese and peppers...  Overall decent food at a decent price...If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.
 I'm so sorry to do this. I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the "yogurt soda" . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!
 Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.
 Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!! 
Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor.
Baba Gahnoush: OK.........
Hummus: OK.......
(Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items)
Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up. 
I thought it was cool that they sold prayer mat's. The service is ok, nothing bad and nothing over the top.The staff always seem annoyed to see you, like you're interrupting them. On many occasions, it seems like their friends are hanging out there behind the desk and they are much more focused on their conversation than the customer standing in front of them. Also I've come in an hour before close and had to wait for a super bed. There are at least four in that place, and there were no customers. Is the staff just too lazy to keep more than one running? Not sure. But on several occasions I have had to wait more than a few minutes for a bed when they weren't busy, and a few times I have just left because I really didn't have time to wait. :/
Prices are average. But, staff doesn't seem too interested in making a sale. I went here for 7 months until I was offered a package.  But my main complaint is the staff. A shame because if they were more focused on customer service, I would definitely rate higher. What happened to the thin blonde with the big smile who worked here last year?! She was great!

EDIT: The staff is still far more focused of socializing with their friends than helping customers. I came in the other day and the desk girl's friends were blocking the front desk. Making me wait behind them. Really?! I think management really needs to look into their staff and their behavior. This is your job, not social hour. Not to mention, attention should be paid to what they are doing. I came in one day, and asked specifically to do 7 minutes and the girl set it for 9. Being under the impression that my bed was set for the correct time, I laid down and relaxed. I ended up very burned the next day. :(

EDIT (agaiiiin)
Okay, so I'm bumping this place up a star because it seems like the customer service has really rallied and changed for the better (not everyone, but the girls who are there in the evenings seem to have). I really hope this stays because I really like the location and the beds!I finally ate lunch here after not being able to get decent parking for Quiznos on Mill Ave.  My coworker and I were starving and needed a place to shoot the shit so we decided to give it a try.  I really did enjoy the patio area.  The weather was amazing and I had cabin fever from being stuck in my office all morning attending boring meetings.  They do hand out the free chips and salsa (glad it was free b/c they weren't tasty enough to actually pay for).  I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a good portion and I didn't get sick so I was happy.  The wait staff seemed so busy yet there weren't that many people in the restaurant but we are talking about a college crew so I can forgive them for their lack of detail and attention.  
Macayos isn't my favorite "Cantina" but I'm sure it will hit the spot on another beautiful day when I need to unwind in the warm sun.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on the open patio, good parking and the fact I didn't have to ride the porcelain bus later that day.Wonderful atmosphere, but food is nothing special!I am a big fan of American Mexican food so I frequent this place often when I am in the Tempe area and since I like Tempe Town Lake I am there often.  This place has an awesome outdoor patio bar and seating area and is convienently located next to a light rail stop. The inside decor is fabulous and the piece de resistance is the chandelier made from Corona bottles.

The menu is comprised of your traditional mexican dishes like tacos, chimichangas, burritos and so much more. I have tried numerous items from the menu but sadly have not found anything that wows me so much that I want to eat it every time I go.  I advise to ask for the spicy salsa when they bring you your chips and salsa. 

The downside to this restaurant is that the service is never consistent. More times than not I get seated in a location that everyone forgets about and so it takes forever to be waited on.  Often times when I request a special order of no tomatoes, since I really don't like them in most of my food, I still get them served with my meal anyway.  Despite these inconveniences I still return.generally i do not take my bike into the shop for repairs
for the most part these can be done at home or down the street @ bike saviours for pennys on the $
and in no way would i advise any to buy a bike from a bike store
HOWEVER
i realize many folks do not know how to work on their bicycles, and it is for you unlucky ignorant and blissfull riders that i write
This Tempe Bike location is great, plus you can grab a slice of pizza next door while you wait
the staff is very friendly and helpful, and wont condescend to you should you know next to zero about bicycles
whenever my ex gf thrashed her fancy fixed gear and needed a new tube or wheel or any little tweak done really they treated her fair and kind. I liked the little australian dude that worked here, but apparently he moved. i actually found out later that he was next door neighbor to one of my good friends, small world.
Tempe Bikes is fast, friendly, and reliable.I will certainly admit that they do good work. With that said, they charge $6 for ANY and EVERY adjustment, even if that is just tightening a nut. Also, they are a bit pretentious. I like a bike shop that makes you feel welcomed, that chat with you, and is kind and chill. If you don't really care about any of that and just want your bike fixed well for an above average price, then have at it.I'm a fan of all coffee houses. I like the music, the smell, and the people who congregate at these locations. The best thing to me about this particular location, is the outside 'dining' - you see, I enjoy watching people on there way to things, or coming back from things...or even the few who have not-a-thing going on at all. The Mill Ave Starbucks provides a great venue (and even a good drink here or there). So, on the weekends you might find me sipping a drink and watching the people go by on Mill. 

P.S. for all those people watchers, the weekends are the best because that is when the real freaks come out!Not the best UO I've been too, but definitely a good sized one.  If I went to school as ASU, I would be in love with Mills Ave, as there are cute shops all along the street. 

This UO is just the same as any other, decent home selection, clothing, selection, as well as shoes selection.  The thing this store lacks is customer service as no one greeted me the entire time I was in the store, which was an entire 30 minutes.  After the first 15 I just give up when no one acknowledges me and my spending power!Liked the place..had the type of fabric i was looking for, just not the color.  must have patience to go through the fabrics since its some what orgazined.We've been eating at La Fonda since I was about 7 years old, and believe me, that was a long time ago!

Their food has always been pretty good, their chips freshly made and served hot most of the time and their servers frenquently have the kind of attitude of "Yeah honey what'll have?".

I am very pleased they are still in business after all of these years, and even expanding to new locations. But don't look to La Fonda if you're searching from true Mexican food. They are very good "Americanized" Mexican cuisine, but there is nothing here that will surprise you very much.

Don't get me wrong, I love this place, but let's be honest, it's very generic although it is done quite well. All of their options are tasty and plentiful. (The Nachos Grande are enough for 4 people easily.)

You'll like it I promise, they just wont be winning any awards for originality any time soon.It's a drive thru liquor store.  What can be wrong with that?  Absolutely nothing!  Except for the inflated prices, which some of the other reviews mentioned.So I went here for lunch today for the first time, which is ridiculous because my program is located directly east of this place. I ordered a sandwich... can't remember the name..... it had steak, onion, jalapenos, and a whole lot of lettuce.... oh and a yogurt feta sauce. The guy who was working there was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was good, but I thought they went heavy on the sauce and the shredded lettuce.... half the sandwich was lettuce, that was not so good. The meat, however, was tasty and so was the sauce (thanks for the recommendation guy who works behind the counter!). I also got a cute mini chocolate chip cookie!!! Woot. I would definitely come back here again, but I might order something else...I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.

I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.I'm torn between a 3.5 and 4 star rating.  The pizza here is amazing, seriously. As I was eating it, I felt like I was in the scene with the corn on the cob in "What about Bob".  Spinato's has incredible pizza, the ingredients and sauce were spot on and rich in flavor.  Also this place has crushed ice, which I just love!!  

However, there were a few things that I didn't like about the place.  For one, it's tiny, meaning wait time will usually be a factor.  Once we finally were sat, it was at a really small table right in the middle of the room; I prefer a bit more of an intimate setting.  Our server was nice but not especially quick or observant; forgetting plates and silverware.  Our mixed iceberg/spinach salad was nothing to write home about; honestly it was the same quality as one of the salad bags you pick up in the grocery store.  The lettuce had a little bit of a earthy taste, almost like they didn't wash it before they served it.  This location does not serve wine or beer, which was a shame because I really would have loved a glass of red wine.  Lastly, we ended up with the cannoli for desert and I was not impressed at all; one bite was enough.  

I was really taken back with the amazing pizza, but the establishment was not my taste.  From now on I'll be taking Spinato's to go.The bad: its a cavern with suspect patrons and greasy food.
The good: its a cavern with suspect patrons and greasy food.  :-)

Seriously, its a bar and great for a few drinks (don't worry about getting prettied up...just go in your workout or work clothes or pajamas and you'll fit right in).  I wouldn't drive across town for this place but if you're close by and want to relax with a beer and friends, this place works just fine.The atmosphere is nice.  I think both the food and drinks are a little overpriced for what it is but I know the rent down on Mill is marginally insane.  I've never had a wait here and the food comes out fairly quickly.  Occasionally I've had a server disappear for a while but that's the exception, not the rule.

My favorite things on the menu are the Crispy Crab Wontons which are served with a strawberry sauce instead of the more traditional sweet and sour, and the Drunken Monkey Flambe - which is somewhere between Bananas Foster and Cheesecake on fire.  They have a wide selection of specialty drinks but none of them really catch my imagination.

The food itself is ok, sort of like PF Changs upped their prices but didn't up the quality or presentation of their food.  This is a place I go because I'm meeting people who want to meet there, not necessarily a place I would ever choose.  The sad thing is that it's not because it's godawful.  It's really not bad.  But between the pretentious decor and the mediocre food I always end up feeling slightly let down by the restaurant experience.  It's like dating that person who you can find no real flaws with but somehow you still lack chemistry.

Sorry Bamboo Club. It's not you, it's me.Dave's has pretty okay hot dogs, but their prices are astronomical for what  you get. Some reviews mention its pricey thats an understatement be prepared to mortgage your house or sell a kidney for these dogs. M vote not worth it.You can ask to try samples! Watch out for the nuclear cherries, they're soaked in everclear!The place is so organized for being a pretty large thrift store.  Props.When checking in I was greeted by the General Manager. It was nice talking to you Michael; I hope to see you at the Westin La Paloma. The Sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport. I stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 3:30am (Complimentary). Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME!  I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa.
My little sister and Mom enjoyed the pool as well. Nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too. If I ever have to fly out of Phoenix or into Phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the Sheraton Phoenix Airport.I am currently waiting on a Cobb salad to go.  It's been about 25 minutes #liveyelping #yelpondemand. I will edit this as needed if this Cobb salad for some reason provides a mind explosion experience in which I will completely understand the 30 minute prep time.

Alright it was pretty good.Jury still out....  I ate there once and it was not so good but I still have high hopes!Always remember. You get what you paid for. Don't expect high quality Japanese food.  I decided to give 3 stars because food is about average. I ordered lunch combo D and spicy tuna roll.  It comes with Chicken, vegetables, edamame, potstickers and a drink. 

Chicken was  dry, it was expected.  I think many people have commented same about chicken being little dry.  It is cooked on charbroiler. So expect the little dryness.  

Spicy tuna roll was fresh and enjoyable. I think they just made it when i ordered it. So make sure to ask when it was made before ordering.  Because it is already made and stored inside the container.

Service was good. Owner was friendly and attentive. 

For the money. This place is a great for quick lunch. I would revisit again if I am in the area.  However, I wouldn't make an effort to drive the distance just to eat.we have been here many times.

i love love love the roman bread

celebrated my bfs moms bday.

they loved theri steak. however the server laura sucked big time. couldnt even refill two waters. slow with the bread. tip wasnt so good.

tried the wings, they were too hot for mild. tweaks in menu. befor ei had the spaghetti, its too watery and tastes like ketchup.

the steak is ok..i had the ceasar salad normal. veggies are always soggy.

my bf likes the fact that they have kiltlifter beer.Based on this prior visit, we went back to Monti's for lunch. This time the food seemed to take forever. I tried the Salmon Salad and scarfed down a ton of chips due to starvation. I really wish this building had better lighting as the maps/photos and documents of historical significance would mean more in a well-lit room. 

I ventured about as many of the rooms were closed at lunch and realized this pace is huge!

Food 3 star
Service 3 star
Ambiance 3 star-maybe, 4 or 5 with proper lighting!I have mixed feelings about Monti's. The service was very good, and the building was cool (although rather maze-like, it's easy to get lost). The food itself was, IMO, fine but nothing special. The salad could have been fresher, the fries could have been more cripsy, etc. The prime rib my dad had was excellent, but my filet was very overcooked (grey! and I had asked for medium rare!) but they took it right back and quickly brought me a nicely-cooked cut. Dessert was also good, but again nothing special. Overall not a bad place but I don't feel the need to return.While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan.I was really excited to come here since I have heard such great things. I will admit my expectations were pretty high. I started out with the beet salad. It was okay. Nothing special to talk about here. Then I had some fish, which I can't find on the menu presently. It may have been halibut, but it definitely was delicious. The dessert was also just blah. The portions were small, but since I had all three courses I was full. Would I go back? Nah. Our waiter was also pretty out of it.I went here in early December and I was REALLLLY looking forward to it. 
I'm new to America so dining in new places is always fun, especially when someone recommends this place 10 times over. 

It was so dark I couldn't see my menu. I didn't mind though, the waiter was funny with it, held a couple of candles by the menu till I picked what I wanted. 

But what I ordered, when it eventually arrived was really cold. I was soooo hungry after a fairly long wait for just entrées that I couldn't wait another 45mins. What I had was delicious! But just cold after a long wait. We were both hungry after our entrées as well....

I would really love to go back and may be this time round the food would be hot!

It did leave a dent in the wallet though....So may be not for awhile....6/1/11

I finally made it to HoT for happy hour!  Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.

Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!

The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).  Will try to return for lunch!I really wanted to give this place five stars due to the great patio seating and the amazing rack of lamb. However, the service was unimpressive and that is really what we took away from this place. As mentioned earlier, the lamb was very good and their sole vegetarian dish of portobello tempura was good.  The desserts were hit and miss.  The PB lava cake was good but the bread pudding tasted like pancakes.  I won't bother with dessert next time.  

The quality of their entrees and the atmosphere out on the patio make it a recommended place to go. I just wish the service was on par with their food and atmosphere.Saw the Cubs play the Rangers here on March 20, 2012.  This is clearly one of the older spring training parks in the Phoenix area.  The park is rather small, and it is kind of difficult to find a restroom.  However, the field itself is beautiful, and the park is a very intimate place to see a game.  We sat six rows up on the first base side and had a great view of the entire field.

I have to hand it to Cubs fans.  They were out in force for game day and having a great time.  Everyone had that mid-west friendliness.  As people drank more beer, the crowd just became more happy and friendly.

I only gave three stars because there are some issues with the age of the stadium and the location is not great (park in the marked lot next to the stadium and not in one of the impromptu "lots" set up in someone's front yard.  Also, the beer vendors come around a bit too frequently and kind of disrupt game watching.

About the seventh inning, we moved to the outfield.  If you want to save some bucks, this is a great outfield to sit in to watch the game.  There is lots of space and it is like a day at the beach with everyone playing and having a good time.

All in all, a good day, but Hohokam is just a notch below the newer spring training venues.I just moved here from Chicago where there's a huge Japanese community, so I was fairly surprised at the collection of goods sold here since there doesn't seem to be quite as large a group of Japanese people in Tempe.  The store is pretty spacious, and they sell the basic foods one would miss if from Japan like curry, udon, ramen, ochazuke, etc  They also sell some housewares and rent out a small collection of videos that have current Japanese tv shows recorded on them.  The prices are basically the same as where I'm from (which is slightly more than I'd like to pay), but that can be expected seeing as most things are probably shipped from Japan.   Still, the people are nice, the goods are plentiful, and the prices are sort of right, so I'll be back.No need to make the trip over but they have good lunch boxes (bento). The sauce was a bit sweet.  The prices are reasonable and the chef cares about his food.  Now on Saturdays they only serve about 30 ramens only at 11:30am.  He peeps them one at a time.  So it's not quick service.  The chef will prepare only one kind that day.  They set up tables so you can eat there.  If you're in the area stop by but if not no need to make a trek over.After reading all the glowing reviews about their ramen, we had to check it out. We arrived on time and were #11&12. They only had 30 bowls that day. It's not your regular restaurant atmosphere, it's more of small grocery store with a side kitchen. 
We had the soy based ramen and while the noodles were delicious, the soup( which I think is one of the most important part of ramen ) was too salty. There was only 1 slice of pork and not enough toppings for my liking. Not bad for $6 but I expected more.So, I went to Phoenix this weekend and obviously bookmarked this Buffalo Exchange first. As what I would like to think, I am a bad-a Buffalo extraordinaire. Here are my thoughts:
1. Parking was great. Being so near to ASU I was weary of a possible parallel park in my rental car, but my nerves were calmed when I saw the lot with plenty of spaces.
2. This is a larger Buffalo. The racks are spread out and there is plenty of space for more than one person to be sifting through a rack.  
3. What was most frustrating to me was the lack of unique styles on the racks. Usually a Buffalo in a college town means great finds.
4. Prices. Above average.
5. I'll try the other location next time I'm in town.The buns were bought from a place like costco. The fixin bar was limited. The tomato was cold and therefore had no flavor. The meat tasted good.Great location.  Decent burgers and ok wings.Like having a backyard-grilled burger. It's good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.I've heard A LOT about the Chuck Box over the years, so I finally decided it was time I gave it a go.

Atmosphere-wise, nothing to write home about. It has a similar vibe to the Original Hamburger Works, with a wagon full of condiments and a similar order, watch them grill your burger, pay setup. The place looks old, which I guess is part of it's appeal. They only accept cash for payment, which is kind of lame in this day and age.

The burger itself was good. Good like a home-cooked burger on the grill would be. For $8 and some change, I'm not in a rush to hurry back here, but I won't say that I'll never return. Overall, I just didn't feel it lived up to the hype.If you like your food fried, then this is the place.  I never venture inside anymore because I'm afraid of slipping on the accumulated decades of lard and vegetable oil.  If they find a detergent powerful enough to clean it up, I will know that the end is nigh.

Everything at this place is deep fried, even the cheeseburgers.  It is all delicious, except strangely for the fries, which are below average.  

If you would have asked me to rate Pete's 15 years ago, they would have received an extra star, but with the state my arteries are in today, I just can't pull the four star trigger.HAPPY HOUR REVIEW!!

I went with Camille H and Elaine B for our last Tuesday Happy Hour of the year at Caffe Boa.

The bar area is pretty dinky, and the student/20-somethings were kind of snooty about giving up backpack covered seats for our butts, but we managed to find some seats. This restaurant is very pretty - beautiful lights and high ceilings - my kind of spot, except for the pretentious peeps. 

Being a HUGE fan of the Chef Payton when he was at Digestif, I was so excited to try this place! As Camille mentioned, the mussels were so so yummy - I would come back again just to eat that dish. But the pulled mozzerella was a huge disappointment. I really hope the "old school" is up to par next time.

YOU MUST TRY THE RED DELICIOUS COCKTAIL! It was so so so so good! This cocktail includes vodka, apple juice and apple foam with an apple slice for garnish. The foam tastes like caramel apples and the apple cocktail is like drinking freshly juiced apples - I've never had anything like this before!

I really wanted to give this place a higher "happy hour" rating, but I cannot. The drinks were delish, but pretty expensive ($10 each). The pretentious peeps kind of ruined the mood for me (people who think they are out of this world make you wish they were!), and the pulled mozzarella did not live up to my expectations.

About KIDS: This is NOT somewhere I would ever bring my five year old. The food and drinks came out too slow - it would be a torture for a kid.3 stars by the skin of their teeth.  Was there last Friday night and things were hopping...with the customers, that is, but service was painfully slow, both at the bar where we had drinks and appetizers and for dinner.  When we eventually did get our entrees the people at the table next to us  leaned over and said "i'll give you $30 for that - we've been waiting an hour!"   We had too, so we understood their desperation.  It was a wait to order, a wait for our food, a wait for the check, a wait for the receipt...ugh.  Now keep in mind that I love leisurely dining and hate being rushed.  So if service, especially at dinner, is slow by my definition, it is truly glacially paced.

So on to the food.  The bruschetta - simple and wonderful due to the fresh and flavorful small tomatoes.  The bread and dip trio (hummus, oil, pesto) is also pleasing.  I ordered the fish of the day, an atlantic sole in buerre blanc.  The fish was fantastic  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and with a perfect texture.  The buerre blanc was a useless bland sauce that did nothing but detract from the fish.  The salad greens in aioli dressing were a miss.  The weirdly bitter aioli drenched the greens, making them a soggy mass.  The table consensus was "interesting.  Not good"

My husband's fried chicken was oddly and unpleasingly  bland, and tasted devoid of seasoning or salt.  I only ate the coating because I am allergic to chicken, but isn't that supposed to be the best part?  The husband confirmed the meat was similarly bland.  My sister in law loved her annolotti.  We would have liked to try dessert but we'd been there so long by the time we were afraid we'd become permanently attached to the chair and decided to escape while possible.I have eaten lunch at this locale twice. The decor is modern and comfy ,had the muffelata sandwich which was tasty  and the second time  i had the flat bread w/camilized onions, prochutto,and had them add some lightly dressed arugula on top. nice wine list good serviceCeasar salad was great, but adding chicken cost $6. Very pricy.After contemplating several restaurants to dine in before heading to Gammage the other night, I finally settled on trying out Caffe Boa. I've been intrigued ever since the Easter incident, and I've seen Chef P on tv a few times and his food always looks great. So I thought what the hey, let's give it a whirl.

We're seated right away as I made a reservation, expecting it to be very busy with shows going on at Gammage. We place our drink orders right away. However, it took almost 30 minutes for our drinks to come out and I was told it was due to a heavy load of drinks ordered. I didn't think it was that busy to pour two glasses of wine. It also seemed that our waitress was very distracted and inattentive at first. This is my only complaint of the evening. 

We received our food very quickly after it was ordered and our waitress was more attentive after the wine debacle. And luckily we were out the door  in time to make the our show.

Our group decided to order three appetizers and two entrees to split so we could try a few things. We ordered the French fries with aioli dipping sauce. The fries were pretty good and the sauce was delicious. We also ordered the warm pulled mozzarella, which was superb. But I love anything with fresh mozzarella. And the third appetizer was the Shrimp Adriatico which was also very good. The sauce that it came with was so good that we asked for extra flat bread to sop it up with!

For entrees we ordered the Lobster ravioli, which I thought had a great flavor and I really loved the large chunks of lobster inside the ravioli. I think the portion was a little small, so if you order it, you will definitely want an appetizer as well. And then we also tried the fried chicken. The chicken was very moist and perfectly cook inside, but I would have liked it a little crispier on the outside. But overall, I thought it was very good.

So despite the slow start, I think we had a pretty good experience at Caffe Boa.I'm sad that the kitchen has poor quality control.  Dinner on Saturday was dead.  A bunch of chicks getting drinks mostly.  The wine menu is extensive.  Service was awesome.  This poor college girl listened  to me complain for 5 minutes.  This is the first ever Italian restaurant that I've been to that didn't even offer bread.  We ordered the antipasto.  It was great!  Different... Loved the idea of fritatta being added to the platter.  My entree was basically a pesto veggie pasta.  I was told it was a lighter dish.  Each bite I took I had to wipe the oil off of my chin.  WTF?  After four bites I had to give it up.  I was grossed out by the puddle of oil on the bottom of my plate.  From what we gathered from the server...  It sounds like the restaurant lacks quality control.  Beautiful ambiance.  It's upscale Italian with a modern-southwestern twist.  I will go back for a glass of wine and appetizers on the patio...oh..  and I will be sure to ask for bread.  Us guineas love some bread!The original location. 

I've heard great things about this place and was excited to walk in for happy hour. Unfortunately, from my first step inside I was quite disappointed. Partly because I imagined the inside of the restaurant to resemble their outside patio seating and partly because the bar was full with limited seating in general.

People keep raving about their sangrias so friend and I ordered a glass of white sangria each. It had a surprise kick of cinnamon which was unexpected but nice. I would rate the drink itself a 4 star. Then to start off our "dinner" we ordered their shrimp, mussels, and two different bruschetta. 

Reactions to -

shrimp: both of us were quite disappointed in the shrimp. Their sauce was good but there were about 5 pieces of shrimp in the dish and they didn't look appetizing at all because they were so small. Waste of $6

Mussels: this was pretty good. the mussels were definitely better tasting than the shrimp and came in bigger proportion. The only flaw was that there were about 4 empty shells in the bowl adding to our disappointment.

Bruschetta: both of them came on toasted bread that didn't taste as good as we had hoped. Friend kept comparing them to the ones at La Bocca and rated La Bocca much higher. 

This night ended up with us hurrying to pay our bill and running to La Bocca during the last 10 minutes we had to make it to their happy hour.Thai Basil is alright, not great but alright. I ordered the Pad-see-ew and the weirdest thing is that the noodles were tasty and delicious but all the veggies and chicken were pretty well tasteless. Plus, my medium to hot dish was much more mild to no spice. 

However, my iced Thai coffee was delicious and the service was very friendly, they even went to find me when I stepped out to Tops while waiting. Also, the the prices are very reasonable, my whole meal was less than 10 bucks.

So, ok for now, I'll try some more dishes and hopefully be more excited.I don't really have much to say about this place.  There's nothing wrong with it, but their dishes don't "pop" for me.  They are not very flavorful (crazy for a thai place, right?) and I often find myself adding Fish Sauce and Chili just to get it to be good.  Lunch prices are fair, food seems fresh and service is great.  My coworkers LOVE this place and I enjoy their company, so I tag along.

Best part is they have soy milk for their Thai Tea.  For me, it's the best part of the meal.Food was mediocre. Service was mediocre. Nothing special about this place but they still got 4 stars? In California, when a restaurant got 3 stars and a half, it had to be really good. I'd give 3 stars for everything though.C Moore's is a nice place.  The only "neighborhood" bar I know of in Tempe.  Good beer selection and some decent eats.  I'd visit it again.I hate to say it since this is known as a popular local spot, but I guess the idea of hipsters, punks, and scruffy dudes is cool for you then it's cool 4 U.  It's just not my cup of tea.  I can dig the outside X-mas lights and misters firing away cooling the patrons while downing a glass of beer.  Regardless, I think that's the best part of CM's -- the crowd and it's energy!  However, I sat inside away from the crowd to enjoy my meal.  To proclaim the Fish & Chips "best in town", you best be right and knocking my taste buds out.  (Then who can complain -- it' fish and chips -- it is what it is....)  It was okay at best and I was hungry!  Service was okay, but it didn't start out that way.  Couldn't find the hostess, either that or she was having drinks with the crowd haha! (place was packed!) - Enjoy!I like Casey Moore's, it's a cool place, and a good option for lunch and late night. 

For lunch, the service typically takes forever. I've had 1.5-2 hour lunches because it's painfully slow. The food is pretty good and the drinks are strong.The best part of Casey Moore's is the vibe and the atmosphere. It's very laid back and a nice place to hang out.

I don't think it's the cleanest of places...One night I saw a cockroach in the tiled area between the bathrooms, which was nasty. There's definitely a dingy element to it, which isn't really my thing but maybe enhances the vibe.

It's worth checking out if you're in Tempe and tired of Mill.Once I walked in, i was greeted and had the option to seat myself wherever I pleased. I had trouble deciding so the waitress recommend the crab cakes and the spinach cheese baked oysters. I washed it down with age pear cider. Oh was it delish! The crab cakes came shortly and it was paired with an aioli tasting sauce. It was really a good combination and I would highly recommend it. It's the best crab cakes I've tried even compared to steelhead diner in Seattle. The oysters came in after 20 minutes after the warning did mention on the menu to allow for up to 35 minutes. It was delicious, but very rich to the taste. It had cheese and spinach and with a spritz of lemon it was just right! 

I came during happy hour and they knocked two dollars off my crab cakes or any appetizer and it all totaled up to 23 bucks including tax. It's fairly cheap. 

I would come here again! I am a big fan of fresh raw oysters so that would probably be my next purchase.6 days and counting.

I called CMOH to inquiry about having a dinner/event there. The woman who answered the phone (rough offshore oil man voice) attempted to answer my questions but wasn't the event coordinator. She took down my information and said she would place it in the box of the event coordinator. Still waiting for a call back...its been 6 days.

The three star review is for at least someone answered the phone when I called.

Great atmosphere and food. I've been here many times with friends but disappointed with this experience.Stopped in for dinner tonight after reading mostly positive reviews. My quick take? not bad but not great either. Service was pretty prompt, food didn't take long, so those things were nice. I had the wings and a shrimp & avocado salad and wasn't blown away really by either, at least they had a decent beer selection though.Compared to the Crab Shack on Southern and McClintock, this is the far superior location.  The food, service, and cleanliness of this place is better, despite them being both part of the same seafood restaurant chain.  The seafood itself varies, as the queen crab was pretty tasty and sweet, but the lobster in my Arctic Bay steamer was pretty bland.  The shrimp that came with it were good since they were the ones that soaked up a lot of the Old Bay seasoning.  I also tried some of the crawfish platter, which was a delicious mix of crawfish etouffee and fried crawfish on top of white rice.I met up with a friend here for a quick dinner after work and I took it for what it was worth. We grabbed a beer and some half price appetizers from their 4-7 happy hour menu. We were the only table in the place at 7PM, however there were others at the bar. 

The food was average. They had really good ranch dressing and a salad that used actual green lettuce (romaine) which I was impressed with, considering. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my friend had the Chicken Parm, we split them. It's super affordable for a sit down dinner and feels good to support local businesses as much as possible.

I would go back if it was convenient - but I wouldn't bring out of town visitors.Went here about two weeks ago on a spur of the moment. 

Presentation (4 stars) - 

Cute little place, very family owned kinda vibe, very welcoming and homey.

Service (3 stars) - 

Service was average. We went on a Friday night and they were pretty full. There was 3 servers trying to handle about 5 tables each, bad business practice. 

Food (3 stars) -

This is the interesting one. We ordered the bread with marinara as an appetizer and a pizza. The bread was pretty good, essentially just garlic bread with pepper and some marinara sauce. The pizza is pretty good artisan style pizza, but small portion for two. We were still hungry after an appetizer and pizza, good lunch portions.

Price (1 star) - 

Alright this is where it really gets me. The food here was incredibly expensive, the toppings were anywhere from $2 to $7 dollars. We had pepperoni and sausage, and the pizza was about $19 for a 12 inch pizza. PRICEY! Our bill came out to over $25 with an appetizer and pizza, this didn't include tip and we didn't get any drinks.

Overall, the price is what we keep me away from here. I would just as easily go to Grimaldi's or even NYPD for similar quality food for half the price. They overprice EVERYTHING.After living in the neighborhood for almost 10 years and seeing this place daily on my way to work I just never felt compelled to stop in. In the past I had received mixed reviews from friends and checking out the menu there just wasn't an overt draw for me. 

Then the Groupon showed up... OK that and I do love to support a local mom and pop place... My nephew and I dined there this evening. Our meal included: 
A raspberry Italian soda for him, water for me. For an appetizer we shared the Mediterranean Mix (Olives and Feta) with fresh baked bread (Yummy!) I am convinced that there must be some type of additive that makes this bread addictive! The Olives and Feta were good... but just that olives and feta.. I guess I expected more of a tapenade... this was more of a split plate of olives with pits on one side and feta on the other. I also ordered the dinner salad... it was OK but not worth the $7.75 and the house dressing was no bueno! Oily mess! Stuck with the balsamic vinegar that was already on the table. 
We shared a pizza. Figured we would keep it simple. Ordered the Margarita with 1/2 Italian Sausage. Margarita for me, sausage for him. The waitress (Tomi) asked if we would like fresh basil on it... ABSOLUTELY! Apparently our order was a source of confusion since when the pizza came out it had onion, peppers, mushrooms and sausage on it... My nephew is not a fan! We explained this to our waitress that we did not believe that this was our pizza and she seemed extremely put out... I explained again that we wanted 1/2 cheese and 1/2 Italian sausage. She took it back to the pizza cook who quite loudly told the waitress that it was not the order that she wrote down. She did come back and explained that apparently there is a pizza on there menu that is specifically called the Italian sausage that comes with all the other stuff and apologized for the mix up. Oh well, no worries... So the second pizza came and this time was closer but still not quite right... No fresh basil... Now that I think about it neither one had the fresh basil on it. Why offer it if you are not going to write it down??? Pizza was mediocre... Definitely had better. 
My nephew said that the Italian sausage (apparently made in house) was really good and he seemed to enjoy it. Margarita pizza is just a plain cheese pizza... nothing special, nothing fancy. The crust was good though. 
We ended the dinner with a shared slice of the tiramisu. It was good... definitely could tell that it was made in house. My nephew really enjoyed it and stated that it was the best he has had so far. 
Total bill... Just under $43.00. 
I would go back but not sure that I would recommend it or would rush back.It's Food City...not AJ's, Whole Foods, etc... 
Don't expect this store to be something life changing. 

They have great prices on all Mexican food ingredients and some really good weekly specials. The produce is always fresh. 
When the hatch chilies are in season they roast them fresh in front of the store. 
Some items like cheese and processed foods are a bit more expensive. 
The check out staff is friendly and it never seems really busy, so check out is fast.Smaller, local Hispanic flair. If you want off brands or small brands they got them, nothing special, good bakery. Clean friendly service.Hoping this place lasts. Great location, an oasis in the desert. 
Service still needs some help. There seems to be plenty of servers but they are not very attentive and a bit slow. 
We had the ribs and the sliders. The ribs were a bit too spicy for my taste and the sliders were okay. Good selection of beer and promising menu. 
Beautiful patio and ample seating inside even on a Friday night. 
However be warned the band this night is awful!  Cheesy 70s & 80s music and not in the fun way but in the bad /sad way. 
Will try again for sure.I stopped in here yesterday for a quick bite to eat.  I was surprised at how many people were here on a Thursday morning!  Quite a line.

I got a bagel with cream cheese, and it was yummy.  I had a very positive experience here considering it was Einsteins!Ordered beef brisket dinner with red beans and rice and macaroni salad.  First thing I noticed when I walked in was little smoke was in the restaurant, not sure if that's a good thing.  Ordering was quick and took my dinner back to the hotel.  Opened it up noticed how much sauce was on the brisket,  taste was okay.  I think they use oak for the smoke,  I could be wrong.  The brisket had very little smoke,  no smoke ring that I could see.  Overall, just okay BBQ.  I did like the hot BBQ sauce..Positive: a much younger crowd than the 24 closest to my home. Better people watching. 

Negative: crowdedNow let me just start by saying I freaking LOVE Target. Okay, so anyway. I can't believe I'm the first person to review this location, it's an ancient store compared to the new ones. Don't tlet that fool you though, it is remodeled. The store remodel is a good and a bad thing however. I just moved to this area recently so I'm not sure in what shape this store was before the facelift, but I'm sure it needed it. Very nice and refreshed inside, clean, your typical Target red EVERYWHERE. It's already a kinda weird layout to begin with seeing as this location is set up as a square rather than a normal, longer rectangle most Target stores are layed out as, but in the remodel they added a grocery section with fresh food and more pantry options. I'd add a star for that and the added convienence the extra grocery brings now that it is a p-fresh location like all other Target's have become, but in order to add that larger grocery area they've had to significantly shrink other departments in the store to compensate, so minus extra star we just added. 

Moral of the story here is this Target is great if you just need to run in for a few basics, but if you have detailed shopping or you're looking for something specific it's probably a better idea to drive either way on McClintock to the Tempe Marketplace Target or Chandler Santan Target. 

This location is still nice to get you by though. They have a food court with Pizza Hut Express, Pharmacy tucked way back in the corner, and a nice Photo Lab up by the front door, which is my favorite thing here. They took photo out of most Target Stores so it's nice this has one being closest to my house to just ride up quickly and print out a few pics! Overall just a very standard, plain Target Store. Nothing too special here. Just enought to get you through the week.Best neighborhood bar in Tempe. Food is awesome wings are a must try, burgers a so juicy and the fries are awesome!!! Pretty good selection of beer-could be better- but overall love this hang out.

I am re-visiting this review because the place has changed some. The bar is not as clean as it used to be and the wings lately have been small and scary (black bones). The beer on tap is not as cold as it used to be...Not sure if this is actually related to the Woodshed II, it is the same kind of place though. Major group of regulars, some kind of cool. They pretty much own the place though. 

The bartenders and waits are pretty good. Especially in keeping the regulars from bugging the visitors too bad. Neighborhood bar, great to visit. Especially if you live in the neighborhood.my husband and I ate here a few weeks back and found it to be ok. The service was very awkard and absent minded, but friendly. My husband and I ordered identical breakfast sandwiches and a butterscotch crossiant to share. The lady taking the order must have been overwhelmed because she kept asking us what we wanted on our sandwich and when our order was ready, the sandwiches were slightly wrong. 

We first had to ask for our butterscotch crossiant as they forgot to give it to us, then both of our breakfast sandwiches were half right. We ordered our sandwiches with veggies and we didn't get veggies. I didn't really mind, but  my husband politely asked if his could be re-made. They were very gracious about re-making the sandwich and gave him a new one right away. 

The butterscotch crossiant was good, but sort of disappointing. I would have liked more butterscotch. 

All in all this place wasn't bad. I would go back. I do think their prices are a little high for what you get.Spent time visiting an artist friends studio in Tempe on Saturday. We decided to get a bite to eat and drove to Wong's Place.  I've been here 6 or 7 times in the last 2 years and have always had a good meal.  I had the kung pao chicken lunch special for $5.95, which included a decent hot and sour soup, fried rice, crab puffs and hot green tea.  The service was attentive and I never went without an ice cold glass of water.  The chicken was spiced well and was tasty, not too spice, just right for me.It's cold & flu season... if you're feeling bad, I urge you to go to Wong's and order the House Noodle Soup!  It works every time!!  A couple spoonfuls of the chili paste and you're feeling better - I guarantee it!  Their potstickers are also some of the best I've ever had.  The service is fast and friendly.  My only complaint is that sometimes the place can be a bit... seedy looking.  It doesn't help having a dive bar next door.  The inside looks the same as it did when I first ventured in there in the early (mid?) 90s.  NOTHING has changed... probably the same silverware and cups.  It's just messy looking.

We've tried some other entrees and have been very impressed with the quality and authenticity.  I think it's nice that they  have "American Chinese" and "Chinese Chinese" menus.i've been going here for several years now, and i as long as i see dr. finch, i'm pretty happy. he's done one surgery on dozer (a minor laser procedure to remove a growth from her eyelid but did require anesthesia) and was very reassuring, informational and has a good dogside manner. just found out he'll probably be doing another surgery on her (much more major acl repair) and i'm totally comfortable having him do it.

i only update and drop a couple stars bc 1. i was prob a little too gracious on my first review (i was a new yelper with out a system yet) and 2. other friends talk about how much they LOVE their vets, but i don't have that kind of passion for this place. i keep trying to shop around, but put it off until all of the sudden, dozer needs help NOW, so i want to go somewhere she's got some history on their files.Food was good. Service and hospitality was also good. Price of bottled beer was a little high. I did not expect to pay $25 (including $2 tip) for two combination plates and two Modelo beers. The funniest thing about this place was that they serve the food on glass plates but give you plastic ware to eat it with. I will go back for more but will probably stick to soda or water.Their claim to fame seems to be the pollo fundido.  To that I say, I've had better.  While inexpensive, the fundido was a little salty and could have used more flavor, but all and all, not a waste of time. :). Salsa and chips are free for eat ins, and the salsa is yummy.  As for the best pollo fundido, I recommend Julio G's in Scottsdale and PV.If you're here, you already know the deal. Salsa bar FTW! It spoils me, as I can no longer visit any other Filiberto's location in good conscience. Must try after the pub closes.The drive thru is more cordial than the counter service.
Okay, this probably isn't true all if the time but it applies to tonight.
The food is inexpensive, portions large, taste generally good too.  
I like the green chili burrito.  It's filled with shredded pork in a green chili sauce and it's got some spice but I still require hot sauce.
Salsa bar has good variety and there's a place where you can serve yourself chips.
Crazy hours -they're open 24/7.  Perfect for the bar crowd.Better than a dive Mexican joint and less than an abuellos or Macayos. If you want quick & inexpensive come here. Salsa bar is what brings be backReally good. But sorry, definitely not Pei Wei. Can taste the deep friedness. Greasy. Less chicken than bread. No fresh veggies. Cheaper tho.Well,...I used to like this place much better before it became golf land. I REALLY don't understand the new look of the place. I didn't used to particularly like coming here because of it's massive size and ability to make a 5 minutes trip turn into a 30 minutes trip, however the new design has added to my restrain to visiting.

This is still a great place to get good deals on some electronics. You just have to deal with the crowds, the line, and the golf theme.To be fair, I only get pizza from here because it is ordered weekly by the financial office at my school where I present lectures for work study. I have tried the pepperoni, sausage, and cheese. I like that the personalized pizzas have a good crust, remain hot and cheesy with their delivery package, and the crispiness of the pepperoni. The personalized boxes and parmesan/hot pepper packets are a nice touch. They also always come with coupons on the box.  Nothing special, but it will be a long time before I say no to free pizza!Not the best car wash on Bell road that's for sure. Two times I have brought my car for a wash and the keys were left in my vehicle. This scares me as auto theft is huge in Arizona. Customer service is so-so. I usually bring my vehicle early morning before 9. If you want to get the early bird discount be sure to pay before 9am as I learned from experience. Brought my car in at 7am walked across the street to work, picked it up at lunchtime and paid to find out I can't get my early bird discount because the hand written receipts are not time stamped.Got the half lb. ranch burger. It was good. Don't. See what the big hype is overI was impressed with the service and the family owned feel of the place. The pizza. Not so much. I agree with other reviewers that it is far too saucy. And not in a good way! And that the sauce is indeed too salty. We only ordered one pie and it was really, extremely filling. The boy and I only had a slice each and split another. 

I will most definitely be back to try some other things on the menu though. I am sure that there will be something I like.Food is Great! But I was not impressed with the Customer Service not so friendly..Used to get delivery from here years ago, but apparently they are now under new ownership and no longer deliver..my other half NEVER wants Chinese so when he agreed I had to take the time to go and pick it up..might not have the chance for Chinese for another 6 months. 

When walking in the interior had changed a bit, new tables, chairs and flooring. Noticed right away it was clean. a polite lady took my order and while I waited a man shelling pea pods made small talk. 

The food only took about 5 minutes and I was on my way. The other half ordered the Mongolian Beef dinner combo (combo comes with chow mein, fried rice, egg roll and a fried won ton.) Ordered sweet & sour chicken for the child and I ordered the Garlic Chicken.

The other halfs beef was wonderful, spicy but not too much, with a decent ratio of meat & green onion, the chow mein on all orders had large pieces of chicken..the egg roll was more like a small spring roll with translucent wrapper, still very tasty.

The low point of the meal was the Garlic Chicken, not enough spice and was more like a bland brown sauce without the garlic kick, not at all like the sauce I am used too.

Overall for $22.00 the meal was worth it and the next time the husband gets a hankering for take out it is going to be 1st on my list.I was here last year around November or so and the food was pretty good.  We decided to come here for a change from Great Wall.  So 18 of us (that is only some of our family) went there tonight.  The "adult" table ordered and our "kid" table order for ourselves.  Here is the low down:

1.  Chicken cream corn soup - Ok, a little bland
2.  Fried tofu - This dish was AWESOME and the sauce was excellent
3.  Pot stickers - They were store bought and they fried them, not pan fried
4.  Yan Chow Fried Rice - It was pretty good, the kids loved it
5.  Chicken Chow Mein - It dish looked d'lich but the taste was missing
6.  Walnut Shrimp - It tasted funny not sure if it was the shrimp or sauce
7.  Peking Pork Chops - This dish was great and the sauce was tasty
8.  Beef Stew with Noodle - More fat than beef and noodles were ok
9.  Pepper Beef Ribs - The flavor was ok, but some of the beef was a little more rare than we like

All in all, it was ok.This is the only eating establishment within walking distance of my shop.  This is probably the first time I have been in there in maybe a dozen years.  It hasn't changed much.  The first owners tried opening Saturdays and a group of us would gather almost every week for breakfast, then it got hot in the summer and they closed Saturdays until fall and then opened Saturdays again and just about the time they built back a regular Saturday crowd it was summer again, they closed and we moved to Cocos (now bulldozed at Maryvale and Indian School.).  They are on the fourth or fifth owners now and I have had a few lunches picked up for me over the years.  Ironically two of the guys I used to go to breakfast with were there eating lunch with their parents today.

When I first moved here in 93 an Italian pizza/pasta place had recently gone out of business at this location and the suite was vacant until the Corporate Cafe opened, IIRC, the fall of 94.

The menu is sort of eclectic with some American standards, a few Middle Eastern and a few Mexican.  Each owner seems to have added a few things to the menu and it is now about twice as many items as were on the original menu.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch and everything on the menu is available any time.  The food is ok but not great.  It is priced right for what it is.  This time I had a mushroom swiss burger ($5.75) that came with my choice of salad, fries, cole slaw, soup or potato salad and an iced tea ($1.75).  I got the salad and it is iceburg lettuce with a couple small pieces of tomato and cucumber.  The hamburger came dry with a packet of mayo and ketchup on the table.  The lettuce, tomato, sliced onions and pickles are on the side. For my taste the meat was too well done but still a bit juicy, I get the impression that is the way it would come even if I had specified something else.

The main customers are people who work in the area and quite often sales people take local clients there.  It's an industrial type place that fits pretty well in this older industrial area.  It is clean and the colors are pleasant.  Like this whole area of town it isn't as busy as it was a few years ago.It is a very clean bowling alley. The equipment needs to be updated and the software for the game needs to be updated.  The pins kept getting stuck and had to reset every time.  The employees were nice and friendly.Every meal comes with a kiss, we were informed shortly after sitting down. I was going to ask if we had to cook our own food or how that whole thing worked out, but didn't.

KTC was a solid 3 stars for our breakfast this morning. I ordered the Canjun Bene; Paul, the Belgian waffle; and Jason, the biscuits and gravy. Three orders of mini muffins arrived shortly thereafter, with real butter and apple butter that was at the table. As others have stated, the muffins were great. Our meals arrived in a timely manner and we all dug in. Paul polished off his waffle promptly while Jason and I slowly enjoyed our meals. I honestly have to say I wish I didn't eat so many muffins because I wasn't able to finish my eggs, which were wonderful. The creole seasoning added to the Hollandaise sauce added a terrific flavor and just a little heat.

The decor made me feel like I was back home in Northwest Ohio. That doesn't add the the appeal for me, but some enjoy those things.

While service during our meal was attentive (I drink a lot of water during a meal and their glasses were pretty small, but I was refilled several times). However, after our plates were cleared, we sat around for almost ten minutes before we could flag down our server for the bill. Which was when we also received our kisses. Hershey's Kisses. Cute, but I rarely eat candy. Still, cute.Good breakfast spot with friendly service.  Definitely has a diner vibe.The seats are a decent size, It's hard to argue with free parking, and they built a mall around it, but it's such an awful location.  If they were to locate the hockey arena in Downtown Phoenix, south Scottsdale, or the north part of Tempe it would be in the exact center of the valley, instead it's all the way to one side.  If I lived in Gilbert of Chandler I'd never drive that far to go to a game.  I've heard rumors that it was supposed to be where SkySong is, which would have been amazing.  Instead it's halfway to California.  If it was perfectly located I'd give it 5 stars, if it had a decent location I'd give it 4.  Instead it gets 3, based entirely on being located so far away from civilization.This has to be a new one. 
Looks very nice and clean. 
People where helpful and nice. 
Has to be The best one I have ever been to.A star for good, a star for fast, a star for cheap. It's hard to find all 3.I never find the things I need here!  And I am still pissed at not getting my $150 rebate (from 5 years ago).  Bought a wash/dryer and they ran a promo for getting a rebate, they LOST my original store receipt when I initially submitted it.  Then they will NOT accept a copy of the receipt, WTF!  I only come here when I absolute need to.Much better service than the Sonics I'm accustomed to (Vegas mostly), the food, not so much. Of course I can't complain, coming from So Cal, where there's one Sonic (in Anaheim) to serve a 100 mile radius, it's kind of a destination there. Here I'm spoiled. LOLNot bad food, absolutely superb patio but very, very spendy.  Expect to pay $100 for 2 people.  Service was a bit slow for a Sunday night.  I would go again.  I loved the burger, but the filet and the short ribs were very bland and unremarkable.Just a cute place with pretty good food! I loved sitting outside and watchng the great cars and bikes in Cave Creek. Harolds is a greasy spoon kind of a place, but that's part of the fun of it!Went here last Friday night with some friends for a drink and to listen to some music. I had heard this place was mostly for the country lovers but when I went they had a fun rock band that did cover songs. Lots of people dancing the night away until about 1pm (it's a slightly older crowd; 40's-50's from what I could see). Had a good time and drink prices were fair. Didn't try the food; maybe next time.I had the shrimp tacos and they were pretty good.    My friend ordered a Purple Haze brew infused with raspberries and it was amazing!  I enjoyed a fresh iced tea and the amazing scenery off the patio.  You can't beat the location and desert landscape.  However, I thought the service kind of blew-- it was slow but felt rushed when she stopped at our table.  Maybe they had too many tables per server.  Prices were pretty high but we both did like our selections.   I'm not a beef eater, so maybe if I was ordering their specialties, I would  have hit a winner.  It's a checkerboard table kind of place with a touristy vibe and price tag.Cave Creek has its share of cowboy/steak/country-music/rib/fried-chicken touristy type places.  This is no exception.  It is the best of the lot though, and not a bad choice if you're in the area.  The beer garden has live music many nights and can be a chill hangout.  You'll be amongst cowboys (the real deal), wealthy folk from the area, and an eclectic mix of other bar friends.  Inside you'll find families and tourists for the most part.  Don't come here expecting exceptional food -- it just ain't gonna happen.  Ribs and chicken are staples and hard to go wrong with.  Just be careful of that chili beer... Heather L. says it best - "it tastes like someone took a bottle of corona and filled it with table pepper".Food was good. Clam chowder was too runny and lacked clams. Service was friendly but slow after the initial order. Perhaps I'll sit inside next time.

I'll be back, but not before I try a few other places in the area..This is a classic greasy spoon dinner. If you like huge portions of standard breakfast fare (omelets, pancakes, waffles), this will hit the spot.  Our big complaint was the coffee. Very very weak. They said that they just got a new supplier for coffee and blamed the watery brew on this.  They were nice enough to take our coffee (which we didn't drink) off the bill.Went to Cave Creek and decided to try The Horny Toad!  Was fun looking at the gift shop and the restaurant was tasty.  Enjoyed chatting with other customers that were in the outdoor section, We all seemed to enjoy the place! Service was excellent ! Seems to me the prices were high for what they were! Overall I did enjoy it and had to buy the HORNY TOAD TEE SHIRTS.When I first moved to the Phoenix area I drove past this place a number of times thinking, "tourist trap where people from the Midwest pretend they're cowboys".  I suppose that's partially true - hint to the guy from Chicago, black shoes, black over the calf socks, tan shorts, cowboy hat and creamy white legs isn't a good look on you or anyone else. I don't care how horny the toad is.

The first time I came here I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was OK but it wasn't great. It was a bit overcooked making it dry and the BBQ sauce tasted store bought. For my most recent visit I went for the BBQ chicken. Ah yes! this is the meal to order.  It was very good. Tasty, moist, good flavor.  Nice job!

The service is odd.  It was busy and the wait staff were running around like crazy people. A positive is we were spared the "hi, my name is Suzy and I'll be your server" bit.  What you get instead is - "OK, whatcha havin?" I'm OK with that in a place like this.

Not the best restaurant in the area, but a nice stop for a good meal and you've got to love the name (they sell tshirts).He was very helpful with a dental issue a few years ago, and for that I am grateful, but since then, things have changed. As a self-described "dental nerd" he used to love answering dental questions. When I went back this last time, we were talking about Cerecs and zirconium crowns and I had some questions. Surprisingly, he got put out and said, "I don't have time to take you to dental school." lol Wow. That surprised me. 

The other issue is that if you ever have any conflicts with service or health issues or mistakes you feel you need addressed, you can forget it. He and his staff will circle the wagons around the practice at the expense of the patient. They are more afraid of being sued than they are concerned with your well-being, but I guess that's common these days. Perhaps his malpractice insurance went up again? Possibly. Too bad, in any case. I think if not for one particularly negative incident, he'd still be my dentist. 

I wish Dr. Lamborn and his staff the best in the future.This Frys usually has a great selection of fresh organic fruits and vegetables. A lot better than other grocery stores in the area. If I can't make it down to Phoenix for my fresh fruits and veggies I always stop here.Stop by the Hideaway today and had a good time. Plenty of bikes, food and live music. It's worth the afternoon to spend some time there.Not bad! was very slow for a Saturday but the food came quick and prices were competetive with everyone else.tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or it's out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means "Hi, can I take your order" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :)

Since moving to the west valley from southern CA we've been itchin' to find a replacement for Alberto's or Taco San Pedro. Humberto's reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired.

With that said here's info on what we had:
If you're from So Cal and have had Northgate's shrimp ceviche Humberto's comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good.
Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job
Nachos - good

If you've been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humberto's should do.Drive by this place everyday on my way to work, figured I would try it out. Big language barrier, Asked If I could have an egg and chili verde burrito. He kept on telling me it's a machaca burrito. After about 5 mins of trying to understand each other, and I was begining to run late for work. I drove off with my machaca burrito. It was good, not bad at all. But not what I was looking for.Rio Mirage in El Mirage has gotten kind of blah. The food used to be spicer, more flavorful, just had some pop to it. The service has been meh as well the last few visits. This most recent visit, he never came to check on us nor did we get a single refill. I hope that they will take this to heart as a long time El Mirage resident who has been a regular customer that they should NOT tone down the flavor of the food to satisfy the old-sters who only come for a few months out of the year. If you are wondering why your place isn't as packed when those folks go home--now you know why!Cute "space" themed place in a near-empty city that exists because of the highway intersection here.  There's a lot of cute space painting all over the walls.  Service was friendly and overall good.  Food, however, was no different than any mediocre diner, and they were charging big city prices.Unless you are heading east or west between San Diego and Phoenix on U.S. Interstate 8, Gila Bend is out of the way. Still, my children and I took a day trip to Gila Bend to eat at the Space Age Restaurant.

There are three or four things to see in Gila Bend; the sign as you enter town with the population posting which includes "1,700 friendly people and 5 Old Crabs," some frighteningly bad "dinosaurs," a jet parked at the airport and the Space Age Lounge and hotel.

From the moment you walk in, you will be delighted by the amount of copyright violations contained within. Gene Rodenberry will be in Gila Bend soon as he is spinning so fast in his grave, he is drilling towards Gila Bend at twenty miles per day (yes, I know he was cremated...get a life, nerd!).

It's a fun stop and supposedly the hotel is clean and comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised by the food at the restaurant. Obviously it pays to order the daily special. Mine was a burrito with red sauce and it was delicious! I forgot what the kids ordered but it disappeared, which is the best compliment one can give the food. 

Service was...efficient and friendly, but I couldn't help the feeling that they somehow looked down on me for...being human. If I were an alien, where better to hide than a "space hotel!?" We humans are not bright...but very delicious!

Stop, eat and get back on the highway before dark so you can live long and prosper..and not be turned into the "daily special."I had a fine experience here, but I did only stop for a bite ... and had pie.

The wait staff was very nice.  I thought it was an interesting place.  Too bad the original Satellites were gone.  It getting dark so I couldn't go look at the replicas by the pool.  The story behind the restaurant was interesting.  It's been rebuilt a few times, and it used to have real Satellites there, but now just has a kitchy fake space ship on top.The biggest reason to stop here are the pleasant proprietors.  They were kind and generous.  I found the food unremarkable but I probably asked for the wrong dish.

After i ordered the 3 tables around me all asked for some quacamole dish and sounded very disappointed when told they were out.

Other than a pleasant stop there is little to recommend Sofia's.The only reason why I give them three stars is because my first experience was wonderful staff was very helpful and even let us finish our game even though our two hours were up.

Our second trip HOWEVER was disappointing the assistant manager was very rude. I asked if we could split the bill and she rolled her eyes at me and sighed and stated no she couldn't do it. The First time we were here we did this and the staff had no issue and were very friendly.
This was just normal staff but the fact that the manager treated me this way was very disappointing.

Also we wanted to sign up for bowling all summer because there is a sign up that says you can inside and she rudely told us we had to go home and go online.I checked out Enochs on Friday and I had a good time.  The band was playing decent music, not my taste, but I got into it, and the people were cool.  Many different types of people, so it kept things interesting.  My only problem was that it was impossible to order a drink.  No one ever came to our table and when I went to the bar, it was nearly impossible to get the bartenders attention. But overall, I had a good time, and in the end that is all that really matters.We were looking for a fishing lake and campground near Pheonix, Az, and this place seemed like the only thing we could find online. The pictures and google map showed a decent sight, nice water and campgrounds... however... it did seem odd that there were almost no other reservations I saw, so took a site near the bathroom where there would be some light. 

We reserved site #176, at Desert Tortoise Campground... it was nice, BUT nothing like the pictures online... there was NO water (the check in host mentioned that water is below 40%). The bathroom was pretty good tho: clean  bathrooms and hot showers (probably because there are no other campers in sight!!) We set up our tent, and drove to the water a bit, and thats where all the people stay, at the shorelines. We tried to fish for an hour, but there was no bite at all, then left the park for an event in Pheonix, and returned late at night... OMG, talk about "spook factor!!" it was like a ghost town, there wasnt anybody in sight... creepy!! So we didnt get any sleep that night, it was just to creepy... we ended up packing at about 4:00 am and left.

Aside from the "creepy" feeling of not having people around, its actually a very nice campground. Hot showers were a plus!!Rude staff. 
Fast service. 
Taco Bell is very greasy and just thrown together. For 2 menu items I did receive 23 (yes I counted them) packets of mild sauce. So I would say generous describes them as well. 
KFC has great food and well, you can't really mess that up can you.I come year once a year when I visit my Aunt.  Food isn't amazing, but they have low prices (even lower if you get there before 6pm).  Live music on Monday nights, and it's always fun to watch the Sun City locals dancing!Something non chain on the land of the walking dead. Average. Blue hairs like the one price for everything deal, requires less thinking on their part. Instead of a coat check room they have a walker check. Live music on some nightsI use to stop in here once in awhile back in '05/'06 when I had caseload with some homes out in the NW Valley, at which point I would have rated it a 4 or 5 star.  Now that I have been relocated to our new Peoria office, I decided to swing by for lunch and give it a try again. Unfortunately, after my revisit I would now only rank it a 3 star, as my food tasted pretty much like any other decent Chinese restaurant.  I do admit I may be partially to blame, as for some reason I chose to order one of the most Americanized dish in Chinese/American cuisine, Lemon Chicken.  The chicken is done in the nugget style, not the whole breast sliced style like I generally prefer Lemon Chicken.  Although it was nugget style, the pieces were not grease and the quality of the chicken was good.  However, the sauce was pretty bland with very little citrus flavor. I did get the lunch combo. The fried rice, soup, eggroll and wonton were all decent with no heavy grease taste.  Portions were a little smaller than most Chinese places in the valley, but it was a good lunch for $5.25. I will probably revisit soon and give another dish a try.

The service was great, they had my food out quickly and I was finished with lunch in about 40 minutes.  Lunch combos are $5.25-$6.25 and most diner entrees are $7-$10.  For Vegetarian/Vegan they have a few choices of the typical vegetable dishes found at most Chinese restaurants for about $7, but at lunch you'll have to ask for the dinner menu to order them.  Also, they are promoting their food as no MSG and low sodium, which with the smaller portion sizes probably makes this restaurant a slightly healthier choice for Chinese food.  If you are looking for a quick Chinese sit down or to go lunch at a good price in the NW valley, Golden Star is a good place to stop in.Its awesome to finally find a 24 hr Mexican food joint! It did take a long time to get my food but it was well worth the wait.This location does not serve lettuce or tomato.  So when I asked for a monsterburger deluxe w/ cheese.  The guy taking my order was like...uhh what's deluxe?  So I told him that at the Indian School location, they have the deluxe option with lettuce and tomato.  He then told me that they do not serve tomato or lettuce.  

Get on the lettuce tomato bandwagon Tolleson Pete's!!  

This location is crazy busy on Saturdays nights (probably on Fridays too, but I went with my mom on a Saturday night).  Highly suggest not parking on the west side of the building and the line of cars in the drive-thru can stretch all the way to the street...and you may have to wait for a few minutes to back out of your parking spot.  Best place is to park on the south side of the building.What's with the occasional poor reviews?  I just don't get it! Doesn't everybody already know that they serve previously frozen battered fish and shrimps? I don't go there expecting hand breaded fresh seafood but I do expect it to be freshly prepared which they never disappoint! Granted not much shrimp or fish under the breading but hey, what do you expect for the reasonable prices. When I do go there the food is always hot...right out of the fryer, the sauce is ok for most folks but I take a bottle of Tabasco with me and additional salt is needed on the fries. The servers are not overly nice or friendly but I am not there for that....just eating and getting satisfied is my goal. The dining area has properly adjusted misters and overhead fans on the large clean covered patio during the summer and heating in the winter. My overall description of Pete's is unpretentious x 10! So....just eat and enjoy yall! :-) 
BTW wish they would serve oysters again damit! - 1 starThere is nothing great or nothing bad about this place.  So, I have to say that I am very  disappointed  that it wasn't spectacular!  I was really hoping that I would finally find a Chinese restaurant not too far from home that I would fall in love with.  I ordered the Mongolian beef combination plate.  It comes with rice, egg roll, soup and sweet and sour pork.  The beef was fine.  The rice was a little on the dry side.  The portions were fine, you won't leave hungry.  My dish cost about $8.  The service was good.
I really hope I find a Chinese restaurant that I love soon on the west side.I stayed here the night before my wedding with my bridesmaids. There were 5 of us total, and we shared one room. The room was a nice size, two queen beds, two desks, a mini table, and a reclining chair. We arrived late Friday night and had issues checking in. We made our reservations online, and they claimed we did not. Keep your confirmation number if you reserve online - it will come in handy. Also, you have to park down this hill in their lot, and I'm not sure if it's because it was late and they didn't have a golf-cart service going (we saw several parked in the lot), but you have to walk up this ridiculously steep slope with all of your luggage to get to the lobby. 

We swam a little Friday night, and the pool was less than thrilling. It was just your average pool with about a thousand chairs strewn about its deck. There's one small jaccuzzi. The hotel itself is ok, not the nicest. The hallways can be compared to your average Best Western. We didn't dine at any of the restaurants, but we did grab some quick morning snacks at their cafe in the lobby. Nothing special here - a few pieces of fresh fruit, bottled water and odwallas, some yoplait yogurt, and a few uber-processed muffins. Completely overpriced, as well. 

Not sure if our stay was just too short or what, but for the price of this place I'd rather shell out a little more and stay down the street at The Boulders.As far as resorts in Arizona go I can say I've been to better. Carefree Resort was okay but it had a few major drawbacks.

I stayed on a mini staycation with my boyfriend and his Mom for a Mother's Day getaway. Separate rooms, of course. :) We arrived on Saturday eager to escae the heat and relax by the pool. The pool area is very nice except for one thing - THERE IS NO SHADE! When it's over 100 degrees the last thing I want to do is fry sitting by the pool. Yes, the pool itself is refreshing but not everyone wants to bake in the sun after their swim. They literally have one umbrella that's not attached to a table - and only two of those. Seriously Carefree Resort, invest in some umbrellas. And maybe a few more towels, those seemed to be in high demand as well.

The room was clean enough but outdated and rough around the edges. The door was banged up and really needed some paint, the light in the bathroom had a hole in the shade, the lights by the bed were rickety and the bed was lumpy. I woke up with a backache. The shower was awful. The shower runs really hot and the showerhead sprayed water in every direction except onto my head.

The one good part was the restaurant. We were originally told that the brunch was booked but when we showed up Sunday morning they found us a table and the food was really good.

Overall I would go back to the restaurant but I would not stay there again unless they fixed the place up a bit.I'm surprised more people haven't written a review for this place.  I have been eating here since I was about 11, but hadn't been here in years.  The restaurant itself is very small, but there are a lot of seats outside.  My husband had the Mountaineer that included biscuits, gravy, eggs, country fries, and a cinnamon bun.  The cinnamon bun was delicious, and hot.  There was so much frosting on top, it made my teeth hurt.  The country fries were hot, fresh and crispy.  As for the biscuits and gravy...TO.DIE.FOR.  The gravy is the best tasting gravy I have ever had.  I had a cheese and ham omelette, but wasn't impressed.  The meal was hot, but the eggs weren't fluffy and they didn't put enough cheese in the omelette.  I would eat here again, but would get the Mountaineer or just Cinnamon Bun the next time around.  The service was good, quick and friendly.Not much for Thanksgiving stuff. Lots of Christmas stuff coming in pretty busy very helpfulpretty busy I pop in now and then just see what that's a really helpful to help you whatever you need so you can take stuff out of the box for you help packing the car looks great service thanks a lot guys.They can make an old fashioned.  This can be hard to come by. 
The bar was filled to the brim when we went in, We opted for the patio and sat a few minutes, wondering 'do they come to us, do we go to them?'  We go to them. 
It was a Saturday, around 4:00, and they were setting up for a band, if we hadn't been on the way to a wedding we may have stuck around.
Overall, not bad at all, It didn't knock my socks off, but not bad.Issues were resolved after filing formal complaints with the BBB and ROC.Ah, a slice of Americana dining. Sometimes we all have a hankering for some grease-soaked fires ( or onion rings, as the case may be ) and want to slosh it down with some frothy root beer. 

I had one of those moments this weekend while crossing back into Vegas from Arizona. And, lo, and behold, there, looming on the edge of town, A & freakin' W! We were jonesing for the tangy taste of an A & W float since we first passed it going OUT of town. Now was our chance to relive the childhood memories of hopping into the Vista Cruiser Station Wagon and heading out for some grease and sugary drinks. 

The person who designed the parking lot should be flogged. If they are still alive. It looks like a model T chugging along at 20 mph would navigate the maze well, but not so for any modern conveyance. 

The cute and homely front counter gal was all bubbles and smiles. Hell, ALL the employees were downright cheerful. But I was feeling vertigo as the ordering counter was at a bizarre angle to the seating, so I ordered my Float ( of course ) and an order of fries and rings and staggered out into the dining area. 

Seating was a definite problem. Actually the lack of seating more the problem. The place was chock full of families with their kids in various levels of sports uniform disarray. It almost looked like a munchkin football convention. 

This wasn't bad. What was bad was the table of people who could have been transported back to 1977 and would have been sporting sideburns, Village people porno mustaches, feathered hair, Angel Flights, and have come in from their black and gold Trans Ams. Transport them to now: wearing Juicy Couture purses, stone washed jeans, Ed Hardy shirts, and House of Pain Fighting Irish gear with the brim sideways. You get the picture. More than once, I wanted to lean over and ask, "hey, what are you in for?". They were loud, obnoxious, and they fit in perfectly with the artery-hardening fast food. 

And what was really crazy was the single restroom that caused a major backup at the rear of the establishment. It was utter chaos there. And wouldn't you know it, that was exactly the only area to grab a table. And it was also right next to the po boy trailer park crowd. 

No freaking wonder the drive-thru was so damned busy. Take a clue, drive-thru. only. 

I'll do this again in five years after my memories has dimmed somewhat. Colorful, boisterous, quaint, but not quiet. If only the A & W root beer wasn't so danged good.Small market that doesn't have that many options.  It's, however, more convenient to get a few things from there because of distance.  They have the basic essentials you might need for cooking such as spices, oils, and of course, Kimchee.  To make some standard Korean meals, you can get your ingredients here though to make more complex ones, it's best to go somewhere else.This is a small and intimate casino at Lake Las Vegas.  It seemed virtually deserted every time I visited.  If your looking for a nice clean environment where you don't have to deal with crowds this might be the spot for you.  Most people will probably enjoy the faster paced gaming experiences available around the strip.I need an air filter for my car, and after looking and looking, I couldn't find a single one that would fit into my 2012.

When asking an employee, he told me that they are "special" order because it is a newer car. The employee was kind, but it is frustrating that inventory isn't really up to date with new cars....shouldn't they at least in the back if not on the shelves...?A bit seedy but the drinks are cheap and I won $40.00 bucks!!Stayed here for my cousins wedding since it was 5 mins away from the chruch.  Overall the casion is huge, the overall place doesnt smell of smoke too much which is nice.  The staff is nice and answered every question I had.  I personally didnt have too much luck with the slots, however my family did pretty good espeically with the video poker.  One thing I really liked about this hotel was the food selection, they had soo much plus they had a movie theater inside which was pretty cool as well.  The one thing that really turned me off is when I was in my hotel room I saw a bug, and it wasnt just a spider it was huge, although I was super scared I think I killed it.  Throughout the night I couldnt sleep that well cause I kept thinking about the bug.  Anywho overall stay was good besides the bug problem I would say if you want a cheap hotel, away from the busy strip I would stay here! Oh another plus they have $1 margertias everday!!!spotted them next to my auto parts store and I was famished. Ordered a meatball sub togo and it was great. homemade meatballs, nice marinara, plenty of cheese and nice crispy italian roll. put me in a good mood and made installing my alternator  much easier.I fluctuated between 3 stars and 4 stars because I think they're a 3.5 if you take into account 3 means "A-OK" and 4 means "Yay! I'm a fan!"

So consider me a 3.5 which would be, "The food was good with a lot of potential to be great and I really WANT to be a fan."

The review stats are interesting & always help put a perspective on things. For instance on Johnny Mac's, 2/3rds of the reviews are 4-5 star. 1/3 of all reviews are 3 stars and under. So that basically means 1/3 of all reviewers were not happy with their experience in some way, but the majority were. Also of the total amount of their reviews, 1/3 are by Henderson locals. The graphed trend for 2011 is going down. Of the 5 reviews for 2011 thus far, 50% are 3 stars or less & complain about service. Not sure why this trend is happening there. So enough about number crunching their stats, how about the nitty gritty of my own review?

So how did I arrive at a 3.5? Details below.
---------------------------------------

Our table ordered a Jalapeno Cheeseburger w/fries for $8.95 and the 2  slices of pepperoni(or cheese) with a soda for $5.99. 

The main points are this:

1) The food runs from good to outstanding depending on what you order. 
2) The service is spotty

What this means is you'll have to know what to order in order to have a fantastic meal, and you'll have to forgive the spotty service. Think of it as offering BAR service, NOT restaurant service. Just flag down a server whenever you need something, because are always busy. Do not expect automatic drink refills, asking if you need anything, if you want dessert  or to have your plate removed after you are done. If you get it, great! If not, remember 30 percent of all their reviews talk about the food and/or spotty service. So just don't be surprised when it happens to you. There is a good chance it will. Just learn what to order and lower your dine-in service standards.

The spotty service does irritate me but depending on mood I'll still eat here. How I adjust for it, is in the tip. I tipped 15% this last time but wanted to tip 10% because my server literally did the bare minimum. I didn't but should have. I just always feel weird tipping only 10% but if it happens again I will. 

We entered and stood for a few minutes because the servers were busy. We offered to seat ourselves at a high table instead of standing around. No big deal, it's a casual place. After about 5 minutes we got our menus and gave drink orders. Our order took 15 minutes. 

The burger patty(med well), cheese sauce, bread and fries were A+. The jalepeno slices on the bottom made the bun fall apart when I held it because the juice soaked the bun and made it taste overly vinegary. So I ate the burger with a fork and knife open faced style and disgarded the bottom bun. If you order this ask for jalapenos on the side.

The fries are aweeeesome. There were none left when I was done. Lots of crispies. Yum yum give me some.

I don't have an opinion on the pizza because it wasn't mine, but they loved it and ate it all. Just FYI, when you order the 2 slice deal, the pizzas are baked whole and sliced then stored in a 3 tiered rotating, heated, glass display. They are not cooked to order.

Total came to $16.15 with tax...but with tip was almost $20. Ouch. Right now with the lack of service I don't think paying full price here is worth it. There are lots of other places I can go for 1 burger & 2 slices of pizza for 20 bucks and get a better experience.

HOWEVER, on a half off pizza night or coming with a coupon would be worth it because for a discount I am willing to overlook the lack of service. 

When we got the bill, that is the only time our server, Jemma/Gemma, came back to our table after delivering the food.

If you're here to watch sports for lunch you're out of luck. They have all of the TVs on but volume on zero with NO SUBTITLES. Music plays in the background (80s-90s laidback mix). 

There is a full bar.  

==============================

If I could figure out, what they are known for, I can see this review becoming 4 stars. They really are good for basic bar food.  

Tips:
-Order the fries over the onion rings.
-order the regular burger over angus (I've had both and angus is too mild. it's juicy but the beef taste is stronger on the reg. burgers.
-order wings but if you don't want dry wings, perhaps order extra sauce. A lot of the reviews say the mild is tasteless. Perhaps order medium. People also seem to really like the hot. Expect less sauce than you would get at other places but the wings are meaty. You can also order these "double baked" which means they bake them in the pizza oven after deep frying. I assume this sets the sauce better? I have no idea.
-Order the pizza, and also try the thin crust. (i'm a fan of thin crust and will try this next time)
-Remember that wed night is half off pizza nightWe hit up this place after getting some Frost Bites(Nothing wrong with dessert before dinner, right?)
 
It doesn't look like anything from the outside, but when you enter, this place is JUMPIN!
at least it was when we visited. Hostesses kindly greet you at the door, and by the looks of it, there seemed to be at least 80% (maybe 90) of Hendersonian regulars that hardly ever venture out of Hendertucky if they don't have to.

Family owned and operated, they are out of Buffalo, NY....Birthplace of the Buffalo Wings and have been a Henderson institution for over 20+ years. The plethora of menu items here are unbelieveable, but we came for two of their specialities-Pizza and Wings.

The Pizza was good, but a bit greasy, and the wings....they were just okay, I guess my expectations were higher after hearing that they were from Buffalo. Oh well...The Watermelon BBQ sauce was tasty and the service was great, so maybe we'll give Johnny Mac's another try....maybe...ALOHA!!!The Cinedome opened back in 1993, and being just down the street from my house, it is one of the theaters I have been to the most. They have done a few renovations over the years, but unfortunately, the place is starting to show its age.

As the name implies, the Cinedome has 12 theater rooms inside. Sadly, they are a bit small and cramped compared to other, newer establishments, namely the many Regal theaters that have opened up across down. Of the 12 theaters, only 2 of them (the 2 "dome" ones) are of a decent, large size. 

A major flaw of this theater's outdated-ness is that they don't have a lot of the luxuries of newer theaters, namely 3D and IMAX showings of films. 

Like most movie theaters, this one has a snack bar. The selection of food items here is actually very good, though it too can't complete with the onslaught of items Regal has to offer. One thing I will say in their defense, though - The Cinedome has the best nacho cheese of any theater in town. Also like most theaters, the snacks are severely overpriced, and there are "no outside food and drink" signs now posted outside the building. 

An arcade is also part of the Cinedome, however the last time I was in there half the games were out of order. Very few of the games in there are what you would call "new", anyhow, and there aren't too many real classics either. It's a hit and miss arcade, though I'm grateful the theater has one at all. 

Regal opened a theater in the Fiesta Henderson in 2007 which blows this place out of the water. Everything this place doesn't have, they do - bigger theaters with better picture quality, a full-blown snack bar that offers a little bit of everything, a full-sized arcade right outside the theater, the list goes on.

Despite the Cinedome's many flaws and being outdated, I won't deny that it is convenient - considering it is right down the road from my house and you don't have to walk through a casino/parking garage/etc. to get in. The Regal inside the Fiesta is a far superior theater, but if you just want to go watch a movie and aren't far away, you can get in and out here pretty conveniently. 

Final verdict? If you're in the area, you may as well go here if you don't want to go the extra mile or so to the Fiesta, or walk through their garage or casino. The Cinedome gets a firm recommendation, but Regal still blows them out of the water.There is nothing especially wrong with Cinedome 12.  They have 12 screens and, like newer theaters, digital projectors.  The sound is clear.  They have a snack bar that is conveniently close to each of the 12 theaters.  They keep it rather clean.  The seats recline in every other row which is nice given that it is the old gentle slope seating as opposed to the new fangled stadium style seating.  And the price is a fair $6.75 per person.  That all being said, I was simultaneously shocked, amused and disappointed last night after seeing the late night showing of Jurassic Park in 2D.  Yes, I said 2D.  My dad and I paid $6.75 each to see a 20 year old movie without the new 3D touch.  Get over it.  We get dizzy watching 3D shows.  Anyhow, the last showing of the evening was at 10 PM.  After the previews and the 2 hour film were over, my dad and I left the theatre walked through the empty lobby and out to the absolutely pitch black parking lot with zero lighting.  We were in disbeliefe.  The fact that they would turn off the lights before the customers have even left the building was astonishing.  It was a little creepy walking out there.  My dad had to use his clicker to flash the lights so we could simply find the car.  We started laughing at that point just happy to have not been locked in the building.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much though.  It was basically a private screening with just my dad and I in the theater.  Still, it felt like we were forgotten about and that to me is poor customer service.Over priced service and bad at time estamentsWhen we go out to Henderson, which is about 3 - 6 times a year, we usually make sure we stop at the Joker's for a spell.  They definitely have the BEST MARGARITAS.  I also love that they have a little snack bar by the bar that serves shrimp cocktails and pretzels.   By the way, the shrimp cocktail w/sauce is fantastic.  
We used to eat here all the time but they were going through some transition and it's just wasn't as good.  Now they are on the ball.
The jokers features a lot of penny games for the cheapskates and the ladies come around with the drinks........which is always tops in my book.  
There is a live band on the weekends that is usually pretty good.  This is a fun place to relax, eat and gamble.   No frills.I give them a solid 3 star review.

All in all it was pretty decent and economical chinese delivery for the entire family. Everyone I had contact with was friendly. This meal fed us all for supper and we all have leftover for lunch the next day for $45. I've had better chinese food, but this is the best (thus far) of what I have at hand within MY local delivery area....

....and that was the whole point. I didn't want to cook, I didn't want to drive anywhere, and I wanted chinese food. Score!

So of of the 6 locations this got the middle of the road average at 2.5 stars. I ordered not knowing this so I'll share my experience of how it was from start to finish.

They actually have a much higher rating on Urbanspoon(US) of 81% which has 4 reviews, 3 of them were recent from 2011. I found them on google maps looking for "chinese". I was able to see the menu clearly and decided to give them a try.

For a total of $40.55 I got:
1 large order of orange chicken($7.45)
1 large order of beef pepper steak($7.95)
1 large order of chicken egg foo young($6.95)
1 wor wonton soup($5.95)
1 small order of veggie egg rolls($1.75)
1 chicken fried rice($4.95)
1 order cream cheese wontons (free with order, but would have cost $3.95)

The woman on the phone had a strong accent but I managed to get my order through. I asked if there were any deals and because my order was above a certain amount she threw in a free order of cream cheese wontons, which my son will love. She was very friendly.

I was quoted at 1 hr on the delivery. It arrived right on time. There was nothing missing from the order and it arrived hot without anything leaking.

I paid $45 total, including the tip to the driver.

Large chicken entrees run around $7.45, Sm $4.75
Large Beef entrees run around $7.95, Sm $4.95
Large Seafood varies from $8.45-$10.25, Sm $5.25 
Egg Foo Young from $5.95-$7.95, Sm $3.95-$4.25

They also do Lo Mein, Chow Mein, Curry, Teriyaki, Pad Thai, Chow Fun(noodles), Hong Kong style pan fried crispy noodles, rice noodles, and 6 vegetarian entrees.

======================================

First, the bad:

I found the war wonton soup to be very bland. I added a lot of soy sauce because it tasted like watery broth. I would not buy the soup again. On a good note, it tasted better with the soy sauce. There were also chunks of bbq pork and whole shrimp. Lots of goodies in their soup.

I didn't think the cream cheese wontons to be worth the money if I had paid for it...but since it was free, they were OK. I will ask for more egg rolls instead next time.

I don't usually eat egg foo young so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but this was a little too plain for my tastes. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just there and we ate it.

========================================

Now the good stuff:

The rest of the orders we got satisfied our craving for a chinese dinner. We sampled from everything family style. Lots left over for everyone else as they got home from work and lots left over for us for lunch the next day.

The orange chicken tasted just like what one would expect from orange chicken. Lots of sauce. It was crunchy and saucy in each bite. It soaked up enough sauce as to be flavourful yet had some texture. Son ate it up. I ate it up. I think panda express has better orange chicken but panda doesn't deliver does it. Nope!

I liked the Beef pepper steak. Could have been more beef than pepper but I have to tell you the beef was a good texture and taste. The sauce was great on the rice. It's ironic that it costs more than the orange chicken because you really get a LOT more chicken from that...than beef from this dish.

The chicken fried rice went quickly. Just good basic fried rice.

We also got a container of plain steamed rice for each large entree I'd ordered. I'll probably make my own fried rice another night with it because we have so much rice leftover. So...neat because we eventually get another meal out of this in a round about way.

========================================

I will continue ordering from them, but I'll change up my order next time until I hit a short list of "go-to" entrees. The first on that list is the orange chicken.I love the Charleston location.  I am not as impressed with this location.  While it is close to my house, thus available for breakfast on the weekends, I have say that the quality of food is not quite there, nor is the level of service.  Maybe I will give them a try again in the future, but there are so many places to get breakfast, they need to step up their game.its good not  very clean but its good fast foodAs far as hospitals go, who really likes them. My mom came into the ER here and was seen immediately. The staff was really friendly and kept us informed of what was going on. Yes, the wait for a room was long, but I think that's pretty much the standard in ER's. 
The rooms themselves aren't fantastic, but this isn't a Ritz Carlton. All of the nurses and staff here were really friendly and did a great job in taking care of my mom. It's an older hospital that needs some renovations, but overall it was a decent experience. Having worked in hospitals as an EMT, I know when hospitals are really crappy, and this one is a decent hospital. I know this place has crappy reviews, but everyone's experience and situation will be different. I'm happy to say that our experience was a good one.Let me start off by saying the food is okay for the price. I was a little disappointed because my order wasn't right. The shrimp was overcooked, hard and rubbery. One of my egg foo young patties had a rotten taste to it, but the other three patty's were okay...go figure...
I expressed my concerns and was given another fresh order the next day. So I will give them another chance. Staff is friendly and place is clean.I like their lunch menu. The portions are a tiny bit small but still fills you up. I'm a of the pick 2 lunch deal. And it's awesome they let us choose 2 entrees. Usually get the penne pasta and chicken wrap. Price is right and food is good. Definitely a worthwhile lunch spot. Only negative is its always busy during lunch ao food and bill will take a while tO get to you. Don't think I've ever made it back in under an hour and it's a block away.If you have time to kill, you can gamble. Unlike most airports, you would get bored.A small-ish airport for a growing city. They'll probably need a new one built on the other end of town just to keep up with the ever-increasing flow of people. And..you'd think with Vegas' reputation they'd have at least a flashier one. Maybe the new one on the other side of the city should have giant roulette wheel-shaped terminals flanked by 200 foot stripper poles.An airport with slot machines in Vegas, go figure.  My trip was painless through here but there were a lot of people trying to get their luggage despite that we arrived in the middle of the night.  But over all... no problems to report.This airport was soooo strict.  Their check point moved really slow and many people were being searched including my gf (her fault for bringing an oversized lotion in her carry on).  We saw phone chargers for the first time too.  For $3 you can super charge your cell phone for 30 mins....

The best thing about this airport was the slots......For the first time during our entire trip.....we came out winners....we hit the progressive 5 mins before boarding....a big $12 dollars whoot whoot.  Overall, we put in $5 and came out with $30.  They should make all the slots winners at the airport so people wont be sooo gloomy leaving las vegas....I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the huge airport, the decor is nice and overall a very pleasant experience.

If I could change one thing is the SHUTTLES.  First you catch a monorail to baggage then another shuttle  the rental cars. SUCKS in this hot weather!Twice now I have had transfers here and have not had any problems in the airport.  My only complaint is that everything is overpriced.  With slot machines around every corner and every gambler throwing their money away on them - Does this airport really need to rob people even more?Although it is a bit more crowded than other airports I've been to, it was a pleasant experience.

The Good:
- Free Wifi
- Quick and Friendly Security / TSA Agents

The Bad:
- A bit crowded
- Some signs should be more clear about where things are (ticketing/check ins)I have mixed feelings about McCarran Intl - in some ways it is really good and in others it seems so small time for an airport that sees millions of tourists per year.

When you fly in there you are pumped about being there and the ding ding of the slot machines gets you excited.  Until  you get to baggage claim and it takes a year and a half to get your bag.  OR maybe that's just when you fly American or another super popular airline since it didn't take that long this time when I flew Frontier.  Getting a cab is fairly easy but you have to queue up and if it is busy you will wait a while.

Check in at the gates has always been easy for me.  Once you get your boarding pass you walk to the tram to take you to the gate.  Why do you have to take a tram there?  It is separate from the main building?  Why are there so many restaurants and shops located before you go through security?  I want to sit and drink at these places but I also want to be close to my gate.  

Once you get to your gate they do have a selection of restaurants but I don't get why none of them really have waitresses.  Counter service only.  However, I'm not going to complain about Wolfgang Puck's express restaurant (Terminal D) - that chicken aioli sandwich was the bomb.  I thought it was funny how every drink has a size choice - I wanted chardonnay.  In the 6oz or 9oz?  (Clearly the only choice was 9oz in my mind...)  Beer in 16oz, 24oz, or 32oz.  Ah Vegas, it is always about the cash!! Upsell!  Upgrade!

The free WiFi was nice for surfing the net on my iPhone.  The option to play slot machines is also nice if you are bored and haven't lost all your money already.  People watching here is stellar too - and you can make up stories about them in your head.  Or you can eavesdrop on people talking about all the crazy stuff that went on while in Vegas.

In the end it doesn't matter if you love it or hate it....you'll still come here because you want to go to Vegas.Not sure if other airports let you park your car on the side of the airport and watch planes but this one does.  There is a section where you can just park and watch the planes land and take off - just like in the good ol' days.  Kids and grown ups come and watch and ohh and awee while the planes and jets land and take off.First time flying into Vegas... it was a bit of a shock to see slot machines in the airport... but it's Vegas.  The airport seemed fairly modern and well kept.  Some of the gate numbers did not quite flow since there were some pockets and branches, but once you found a map everything made sense.

I guess some sections of the airport are old - so I may have been in the newer portion of the airport.  Leave a lot of time in your schedule for your flight back if flying back from the weekend.  There seemed to be a mad rush to the airport to catch flights back to reality.  I made it to my gate right when boarding started so it worked out for me, but I can see where flights can easily be missed if you get stuck waiting for a taxi or waiting to be dropped off at a good point by a taxi.Great airport. Easy to navigate, good shops and decent foodI've never had to deal with security here since i've only been here twice or layovers so I can't really say whether this airport is easy or difficult to navigate. The first time was when I was about 7 years old and got in trouble with security for trying to play one of the slot machines, and the only other time was a couple years ago on a Southwest flight between San Diego and New York. If you do end up at the terminal with a sandwich place called Flatbreadz, you should check this place out. I wasn't expecting much but it was surprisingly a pretty good sandwich! I don't think there were too many other options for food there anyway.

You get a pretty cool view of the Strip on the left side of the plane when you take off from here. The slot machines in the airport is a kind of a cool idea - you get to experience a little taste of Vegas if you're just there for a layover, and it sure beats sitting at the gate doing nothing!So...um...yeah, it's an airport.  

That's it I guess...There are lots of slots in Vegas, and many of the are right here at the airport.  Good counter through security to gate experience.  Baggage inbound is slow when you are waiting.  I mean union labor slow...so check bags only if flying into LAS.

Enjoy!Old, dark and dirty.  Only great thing is security that moves very fast and efficient.  Great job security.  Now if Nevada can only afford to brighten up the airport and take the dark ugly casino carpet out and make it whiter, fresher and cleaner.TIP:  use their free wifi here (very spotty though)

i only fly southwest here at McCarran, and the layout is very disjointed.  I can't say for other airlines but southwest has two areas with available gates.  So if you went to the wrong gate (or wanted to visit a friend from the other gate) , and that gate happens to be on the side, you have to pretty much run to the other side of the airport.  Also, the rental car center have to be shuttled (wastes time).  There is also one rental car company that is not even in the rental center (i think it's fox).  Do not rent from them!! they are far away, which is a waste of time.  Rentals in LV are cheap anyways.Really, slot machines in the airport? Advertisements for shirtless men and vending machines selling single roses? How much trashier can you get? At least McCarran actually functions as an airport fairly efficiently and the taxi line is super well organized.Who doesn't love sin city, seriously though it's time for Las Vegas to invest some money into re-doing the airport.  The baggage claim area is clean and organized but, the departure gates NEED help, the airport has a dark, dreary feel to it.It's an airport. 

Thats' it. 

Lots of people watching, and starting at the future drunks. 

Free Wifi rocks though.More fun to arrive at than depart from - a metaphor for Vegas. Baggage claim is festive and the cab situation is good. But, it's dingy and in need of a major reno job.

Note: the BK super value meal was $12 for the tendercrisp sandwich. Whoa.You'd think Vegas would have a rockin airport, but this one is actually kind of shabby as airports go. But the option to 'buy' yourself a seat at a slot machine while you wait for a flight is unmatched.Its an airport what can you write about? Its usually Terminal 2 for us because we fly Hawaiian Airlines. They added a self check-in but I still use the counter. Nice friendly people. Security lines go pretty fast. Bathrooms are alway clean. Could use a little more variety when it comes to the eating places available sorry but Burger King and Pizza Hut dont cut it. Always enjoy the slot machines! One last chance to hit it big! Haha, right!Actually, not a bad airport after all.  The tram reminds me of Seattle and the airport is clean & modern.  Something I can't say for HNL International.  Much better food vendors here than the pathetic selection at LAX.  

Flight coming here from LAX was full of excited, wide-eyed and hopeful pilgrims.  Reverse flight after Labor Day weekend wasn't so cheery as people looked beaten down, almost somber. 

LAS even has slots at the gates so you can try your luck or run it further in the hole.  Pick your poison.  Only drawback was the transport vans being outside.  In summer heat, it's crazy hot!  Insane heat vapors rising everywhere.  Once 'This would be a shity place to die', crossed my mind, my van pulled up.  Ah, thank you Jesus!

My last Vegas entry for awhile.  ¡Adiós Vegas!  Already looking forward to my next visit.  Hopefully it's not in another ten years, ha!

#Yelp 365:  058/365An older airport, but you always get that excitement as soon as you land, but when you leave, you just want to get the hell out of here. The lines to the taxis are always long, but move so quickly, you wouldnt even realize how many people are standing in line in front of you. Checking in is easy, as well as the security line, but I decided to get a pat-down instead of goign through the x-ray machine, and I think I waited over 5 minutes for female assistance. Maybe even 10. By that point, I should've just done the x-ray machine, but I was stubborn. The walk to Gate B takes FOREVER and a day. I think I am just too used to our nice little airport, SJC, so all the other airports seem a bit ghetto to me.Simple, not too far from town. Just watch out for slow moving people.It's flashy, just like Vegas. They have slots in the airport (the tightest slots in the land, from what I hear) and the usual spate of chain eateries and Starbux. It smells like cigarettes, anticipation and desperation in here. 

I'm so spoiled by PDX. But I guess the good thing is that when I'm arriving at McCarran I know I'm in for a good time and when I pass through on the way out I'm just glad to have escaped The Strip with my life and whatever remaining $$ I happened to sneak out with. 

Oh, and the line for taxis is always ridic. You think they'd come up with a better solution.You know you're in Vegas when you see slots before baggage pickup.  Was pretty clean and baggage pickup was easy.McCarran is voluminous and aging, kind of like the LV convention center.  The majority of the airport could use a face-lift, especially the interior silver facade that lines much of the access ways headed to terminals and gate areas.  However, cannot complain about the efficiency of departing; I've never stood in a security line longer than 15 minutes, and my fellow Bears and I have been to Vegas probably 12 to 15 times over the past few years, and have departed at various times/days without trouble.  The airport generally does not experience weather delays, so that's a plus too.  We've used the Continental lounge as well, which is small but comfortable and clean.  The only issues this airport has to contend with outside of an overhaul are the speed at which bags arrive at the baggage carousels,  and occasionally the long taxi rides.  I've rented a car here on multiple occasions and have never had any difficulties or long waits, etc.I never have any issues when it comes to the McCarran airport.  

When departing the security lines are quick and organized. 

When you land here everything is marked as where to go.  The taxi guy has a great system of loading people in the 20+ cab slots.Slot machines in an airport?? Um..ok. As far as airports go, it's pretty middle-ground. Nothing super-special, and nothing too horrible. Just alright.Ay, what can I say? It's an AIRPORT. By American Airport standards McCarran probably ranks about a four. But anyone who's been to Chiangi Airport in Singapore or Munich Airport or even Bangkok Airport can tell you how inefficiently even the most efficient airport in America operates.

Nonetheless, check-in at McCarran was fast and easy and despite the long security line I got through pretty quickly which was great since I was hung over.
From there getting to my gate was not a problem. I have to say that TSA at McCarran were the nicest and most laid back I've experienced at any airport in this country. 

Again, citing my hungover state, it would have been nice to have more food (as in hangover food) venues in my immediate gate area. A smoothy wasn't going to cut and the lone Mexican place had a long line (and the site of margaritas scared me and sent me in the other direction)
So for America, not a bad airport.They need better food options. It's dirty and smelly. But what can I expect, its the gateway to sin city!Not a bad airport overall, they have the new security scanners that you are required to go through otherwise they give you a thorough fondling in front of God and everybody...not a fan of that...They are either going to see it or feel it...in detail, so be prepared for that.The southwest terminal C needs a facelift.  It smells funny. The terminal also needs healthier food restaurants. Terminal D is quite nice, it has better restaurants and shops. Terminal A and B also need a facelift and better restaurants.  They seem to have a lot of sweet shops. 

Free wi-fi!Meh. There is a good selection of food here, but I don't like the tram thing. I guess that is better than walking the whole way. Its also strange that the car rental is a good 2 or more miles away. Better plan your time for the return flight!!Good airport, Chill TSA. 

Airport is clean, large, and surprisingly quiet - at least when you are departing. I am not a fan of the way baggage claim is set up, it's a bit of a mish mash maze. Can you say that 10 times real fast? 
Always allocate time for the taxi queue. It moves pretty quick, but you will wait in line - any time of day. It's great to make friends in this line, and depending on your party size, carpool onto the strip.Good airport, not too big. clean. free wifi. Vivaaa las baygusssThis isn't a huge airport, but dodging slot machines and construction makes it seem that way. The baggage claim area is huge and seems disorganized but somehow works.

The taxi line is long but moves really fast. When you get in your cab, make sure they don't take you way around on the west side of the strip through the tunnel. That'll add an unnecessary $10 or so on the fare. If you're dying for an In-and-Out Burger (when there are so many great restaurants in this town!), that route is for you then.Short term parking used to be better.  They used to have meters so you could hang out by your car and only pay if an attendant walked up.  Now you have to either drive in circles or pay something like $3 an hour.  You really do have to drive in circles as security are nazis and won't let you idle for more than 30 seconds.

The TSA security lines are very fast considering the volume of passengers they serve.

Some airlines *cough*united*cough*american*cough* have long lines for check-in, but that's the airline's fault in my opinion.  Arrive 1.5-2.0 hours early for any flight and you'll be fine.

Food choices are average.  I usually just do Burger King in the C gates as you can refill your soda whenever you want.  For D gates I usually do Ruby's Diner.

Long term parking at the remote lot is very affordable ($8 per day) and not all too inconvenient.

Baggage carousels are insanely slow.  You'll wait and wait forever for your luggage to arrive.

Free WiFi is very very awesome.  Good strength.  Free.I was expecting to be hit with a cloud of cigarette smoke when I got off the plane, but didn't which was a nice surprise. For where this is located, it's an okay airport. I definitely know where I'm at with all the slot machines around.My GOD this place is way too busy for there to only be 3 TSA agents on staff. Seriously.

The taxi line is way fast and super efficient, which is beautiful. Other than that, it's an airport. Not much else to say.Terminal 3 is awesome. Terminal 1 A/B gates blah. Terminal 1 C gates meh. It's like the vegas airport knows it can suck because people are already drunk when they get off the plane. With all the taxes we get from tourists you'd think they could spruce the place up. Maybe put in some restaurants that people would actually want to eat at. We have world class dining on the strip and food court options at the airport. It's a sad state. Rant over.The heart of vegas air traffic.A huge airport!!!   Give yourself plenty of time to pick up a rental car if you plan to get one.   It is fairly easy to get to it though, just hop on a shuttle bus and it will take you to the rental car place!   

And if you didn't have enough slot machine experience in Las Vegas, don't worry! there are plenty of these machines at this airport!     

Also give yourself extra time to get to the gate on the return flight!!! again, it is a huge airport!!!I'm not going to win any points with the LV tourism bureau by saying that the lowlight of my life is always flying into Vegas and the highlight is flying out of.  Why?  I hate Vegas the way a mouse would a cat.  Vegas crouches in the shadows waiting to pounce on me and bite my head off by ripping my purse outta me and maxing out my credit cards and cash.

If you want to see what Vegas is like in an encapsulated and somewhat dated place (like a casino that's gone past it's hey day), hang out at the McCarran Airport for a few hours.  Sure, it's added some space and parts of it are newer than others, but they still have those old clunker slot machines and the tacky souvenir shops.  

The security lines are some of the longest I've ever encountered (Depends on the time and day too).  Booze is everywhere (it goes hand in hand with the gambling, you know) - all that's missing are those foot-long margaritas, the strip joints or the people standing around hawking stuff or throwing the titty bar cards at you.  But if the McCarran airport had all of that, you wouldn't leave the airport and experience Vegas itself now, would you?Pro: You can gamble (slots) in this airport when there is a delay.
Con: You can lose money in this airport when there is a delay.

Pro: Several food options are spread throughout the terminal.
Con: None of these places are places I really want to eat at.

Pro: The airport is so close to the Strip that you think you might be landing on the Strip during approach.
Con: It's still a $40 cab ride from the airport to the Strip.

Pro: Vegas knows how to handle a line efficiently.
Con: Lines for everything are long.

So, it's not the worst airport I've ever flown into, but it isn't exactly awesomesauce either. However, the excitement when you land is palpable, just as the hangovers on departures are.McCarran and JFK always force me to choose between renouncing pescatarianism or starving for a couple more hours. The latter tends to win out.

On top of that, I would like to mention that the last time I was here, all the outlets for several gates were dead. I think all the sockets in that area (Southwest) were just dead. Several ppl complained. Come on maintenance ppl!The Las Vegas airport is a bit tacky but it's Vegas so get used to it.  It's quite interesting walking around the airport, no one really wants to play the slots but yet it's there so there's almost an obligation.  You do see the crazy and excited people arriving and hurrying to get to the strip and then you also see lots of slow goers that are still hurting from the nights' festivities.Show up early, and pay for TSA Pre-Check. Nothing I like about this airport, but nothing I absolutely hate.Unique in several ways, mainly the ubiquitous presence of slot machines everywhere including the main terminals and concourses within a few feet of the arrival/departure gates, complete with attendants to make change or  pay off winnings, and cocktails on sale next to the slots.    The layout of the airport is a bit sprawling so it is a bit of a hike from check-in at American to the departure concourse & gates.   Understand this is due to an expansion/redesign that eliminates the prior cramped arrangement so it is a trade off.   Very nice that the airport is located within sight of the strip and casino hotels.This seems like a perfectly good airport, but not the best. There aren't enough seats for everyone, that's for sure - but that may be because the slot machines at every gate take up so much space. At least if you get there early, as we did, you don't have to waste any time in Vegas not gambling! The boyfriend won a good amount of money while we were waiting for our plane.It's an airport... in Las Vegas. Which means a few slot machines int he walk ways...and that is fine by me.
Everything else has always worked out fine for me.
There are always plenty of cabs outside...the baggage never seems to take too long...and even at 2am..the staff doesn't seem to be in any less of a decent mood then at 2pm.It was my first time in Vegas. The airport itself isn't as large as what I had expected it to be. Easy to walk and navigate through. Watching people still playing on the slot machines before boarding their flight was a hoot.If your flight is delayed and you have to hang out here.... bummer. Other than that it's just another airport. It is small and surprisingly because it's Las Vegas Baby! I mean you do expect much more of an entrance to Sin City. The decor is older from the seating to the restrooms. 

Highlights: As soon as you arrive, there is a lovely little spirits store called the Liquor Library. I think this is a very convenient way to jump-start your time in Las Vegas. Also, the shuttle staff was very helpful. I got a shuttle round trip for $18. I'd call that a deal. 

I've gone over the pros and cons. I think your experience is different depending on the time you arrive to Las Vegas. I was on an early AM flight and everyone was jovial and helpful. I left on a later PM flight and everyone seemed over it. Much like they didn't want to be there. Who can blame them? If you've had the pleasure of flying into or out of Atlanta Hartsfield, Charlotte Douglas or Orlando International, you are probably thinking WTF as soon as you touch down here. 

But why complain? It's Las Vegas! Go have a great time that you'll barely recollect.This airport is eh.. Check ins was a horrible experience and security was very rude. 

However, you can drink, there are slots, slots, slots every where and a place to charge your phone. Easy airport to get around.Pretty easy to navigate, the only real thing that sucks is the food. And that the slots don't let you win. :) But what slot in Vegas does?

Other than that security was relatively painless and I've never had a problem flying out from here. There was a nice charging station near my gate.If you're flying an airline that flies out of terminal 3 like United, you better give yourself an extra 20-30 minutes. The terminal 3 security line is far far far slower than terminal 1.Well, "Viva Las Vegas!"

This seems to be a hub for Virgin America. Interesting, interesting.

That's about it.This airport needs a makeover. Chairs are uncomfortable, it's hot, and outlets are far too few and far between. 

One nice thing, though, is the TSA Pre Check lanes. At least I can breeze through security here!Quick Summary: If you're spending time in the Vegas airport, you're doing it wrong.

I've had the joy of coming through McCarran plenty of times, especially since I've decided it is not worth it to drive to Vegas anymore... and for an airport it isn't that bad. 

When you're departing, I find that security is fairly quick. I've never spent more than 20min in line, without TSA pre-check. The terminal can get pretty long so be prepared to hustle if you've got a gate at the end and running a bit short on time. They've got free wifi, without downloading an app or watching a video, which is really nice. They've got a good variety of shops that seem to be open at all odds of hours and they've upped the number of charging stations available.

And if you didn't have enough of throwing your money away, they have slots available throughout... I'm more a table game sort of guy myself, but I think it's more for the novelty of being in Vegas than anything else. If you've got time to play slots in the airport... refer to my quick summary.

When you're arriving, things seem to flow pretty quickly, though to be honest, I don't ever check a bag going to Vegas so I can't speak to that aspect.  One BIG NOTE: if you're taking a taxi onto the strip. Anywhere on the strip from the Mandalay Bay to the Wynn, DO NOT agree to take the freeway/highway.  They're gouging you. The airport authorities have taken notice of this gouging and have started to post signs and what not... but they still try. Take Paradise / surface streets. It's much faster and cheaper. You shouldn't have to pay more than $20 for anywhere on the strip.

All in all, it's a decent airport... no real thrills or frills... aside from the slots... I would have expected some more lights... some glitz... maybe a little glamour to welcome you to Sin City... but then again... why are you hanging out in the airport in VEGAS?!I use this airline a lot since I fly for work  between SoCal and Vegas.  If I were paying  for the flight, think I'd go with Jet Blue instead.  but since I'm not, I get what I get.  Do not like the open seating. I have a disability with my leg that prevents me from bending it very much without excruciating pain. So... I have to do the bulkhead seat.  I pre-board, but fat lot of good that does when you are getting on a flight that already has other people on it  . Mostly the crew and attendants are nice and helpful but there is one named Beverly at the Vegas location who is a complete uber biatch. I have reported her terrible attitude to the airline. I don't mind a lot of things since it is only a one hour flight for me, but I DO mind that the last 3 trips .. my flights have been delayed because they were cancelled since the airplanes were not full.  Even if I were in perfect health, wandering around the Vegas airport for 4-8 hours is a form of torture.. But to do it with a bum knee and not have anyplace to elevate it.. makes mama grouchy...I LOVE: convenient flights, Early Bird check in option, free checked bags, great frequent flier program, friendly staff. When it works, it's fantastic.

I HATE:  their text and email notification system doesn't work.   If I had relied on that, I would still be waiting at the airport for my flight last week. They also didn't update the web site quickly....the Polar Vortex was wreaking havoc on air travel so I totally understand my flight being delayed twice then canceled.  What I DON'T understand is why they couldn't text me alerts as promised and keep their web site updated. 

ALSO I suspect they cancel flights when they don't have enough passengers.  I once booked a 6 am flight to Phoenix and learned it was canceled AFTER I got to the airport (thanks, text system).  Then I had a flight from Oakland to LAX which they delayed and canceled AFTER I'd left my conference early.  The new flight they put me on was delayed....which they DID manage to text me, and then just as I settled in they texted me again that it was leaving in 5 minutes.  Oh, thanks?A basic Avis location at the airport.  The bus always takes to long to pick you up to bring you to the rental center, but so be it.  It is the same bus for all the rental companies so it is not like you have a choice.

Avis cars were clean and all worked out well.This place is where I go whenever I am filling up the tank. It's got some of the cheapest prices in the valley. It has the unfortunate location right next to the 7-11 so you don't really see this place because the sign is small and the place is pretty dimly lit.

They also run a really great special of $5.99 for a 6-pack of coronas. 
There's not really a huge selection of snacks & drinks but what they do have is really cheap. 

But as bad as it sounds, some times I just don't want to stop there because there is ALWAYS at least on homeless person hanging around the parking lot, and dealing with it EVERY time gets old.We used to always hit this place when we were in Vegas back in the day... even back when they were located on the other side...  (don't go as often now since the comps at the Cal are lame)  Local plate with beef teri, chicken teri, and spam musubi is killer.  Get an extra side of their mac salad as well.  Their saimin and teri burgers are decent as well.I made a visit early one morning after a long night of gambling.  I was the lone haole in the place.

I was surprised to see Spam as a prevalent item on the menu.  Spam is nasty.  My mom, the child of Norwegian immigrants, used to tell me that her parents brought out Spam on special occasions.  Ugh.  She didn't have indoor plumbing at the time, so there you go.

I've been to the Hormel plant in Austin, MN where Spam is made.  It's comprised mostly of leftovers from the kill floor.  They use everything from the pig except for the squeal.  Trust me on this one.  Everything but the squeal.

Yes, I did try the spam musubi.  Thanks for asking!

I also had the Moco Loco, which looks like a big pile of cow excrement.  It's comprised of white rice, seasoned ground beef, two or three eggs, and brown gravy.  Very tasty with some Tabasco on top!  I'm a fat guy already, but I'd be over three bills if I ate this dish with any regularity.  

I'm knocking off a star because the staff was relatively rude.  Perhaps it was because I'm not Polynesian, but I cannot be sure.

Nothing fancy here, but give it a shot if you want to try something different.   It sure helped the old hangover.Better than a 3, not quite a 4. 

The place is packed with large Island people mowing on large plates of delicious looking food. How does one NOT eat here?!

Enjoyed chicken, beef, fish combo plate. YUM! Stuffed. 

Unless you're a sumo wrestler, share a plate. If you're still hungry get another plate. These are HUGE PORTIONS!We always come here assoon as we get into Vegas.  This time it was a disappointment for me the Korean chicken was good but it seem kind of small.  The fried saimen did not have the Chinese cabbage they had a lot of celery instead.  The saimen soup was over done and not al dente and it was just not Meeting my craving.  I was kind of sad... I think it was the cook for this day and time. I'll be back but just not happy this trip.Meh. I must've gotten the wrong thing because I was not overly impressed. The teriyaki sauce on the ribeye was way too thick and sugary, and I scraped as much off as possible. The macaroni salad had good flavor but it didn't pair well with what I ate. Not really worth the walk up Fremont St. for me, but YMMV.I'm a big fan of some of the old school properties in Vegas when it come to a change up over the glitz and glamour of new school properties.. Binion's is that kind of property that is dated, it's smokey, it's cheap, it's seen it's days but you can't beat it up to much the gambling is good, the staff seemed nice etc.. I liked it for the little short time I was there..I work nearby so I eat here about once a month, not because the food is bad but because I don't like eating sandwich more than once a month. 

Anyway, they have 3 items I consider to be in the "good to really good" range. Pastrami sandwich, brisket sandwich, and sausage sandwich. I heard from my co workers that their house salad is good too. I'm not a salad person =)Doña Maria's is a classic family-style Mexican restaurant, from the grey vinyl booths to the "cantina" inspired decor. From the outside it doesn't look like much...a squat, dusty building with bars on the windows. Yet, considering that it's been around since 1980--practically Biblical times in Vegas years--you know it's probably pretty decent. 

I arrived for happy hour at 4:00, walking from the nearby bus stop. Other reviewers have (accurately) described the neighborhood as dicey, but it's perfectly fine in the afternoon. I ordered a jumbo lime margarita for $4.95 which was roughly the size of my head. It was far from a masterpiece, but certainly got the job done!

The chips & salsa were fair--chunky corn chips in a thick, fruity salsa. I followed up with a bean & cheese burrito. In addition to being one of my favorite dishes, it's a surprisingly reliable benchmark of quality. It arrived, somewhat alarmingly, in two minutes. The presentation was straight out of 1983, replete with the decorative lettuce and tomato garnish that inexplicably accompanies Mexican platters. It was fairly tasty--dripping with melted jack-- and I nibbled for about an hour as I emptied my glass. 

Apart from happy hour, it's not especially cheap. with a la carte lunch entrees in the $10 range and seafood dishes exceeding $17. While hardly outrageous, I personally expect a bit more individual attention and detail for these prices. Nonetheless, I'll probably return to Doña Maria's and write up a full review of their eponymous tamales.We always seem to end up here for hours playing blackjack......they had a new concept this time....dealer-dancers. Young, pretty, and fun at the tables. They do have one dancer that will make your yummy shrimp cocktail come back up if you accidentally get a glimpse of her.......but even the "non-rhythmic" need jobs! Don't expect a lot of frills, but be ready to have fun and experience "old" Vegas at its finest!We didn't stay at the hotel... just stopped in for the "Original Shrimp Cocktail of Las Vegas" ($1.99 each). It was worth the money and we also had some of their cheap draft beer, a beerbrat sandwich and a fountain soda. Only drawback... NO REFILLS! 

Otherwise the shrimp cocktails were worth it. Plus many other affordable eating options were closed on this particular Sunday afternoon.This restaurant is closed.Now that I know that they kill 61% if the animals who come here, I am even more thankful that I found my dog and saved her from the needle. I give them 3 stars only because I don't want to deter others from adopting...the animals here need it the most, as they have the least chance at life. That being said, their policy of euthanizing older dogs and any dog with a minor health problem is wrong and disturbing.Not bad for a bus station at all. The Security is very good here. Friendly and Professional. Most of the greyhound workers are less than helpful, but that is the fault of the manager, I think his name was George. He came out twice and yelled at the employees, yelled at Security than went back into his office instead of actually supervising people or improving any aspect of the operation or employee development. The restrooms were clean, but the vending machines were broken. They have a McDonald's next door at the Plaza Hotel, so no big deal.use this greyhound often. The employees are pretty nice and helpful. 

This location is pretty rundown.  There is not enough seating. There are ALWAYS people laying all over the floor, half which are homeless people. 

Good thing though, usually If you prInt tIcket at home, gettIng on bus Is pretty quIck and sImple.

 I don't like greyhounds policies about refunds and changing tickets though... they pretty much don't give refunds or really bother to help out when it comes to giving people their money back."The Cal" is ground zero for people in Hawaii to come and play in Vegas. Odd since it's called the California Hotel after another state. Anyways, for people to get away from Hawaii, they stay at a place that has all the amenities of Hawaii of course. Located off The Strip in downtown Las Vegas it sits among many of the older casinos and hotels. It connects to Main Street Station, but they're pretty much one and the same thing. They're both great inexpensive options. A late night diner is here and one of the draws is their oxtail soup. Add a fruit punch to that and it's like you're in Hawaii (or you never left).

If you're from Hawaii it often happens you wander though only to see friends or family there too! Ai-yah, the "9th Hawaiian Island" is way too small!We wanted to try the breakfast buffet, so we made the effort and woke up before 10 AM.

The buffet is 7 - 11 AM I believe for $5.99 that includes a drink.

I think the best thing they had was the hash browns with gravy over it. The eggs and meats weren't that good. The fruit and french toast were decent. 

Would I wake up for this again? No. 
If I were up before 10 AM and was hungry, I would drive over here...

Not great, but at least it's cheapI'm so tired of this place.  It needs to be renovated.  When I was a kid, I remember my parents dragging me to Las Vegas every summer.  I hated Las Vegas.  At the time there wasn't a lot to do if you're a child.  Now there's a ton of stuff to make Las Vegas a family friendly vacation destination.  

Sorry to say, the California looks so beat up and run down.  Please just tear the hotel and casino down and start over.  People from Hawaii love the Cal, but if they don't do something to improve the facilities Boyd Gaming will lose all their loyal patrons to the Las Vegas Strip casinos, which are really affordable now.Pizza was just ok. Ordered a whole pizza for my friends as we were staying at the El Cortez. Would have rather had pop up pizza but didn't want to walk to other end of fremont and back in the rain.This place is pretty regular to me. A good place to come when you're drunk. 

The pizza is pretty mediocre. If you order just a slice of pizza it just looks like it's a cheese pizza & they just place the toppings on top and not do much with it. I like how it's thin crust, it does the job right as far as it being sober up food but ehhhh I probably wouldn't come here when I'm  sober to eat.The Fremont has a great seafood buffet for under $20 a person. The seating area is gaudy as hell with emerald green everything accented with gold - it's SO Vegas. Service was great - it was super busy but we were never out of something to drink and the plates were cleared before you came back with your next round. 

The seafood buffet has snow crab, king crab, oysters, shrimp (scampi, cocktail, deep fried, and cooked with shell on), mussels, clams, smoked salmon, and sushi. To be honest, the sushi isn't that great but are you really going to a buffet for the sushi? There's also really great prime rib but get there when they first  bring out the meat because the medium rare part is the best. So it's not the BEST buffet in town but it's cheap and good so I would say it gets the job done.

Validation gets you free valet parking for the first 3 hours.Another good time gambling.  Love the inexpensive drinks and low table limits, similar to the other casinos on Fremont Street.  I have not stayed in the hotel, and I don't plan on it.  This review is for the CASINO ONLY.

During our most recent trip, the lights went out while we were having fun.  Just before I started to get scared about mass panic with everyone rushing for the doors and someone getting shot over stealing chips, the lights came back on.  Total time elapsed was about 10 seconds, which wasn't so bad.  I don't really think that was the hotel's fault, it was crazy-windy that night and I'm sure that could have had something to do with it.

The bad part was the two hours that it took for the slot machines to come back on.  After waiting the two hours and several "sorry for the inconvenience" announcements the manager was doing what he could do to make it up those folks that still had money in a machine that had yet to come back up.  I respect an establishment with good customer service practices.As far as gambling this place is pretty good. Low minimums on the card tables and wide selections for slots. Good location right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience. The rooms are adequate, meaning old and outdated. But it is kept clean by the staff so if you're on a budget its okay. Buffet is not bad and Tony Roma's is also here.INITIAL POST ON 11/16/2012:  Nothing at all wrong with the casino in the mornings and early afternoons. By late afternoon, though, I have to leave because of the constant, irritating loud speaker announcements.

  "Table 32 is ready at Tony Roma's.  Table 32, Tony Roma's."  "Table 33 is ready at Tony Roma's.  Table 33, Tony Roma's...."

The announcement bellows through the ENTIRE casino.  Could the blinky buzzers utilized by other restaurants be put into play?  Certainly.  But then, the rib joint wouldn't get the free ads to casino patrons.

There are too many other casinos just a few steps away.  The unnecessary, aggravating, loud announcements start...and I stop at the Fremont.  Ugh.


UPDATE ON 10/25/2013:  It seems the Tony Roma blaring, annoying loudspeaker announcements are not just to alleviate any "unsafe" crowds gathering around the restaurant.  I met a friend at the Fremont last night.  We had to stop our conversation every time the loud announcements for the restaurant were made...and they are frustratingly often.  Then, a few minutes before 10 pm, there were TWO blaring announcements:  "There is currently no wait for tables at Tony Roma's.  Immediate seating is available now at Tony Roma's."

Please, I'm begging you, stop it!!!  Figure out another way to promote the damn restaurant.  Give people blinky buzzers, as is the case with other restaurants.  Don't pretend those horridy, obnoxious announcements are necessary.  They're not.  And they sure don't make me want to go to the rib joint or spend much time in the casino!!Casino area has a great staff and a friendly waitress. It has Duncan Donuts which is a plus for me since I love pastries. Lanai express is a good place for a quick place to grab a bite to eat. The buffet was great with a decent selection. As far as the room, it ok and the bathroom was really small. Shower floor looked like it was the only thing that wasn't renovated. All in all I had a great time. We usually stay at the California.Met the sweetest cocktail waitress who was old enough to be my grandma. Had lots of fun here at the slots on my first night in Vegas. It's smokey and could use some renovations, but whatever. I'm just here for oxtail soup from Lanai Express! Yeah, buddy!I was a little skeptical when we booked due to some reviews,however we always stay on the strip so we tried this hotel. To my surprise the room was
 clean and for the low price was worth it. Staff was friendly and attentive if we              needed something. I would come stay here again. Plus we got 4 breakfast and lunch free coupons. Wi fi is not free,9.99 per day.  I would not pay for the dinner buffet again though. Website says no fridge. When we called for reservation ,they told us the same thing,however when we checked in we asked about a fridge and she said we could have one ,no charge so I guess they don't offer one unless requested.I've heard some mixed things about Hugo's. The atmosphere is old school vegas. The table side salad was good, but can't they use different bowls to mix when people get different dressings??? Had the scallops festival or something like that. It was good, but interesting. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but the sauce they were in was almost like a beef gravy. After a bite I just felt like I was eating a super tender steak covered in rich gravy. Kind of strange. But it was good. The chocolate dipped fruit plate they give for dessert was good too.I really wanted a great steak before I left Vegas and since I was staying downtown I decided to try Hugos.  It's in the Four Queens which meant we had to walk through a huge line waiting for the $7.99 Prime Rib at the restaurant next door.  This should have been my first clue this wouldn't be the steak I was looking for.  The atmosphere is very old school and probably good for your parents anniversary but not great if you're under 40.  But I was here for the meat so it wasn't really an issue.  The first problem though was the beer list wasn't very extensive (mostly domestics) and the server didn't know much about the imports.  My buddy ended end with a wheat beer with apple flavor which was not something he wanted.  Mine was a Samuel Smith Pale Ale which was quite good.  I ordered a medium rare New York Strip with a warm center and a crisp exterior and my friend tried the salmon.  First was a salad they prepare table side but it lacked flavor.  The steak was a little better but still not the mind blowing experience I was looking for at $50 a steak.  The salmon was also run of the mill.Ooo-Weee, this place is FANCY.  Make you wanna wear a really pretty dress and get all dolled up fancy.  Who knew a place like this existed in Downtown Las Vegas.  Well, apparently this chick knows now.

I came for a friend of my cousin's birthday.  At first glimpse, this place seems a bit cramped.  True to it's name (cellar), you go down stairs to get to this little place.  The lobby area is a bit small, so if it gets crowded, it may only  be standing room only.  Once we were seated, each girl was brought to the table and given a long stemmed red rose.  I know, cheesy ... but it was cute nonetheless.

They have a great selection of seafood and meat.  First course was salad.  Their salad was delicious, and I probably could have just made the salad my whole meal.  Not a side salad.  This baby takes up your whole plate, and comes with all the fixings.  Of course, you get to pick which fixings you want on it.  I also had some of their bread.  I especially enjoyed the lavosh.  It was crispy and flaky, and something different from the ordinary bread given at restaurants, although that was served as well.

After much deliberation, I chose the filet mignon. Very tender, juicy, and well cooked (medium rare, just the way I like it).  I was pleased with my choice.  I also got to try the Escargot en Croute.  It was my first time tasting escargot, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.  However, I know I liked it, and will be willing to have it again.

If you're in the mood to be fancy, hit this place up.  However, it is definitely on the pricey side.  For me, great to try once on my dime, but I hope next time it'll be on someone else's.We love the atmosphere at Hugo's. 5 stars for atmosphere but based on the last 2 times here the food does not rate as high. Table side salad is great, lobster bisque excellent. But the steak my wife had was not great.  I had a seafood trio consisting of shrimp, sea bass and crab cake. Just ok. If I can convince my wife Richella I will try again sometime. Love the place for the atmosphere and service!
